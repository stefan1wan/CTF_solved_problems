English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and is now a global lingua franca.[4][5] Named after the Angles, one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to the area of Britain that would later take their name, England, both names ultimately deriving from the Anglia peninsula in the Baltic Sea. It is closely related to the Frisian languages, but its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages, particularly Norse (a North Germanic language), as well as by Latin and French.[6]

English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years. The earliest forms of English, a set of Anglo-Frisian dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century, are called Old English. Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England and was a period in which the language was influenced by French.[7] Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London, the printing of the King James Bible and the start of the Great Vowel Shift.[8]

Through the worldwide influence of the British Empire, modern English spread around the world from the 17th to mid-20th centuries. Through all types of printed and electronic media, and spurred by the emergence of the United States as a global superpower, English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and professional contexts such as science, navigation and law.[9]

English is the third most spoken native language in the world, after Standard Chinese and Spanish.[10] It is the most widely learned second language and is either the official language or one of the official languages in almost 60 sovereign states. There are more people who have learned it as a second language than there are native speakers. English is the most commonly spoken language in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand, and it is widely spoken in some areas of the Caribbean, Africa and South Asia.[11] It is a co-official language of the United Nations, the European Union and many other world and regional international organisations. It is the most widely spoken Germanic language, accounting for at least 70% of speakers of this Indo-European branch. English has a vast vocabulary, though counting how many words any language has is impossible.[12][13] English speakers are called "Anglophones".

Modern English grammar is the result of a gradual change from a typical Indo-European dependent marking pattern with a rich inflectional morphology and relatively free word order to a mostly analytic pattern with little inflection, a fairly fixed SVO word order and a complex syntax.[14] Modern English relies more on auxiliary verbs and word order for the expression of complex tenses, aspect and mood, as well as passive constructions, interrogatives and some negation. Despite noticeable variation among the accents and dialects of English used in different countries and regions – in terms of phonetics and phonology, and sometimes also vocabulary, grammar and spelling – English-speakers from around the world are able to communicate with one another with relative ease.

Phylogenetic tree showing the historical relations between the languages of the West Germanic branch of the Germanic languages
English is an Indo-European language and belongs to the West Germanic group of the Germanic languages.[15] Old English originated from a Germanic tribal and linguistic continuum along the coast of the North Sea, whose languages are now known as the Anglo-Frisian subgroup within West Germanic. As such, the modern Frisian languages are the closest living relatives of Modern English. Low German/Low Saxon is also closely related, and sometimes English, the Frisian languages, and Low German are grouped together as the Ingvaeonic (North Sea Germanic) languages, though this grouping remains debated.[16] Old English evolved into Middle English, which in turn evolved into Modern English.[17] Particular dialects of Old and Middle English also developed into a number of other Anglic languages, including Scots[18] and the extinct Fingallian and Forth and Bargy (Yola) dialects of Ireland.[19]

Like Icelandic and Faroese, the development of English on the British Isles isolated it from the continental Germanic languages and influences, and has since undergone substantial evolution. English is thus not mutually intelligible with any continental Germanic language, differing in vocabulary, syntax, and phonology, although some, such as Dutch or Frisian, do show strong affinities with English, especially with its earlier stages.[20]

Unlike Icelandic or Faroese, the long history of invasions of the British Isles by other peoples and languages, particularly Old Norse and Norman French, left a profound mark of their own on the language, such that English shares substantial vocabulary and grammar similarities with many languages outside its linguistic clades, while also being unintelligible with any of those languages. Some scholars have even argued that English can be considered a mixed language or a creole – a theory called the Middle English creole hypothesis. Although the high degree of influence from these languages on the vocabulary and grammar of Modern English is widely acknowledged, most specialists in language contact do not consider English to be a true mixed language.[21][22]

English is classified as a Germanic language because it shares innovations with other Germanic languages such as Dutch, German, and Swedish.[23] These shared innovations show that the languages have descended from a single common ancestor called Proto-Germanic. Some shared features of Germanic languages include the use of modal verbs, the division of verbs into strong and weak classes, and the sound changes affecting Proto-Indo-European consonants, known as Grimm's and Verner's laws. English is classified as an Anglo-Frisian language because Frisian and English share other features, such as the palatalisation of consonants that were velar consonants in Proto-Germanic (see Phonological history of Old English § Palatalization).[24]

Proto-Germanic to Old English
Main article: Old English

The opening to the Old English epic poem Beowulf, handwritten in half-uncial script:
Hƿæt ƿē Gārde/na ingēar dagum þēod cyninga / þrym ge frunon...
"Listen! We of the Spear-Danes from days of yore have heard of the glory of the folk-kings..."
The earliest form of English is called Old English or Anglo-Saxon (c. 550–1066 CE). Old English developed from a set of North Sea Germanic dialects originally spoken along the coasts of Frisia, Lower Saxony, Jutland, and Southern Sweden by Germanic tribes known as the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. In the fifth century, the Anglo-Saxons settled Britain as the Roman economy and administration collapsed. By the seventh century, the Germanic language of the Anglo-Saxons became dominant in Britain, replacing the languages of Roman Britain (43–409 CE): Common Brittonic, a Celtic language, and Latin, brought to Britain by the Roman occupation.[25][26][27] England and English (originally Ænglaland and Ænglisc) are named after the Angles.[28]

Old English was divided into four dialects: the Anglian dialects, Mercian and Northumbrian, and the Saxon dialects, Kentish and West Saxon.[29] Through the educational reforms of King Alfred in the ninth century and the influence of the kingdom of Wessex, the West Saxon dialect became the standard written variety.[30] The epic poem Beowulf is written in West Saxon, and the earliest English poem, Cædmon's Hymn, is written in Northumbrian.[31] Modern English developed mainly from Mercian, but the Scots language developed from Northumbrian. A few short inscriptions from the early period of Old English were written using a runic script.[32] By the sixth century, a Latin alphabet was adopted, written with half-uncial letterforms. It included the runic letters wynn ⟨ƿ⟩ and thorn ⟨þ⟩, and the modified Latin letters eth ⟨ð⟩, and ash ⟨æ⟩.[32][33]

Old English is very different from Modern English and difficult for 21st-century English speakers to understand. Its grammar was similar to that of modern German, and its closest relative is Old Frisian. Nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and verbs had many more inflectional endings and forms, and word order was much freer than in Modern English. Modern English has case forms in pronouns (he, him, his) and a few verb endings (I have, he has), but Old English had case endings in nouns as well, and verbs had more person and number endings.[34][35][36]

The translation of Matthew 8:20 from 1000 CE shows examples of case endings (nominative plural, accusative plural, genitive singular) and a verb ending (present plural):

Foxas habbað holu and heofonan fuglas nest
Fox-as habb-að hol-u and heofon-an fugl-as nest-∅
fox-nom.pl have-prs.pl hole-acc.pl and heaven-gen.sg bird-nom.pl nest-acc.pl
"Foxes have holes and the birds of heaven nests"[37]
Middle English
Main article: Middle English
Englischmen þeyz hy hadde fram þe bygynnyng þre manner speche, Souþeron, Northeron, and Myddel speche in þe myddel of þe lond, … Noþeles by comyxstion and mellyng, furst wiþ Danes, and afterward wiþ Normans, in menye þe contray longage ys asperyed, and som vseþ strange wlaffyng, chyteryng, harryng, and garryng grisbytting.

Although, from the beginning, Englishmen had three manners of speaking, southern, northern and midlands speech in the middle of the country, … Nevertheless, through intermingling and mixing, first with Danes and then with Normans, amongst many the country language has arisen, and some use strange stammering, chattering, snarling, and grating gnashing.
John of Trevisa, ca. 1385[38]
In the period from the 8th to the 12th century, Old English gradually transformed through language contact into Middle English. Middle English is often arbitrarily defined as beginning with the conquest of England by William the Conqueror in 1066, but it developed further in the period from 1200–1450.

First, the waves of Norse colonisation of northern parts of the British Isles in the 8th and 9th centuries put Old English into intense contact with Old Norse, a North Germanic language. Norse influence was strongest in the Northeastern varieties of Old English spoken in the Danelaw area around York, which was the centre of Norse colonisation; today these features are still particularly present in Scots and Northern English. However the centre of norsified English seems to have been in the Midlands around Lindsey, and after 920 CE when Lindsey was reincorporated into the Anglo-Saxon polity, Norse features spread from there into English varieties that had not been in intense contact with Norse speakers. Some elements of Norse influence that persist in all English varieties today are the pronouns beginning with th- (they, them, their) which replaced the Anglo-Saxon pronouns with h- (hie, him, hera).[39]

With the Norman conquest of England in 1066, the now norsified Old English language was subject to contact with the Old Norman language, a Romance language closely related to Modern French. The Norman language in England eventually developed into Anglo-Norman. Because Norman was spoken primarily by the elites and nobles, while the lower classes continued speaking Anglo-Saxon, the influence of Norman consisted of introducing a wide range of loanwords related to politics, legislation and prestigious social domains.[40] Middle English also greatly simplified the inflectional system, probably in order to reconcile Old Norse and Old English, which were inflectionally different but morphologically similar. The distinction between nominative and accusative case was lost except in personal pronouns, the instrumental case was dropped, and the use of the genitive case was limited to describing possession. The inflectional system regularised many irregular inflectional forms,[41] and gradually simplified the system of agreement, making word order less flexible.[42] By the Wycliffe Bible of the 1380s, the passage Matthew 8:20 was written

Foxis han dennes, and briddis of heuene han nestis[43]
Here the plural suffix -n on the verb have is still retained, but none of the case endings on the nouns are present.

By the 12th century Middle English was fully developed, integrating both Norse and Norman features; it continued to be spoken until the transition to early Modern English around 1500. Middle English literature includes Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, and Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur. In the Middle English period, the use of regional dialects in writing proliferated, and dialect traits were even used for effect by authors such as Chaucer.

Early Modern English
Main article: Early Modern English

Graphic representation of the Great Vowel Shift, showing how the pronunciation of the long vowels gradually shifted, with the high vowels i: and u: breaking into diphthongs and the lower vowels each shifting their pronunciation up one level
The next period in the history of English was Early Modern English (1500–1700). Early Modern English was characterised by the Great Vowel Shift (1350–1700), inflectional simplification, and linguistic standardisation.

The Great Vowel Shift affected the stressed long vowels of Middle English. It was a chain shift, meaning that each shift triggered a subsequent shift in the vowel system. Mid and open vowels were raised, and close vowels were broken into diphthongs. For example, the word bite was originally pronounced as the word beet is today, and the second vowel in the word about was pronounced as the word boot is today. The Great Vowel Shift explains many irregularities in spelling since English retains many spellings from Middle English, and it also explains why English vowel letters have very different pronunciations from the same letters in other languages.[44][45]

English began to rise in prestige, relative to Norman French, during the reign of Henry V. Around 1430, the Court of Chancery in Westminster began using English in its official documents, and a new standard form of Middle English, known as Chancery Standard, developed from the dialects of London and the East Midlands. In 1476, William Caxton introduced the printing press to England and began publishing the first printed books in London, expanding the influence of this form of English.[46] Literature from the Early Modern period includes the works of William Shakespeare and the translation of the Bible commissioned by King James I. Even after the vowel shift the language still sounded different from Modern English: for example, the consonant clusters /kn ɡn sw/ in knight, gnat, and sword were still pronounced. Many of the grammatical features that a modern reader of Shakespeare might find quaint or archaic represent the distinct characteristics of Early Modern English.[47]

In the 1611 King James Version of the Bible, written in Early Modern English, Matthew 8:20 says:

The Foxes haue holes and the birds of the ayre haue nests[37]
This exemplifies the loss of case and its effects on sentence structure (replacement with Subject-Verb-Object word order, and the use of of instead of the non-possessive genitive), and the introduction of loanwords from French (ayre) and word replacements (bird originally meaning "nestling" had replaced OE fugol).

Spread of Modern English
By the late 18th century, the British Empire had facilitated the spread of English through its colonies and geopolitical dominance. Commerce, science and technology, diplomacy, art, and formal education all contributed to English becoming the first truly global language. English also facilitated worldwide international communication.[48][9] As England continued to form new colonies, these, in turn, became independent and developed their own norms for how to speak and write the language. English was adopted in North America, India, parts of Africa, Australasia, and many other regions. In the post-colonial period, some of the newly created nations that had multiple indigenous languages opted to continue using English as the official language to avoid the political difficulties inherent in promoting any one indigenous language above the others.[49][50][51] In the 20th century the growing economic and cultural influence of the United States and its status as a superpower following the Second World War has, along with worldwide broadcasting in English by the BBC[52] and other broadcasters, significantly accelerated the spread of the language across the planet.[53][54] By the 21st century, English was more widely spoken and written than any language has ever been.[55]

A major feature in the early development of Modern English was the codification of explicit norms for standard usage, and their dissemination through official media such as public education and state-sponsored publications. In 1755 Samuel Johnson published his A Dictionary of the English Language which introduced a standard set of spelling conventions and usage norms. In 1828, Noah Webster published the American Dictionary of the English language in an effort to establish a norm for speaking and writing American English that was independent from the British standard. Within Britain, non-standard or lower class dialect features were increasingly stigmatised, leading to the quick spread of the prestige varieties among the middle classes.[56]

In terms of grammatical evolution, Modern English has now reached a stage where the loss of case is almost complete (case is now only found in pronouns, such as he and him, she and her, who and whom), and where SVO word-order is mostly fixed.[56] Some changes, such as the use of do-support have become universalised. (Earlier English did not use the word "do" as a general auxiliary as Modern English does; at first it was only used in question constructions where it was not obligatory.[57] Now, do-support with the verb have is becoming increasingly standardised.) The use of progressive forms in -ing, appears to be spreading to new constructions, and forms such as had been being built are becoming more common. Regularisation of irregular forms also slowly continues (e.g. dreamed instead of dreamt), and analytical alternatives to inflectional forms are becoming more common (e.g. more polite instead of politer). British English is also undergoing change under the influence of American English, fuelled by the strong presence of American English in the media and the prestige associated with the US as a world power.

As of 2016, 400 million people spoke English as their first language, and 1.1 billion spoke it as a secondary language.[61] English is probably the third largest language by number of native speakers, after Mandarin and Spanish.[10] However, when combining native and non-native speakers it may, depending on the estimate used, be the most commonly spoken language in the world.[55][62][63][64] English is spoken by communities on every continent and on oceanic islands in all the major oceans.[65]

The countries in which English is spoken can be grouped into different categories by how English is used in each country. The "inner circle"[66] countries with many native speakers of English share an international standard of written English and jointly influence speech norms of English around the world. English does not belong to just one country, and it does not belong solely to descendants of English settlers. English is an official language of countries populated by few descendants of native speakers of English. It has also become by far the most important language of international communication when people who share no native language meet anywhere in the world.

Three circles of English-speaking countries
Braj Kachru distinguishes countries where English is spoken with a three circles model.[66] In his model, the "inner circle" countries are countries with large communities of native speakers of English, "outer circle" countries have small communities of native speakers of English but widespread use of English as a second language in education or broadcasting or for local official purposes, and "expanding circle" countries are countries where many learners learn English as a foreign language. Kachru bases his model on the history of how English spread in different countries, how users acquire English, and the range of uses English has in each country. The three circles change membership over time.[67]

Braj Kachru's Three Circles of English
Braj Kachru's Three Circles of English.
Countries with large communities of native speakers of English (the inner circle) include Britain, the United States, Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand, where the majority speaks English, and South Africa, where a significant minority speaks English. The countries with the most native English speakers are, in descending order, the United States (at least 231 million),[68] the United Kingdom (60 million),[69][70][71] Canada (19 million),[72] Australia (at least 17 million),[73] South Africa (4.8 million),[74] Ireland (4.2 million), and New Zealand (3.7 million).[75] In these countries, children of native speakers learn English from their parents, and local people who speak other languages or new immigrants learn English to communicate in their neighbourhoods and workplaces.[76] The inner-circle countries provide the base from which English spreads to other countries in the world.[67]

Estimates of the number of English speakers who are second language and foreign-language speakers vary greatly from 470 million to more than 1,000 million depending on how proficiency is defined.[11] Linguist David Crystal estimates that non-native speakers now outnumber native speakers by a ratio of 3 to 1.[62] In Kachru's three-circles model, the "outer circle" countries are countries such as the Philippines,[77] Jamaica,[78] India, Pakistan, Singapore,[79] and Nigeria[80][81] with a much smaller proportion of native speakers of English but much use of English as a second language for education, government, or domestic business, and where English is routinely used for school instruction and official interactions with the government.[82]

Those countries have millions of native speakers of dialect continua ranging from an English-based creole to a more standard version of English. They have many more speakers of English who acquire English in the process of growing up through day by day use and listening to broadcasting, especially if they attend schools where English is the medium of instruction. Varieties of English learned by speakers who are not native speakers born to English-speaking parents may be influenced, especially in their grammar, by the other languages spoken by those learners.[76] Most of those varieties of English include words little used by native speakers of English in the inner-circle countries,[76] and they may have grammatical and phonological differences from inner-circle varieties as well. The standard English of the inner-circle countries is often taken as a norm for use of English in the outer-circle countries.[76]

In the three-circles model, countries such as Poland, China, Brazil, Germany, Japan, Indonesia, Egypt, and other countries where English is taught as a foreign language make up the "expanding circle".[83] The distinctions between English as a first language, as a second language, and as a foreign language are often debatable and may change in particular countries over time.[82] For example, in the Netherlands and some other countries of Europe, knowledge of English as a second language is nearly universal, with over 80 percent of the population able to use it,[84] and thus English is routinely used to communicate with foreigners and often in higher education. In these countries, although English is not used for government business, its widespread use puts them at the boundary between the "outer circle" and "expanding circle". English is unusual among world languages in how many of its users are not native speakers but speakers of English as a second or foreign language.[85]

Many users of English in the expanding circle use it to communicate with other people from the expanding circle, so that interaction with native speakers of English plays no part in their decision to use English.[86] Non-native varieties of English are widely used for international communication, and speakers of one such variety often encounter features of other varieties.[87] Very often today a conversation in English anywhere in the world may include no native speakers of English at all, even while including speakers from several different countries.[88]

Pluricentric English
English is a pluricentric language, which means that no one national authority sets the standard for use of the language.[89][90][91][92] But English is not a divided language,[93] despite a long-standing joke originally attributed to George Bernard Shaw that the United Kingdom and the United States are "two countries separated by a common language".[94] Spoken English, for example English used in broadcasting, generally follows national pronunciation standards that are also established by custom rather than by regulation. International broadcasters are usually identifiable as coming from one country rather than another through their accents,[95] but newsreader scripts are also composed largely in international standard written English. The norms of standard written English are maintained purely by the consensus of educated English-speakers around the world, without any oversight by any government or international organisation.[96]

American listeners generally readily understand most British broadcasting, and British listeners readily understand most American broadcasting. Most English speakers around the world can understand radio programmes, television programmes, and films from many parts of the English-speaking world.[97] Both standard and non-standard varieties of English can include both formal or informal styles, distinguished by word choice and syntax and use both technical and non-technical registers.[98]

The settlement history of the English-speaking inner circle countries outside Britain helped level dialect distinctions and produce koineised forms of English in South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.[99] The majority of immigrants to the United States without British ancestry rapidly adopted English after arrival. Now the majority of the United States population are monolingual English speakers,[100][68] although English has been given official status by only 30 of the 50 state governments of the US.[101][102]

English as a global language
See also: Foreign language influences in English and Study of global communication
English has ceased to be an "English language" in the sense of belonging only to people who are ethnically English.[103][104] Use of English is growing country-by-country internally and for international communication. Most people learn English for practical rather than ideological reasons.[105] Many speakers of English in Africa have become part of an "Afro-Saxon" language community that unites Africans from different countries.[106]

As decolonisation proceeded throughout the British Empire in the 1950s and 1960s, former colonies often did not reject English but rather continued to use it as independent countries setting their own language policies.[50][51][107] For example, the view of the English language among many Indians has gone from associating it with colonialism to associating it with economic progress, and English continues to be an official language of India.[108] English is also widely used in media and literature, and the number of English language books published annually in India is the third largest in the world after the US and UK.[109] However English is rarely spoken as a first language, numbering only around a couple hundred-thousand people, and less than 5% of the population speak fluent English in India.[110][111] David Crystal claimed in 2004 that, combining native and non-native speakers, India now has more people who speak or understand English than any other country in the world,[112] but the number of English speakers in India is very uncertain, with most scholars concluding that the United States still has more speakers of English than India.[113]

Modern English, sometimes described as the first global lingua franca,[53][114] is also regarded as the first world language.[115][116] English is the world's most widely used language in newspaper publishing, book publishing, international telecommunications, scientific publishing, international trade, mass entertainment, and diplomacy.[116] English is, by international treaty, the basis for the required controlled natural languages[117] Seaspeak and Airspeak, used as international languages of seafaring[118] and aviation.[119] English used to have parity with French and German in scientific research, but now it dominates that field.[120] It achieved parity with French as a language of diplomacy at the Treaty of Versailles negotiations in 1919.[121] By the time of the foundation of the United Nations at the end of World War II, English had become pre-eminent [122] and is now the main worldwide language of diplomacy and international relations.[123] It is one of six official languages of the United Nations.[124] Many other worldwide international organisations, including the International Olympic Committee, specify English as a working language or official language of the organisation.

Many regional international organisations such as the European Free Trade Association, Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),[54] and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) set English as their organisation's sole working language even though most members are not countries with a majority of native English speakers. While the European Union (EU) allows member states to designate any of the national languages as an official language of the Union, in practice English is the main working language of EU organisations.[125]

Although in most countries English is not an official language, it is currently the language most often taught as a foreign language.[53][54] In the countries of the EU, English is the most widely spoken foreign language in nineteen of the twenty-five member states where it is not an official language (that is, the countries other than the UK, Ireland and Malta). In a 2012 official Eurobarometer poll, 38 percent of the EU respondents outside the countries where English is an official language said they could speak English well enough to have a conversation in that language. The next most commonly mentioned foreign language, French (which is the most widely known foreign language in the UK and Ireland), could be used in conversation by 12 percent of respondents.[126]

A working knowledge of English has become a requirement in a number of occupations and professions such as medicine[127] and computing. English has become so important in scientific publishing that more than 80 percent of all scientific journal articles indexed by Chemical Abstracts in 1998 were written in English, as were 90 percent of all articles in natural science publications by 1996 and 82 percent of articles in humanities publications by 1995.[128]

Specialised subsets of English arise spontaneously in international communities, for example, among international business people, as an auxiliary language. This has led some scholars to develop the study of English as an auxiliary language. Globish uses a relatively small subset of English vocabulary (about 1500 words with highest use in international business English) in combination with the standard English grammar. Other examples include Simple English.

The increased use of the English language globally has had an effect on other languages, leading to some English words being assimilated into the vocabularies of other languages. This influence of English has led to concerns about language death,[129] and to claims of linguistic imperialism,[130] and has provoked resistance to the spread of English; however the number of speakers continues to increase because many people around the world think that English provides them with opportunities for better employment and improved lives.[131]

Although some scholars mention a possibility of future divergence of English dialects into mutually unintelligible languages, most think a more likely outcome is that English will continue to function as a koineised language in which the standard form unifies speakers from around the world.[132] English is used as the language for wider communication in countries around the world.[133] Thus English has grown in worldwide use much more than any constructed language proposed as an international auxiliary language, including Esperanto.[134][135]

Phonology
Main article: English phonology
The phonetics and phonology of the English language differ from one dialect to another, usually without interfering with mutual communication. Phonological variation affects the inventory of phonemes (i.e. speech sounds that distinguish meaning), and phonetic variation consists in differences in pronunciation of the phonemes. [136] This overview mainly describes the standard pronunciations of the United Kingdom and the United States: Received Pronunciation (RP) and General American (GA) (See Section below on "Dialects, accents and varieties").

The phonetic symbols used below are from the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).[137][138][139]

Consonants
Main article: English phonology § Consonants
Most English dialects share the same 24 consonant phonemes. The consonant inventory shown below is valid for Californian American English,[140] and for RP.[141]

Consonant phonemes
Labial	Dental	Alveolar	Post-
alveolar	Palatal	Velar	Glottal
Nasal		m			n				ŋ	
Stop	p	b		t	d	tʃ	dʒ		k	ɡ	
Fricative	f	v	θ	ð	s	z	ʃ	ʒ			h	
Approximant				l		ɹ*		j		w	
* Conventionally transcribed /r/.

In the table, when obstruents (stops, affricates, and fricatives) appear in pairs, such as /p b/, /tʃ dʒ/, and /s z/, the first is fortis (strong) and the second is lenis (weak). Fortis obstruents, such as /p tʃ s/ are pronounced with more muscular tension and breath force than lenis consonants, such as /b dʒ z/, and are always voiceless. Lenis consonants are partly voiced at the beginning and end of utterances, and fully voiced between vowels. Fortis stops such as /p/ have additional articulatory or acoustic features in most dialects: they are aspirated [pʰ] when they occur alone at the beginning of a stressed syllable, often unaspirated in other cases, and often unreleased [p̚] or pre-glottalised [ʔp] at the end of a syllable. In a single-syllable word, a vowel before a fortis stop is shortened: thus nip has a noticeably shorter vowel (phonetically, but not phonemically) than nib [nɪˑb̥] (see below).[142]

lenis stops: bin [b̥ɪˑn], about [əˈbaʊt], nib [nɪˑb̥]
fortis stops: pin [pʰɪn]; spin [spɪn]; happy [ˈhæpi]; nip [nɪp̚] or [nɪʔp]
In RP, the lateral approximant /l/, has two main allophones (pronunciation variants): the clear or plain [l], as in light, and the dark or velarised [ɫ], as in full.[143] GA has dark l in most cases.[144]

clear l: RP light [laɪt]
dark l: RP and GA full [fʊɫ], GA light [ɫaɪt]
All sonorants (liquids /l, r/ and nasals /m, n, ŋ/) devoice when following a voiceless obstruent, and they are syllabic when following a consonant at the end of a word.[145]

voiceless sonorants: clay [kl̥eɪ̯]; snow RP [sn̥əʊ̯], GA [sn̥oʊ̯]
syllabic sonorants: paddle [ˈpad.l̩], button [ˈbʌt.n̩]
Vowels
Main article: English phonology § Vowels
The pronunciation of vowels varies a great deal between dialects and is one of the most detectable aspects of a speaker's accent. The table below lists the vowel phonemes in Received Pronunciation (RP) and General American (GA), with examples of words in which they occur from lexical sets compiled by linguists. The vowels are represented with symbols from the International Phonetic Alphabet; those given for RP are standard in British dictionaries and other publications.[146]

Monophthongs
RP	GA	Word
iː	i	need
ɪ	bid
e	ɛ	bed
æ	back
ɑː	ɑ	bra
ɒ	box
ɔ, ɑ	cloth
ɔː	paw
uː	u	food
ʊ	good
ʌ	but
ɜː	ɜr	bird
ə	comma
In RP, vowel length is phonemic; long vowels are marked with a triangular colon ⟨ː⟩ in the table above, such as the vowel of need [niːd] as opposed to bid [bɪd]. In GA, vowel length is non-distinctive.

In both RP and GA, vowels are phonetically shortened before fortis consonants in the same syllable, like /t tʃ f/, but not before lenis consonants like /d dʒ v/ or in open syllables: thus, the vowels of rich [rɪtʃ], neat [nit], and safe [seɪ̯f] are noticeably shorter than the vowels of ridge [rɪˑdʒ], need [niˑd], and save [seˑɪ̯v], and the vowel of light [laɪ̯t] is shorter than that of lie [laˑɪ̯]. Because lenis consonants are frequently voiceless at the end of a syllable, vowel length is an important cue as to whether the following consonant is lenis or fortis.[147]

The vowel /ə/ only occurs in unstressed syllables and is closer in quality when followed by a morpheme-internal consonant and opener when morpheme-final or prevocalic.[148][149] Some dialects do not contrast /ɪ/ and /ə/ in unstressed positions, so that rabbit and abbot rhyme and Lenin and Lennon are homophonous, a dialect feature called weak vowel merger.[150] GA /ɜr/ and /ər/ are realised as an r-coloured vowel [ɚ], as in further [ˈfɚðɚ] (phonemically /ˈfɜrðər/, which in RP is realised as [ˈfəːðə] (phonemically /ˈfɜːðə/).[151]

Phonotactics
An English syllable includes a syllable nucleus consisting of a vowel sound. Syllable onset and coda (start and end) are optional. A syllable can start with up to three consonant sounds, as in sprint /sprɪnt/, and end with up to four, as in texts /teksts/. This gives an English syllable the following structure, (CCC)V(CCCC) where C represents a consonant and V a vowel; the word strengths /strɛŋkθs/ is thus an example of the most complex syllable possible in English. The consonants that may appear together in onsets or codas are restricted, as is the order in which they may appear. Onsets can only have four types of consonant clusters: a stop and approximant, as in play; a voiceless fricative and approximant, as in fly or sly; s and a voiceless stop, as in stay; and s, a voiceless stop, and an approximant, as in string.[152] Clusters of nasal and stop are only allowed in codas. Clusters of obstruents always agree invoicing, and clusters of sibilants and of plosives with the same point of articulation are prohibited. Furthermore, several consonants have limited distributions: /h/ can only occur in syllable-initial position, and /ŋ/ only in syllable-final position.[153]

Stress, rhythm and intonation
See also: Stress and vowel reduction in English and Intonation in English
Stress plays an important role in English. Certain syllables are stressed, while others are unstressed. Stress is a combination of duration, intensity, vowel quality, and sometimes changes in pitch. Stressed syllables are pronounced longer and louder than unstressed syllables, and vowels in unstressed syllables are frequently reduced while vowels in stressed syllables are not.[154] Some words, primarily short function words but also some modal verbs such as can, have weak and strong forms depending on whether they occur in stressed or non-stressed position within a sentence.

Stress in English is phonemic, and some pairs of words are distinguished by stress. For instance, the word contract is stressed on the first syllable (/ˈkɒntrækt/ KON-trakt) when used as a noun, but on the last syllable (/kənˈtrækt/ kən-TRAKT) for most meanings (for example, "reduce in size") when used as a verb.[155][156][157] Here stress is connected to vowel reduction: in the noun "contract" the first syllable is stressed and has the unreduced vowel /ɒ/, but in the verb "contract" the first syllable is unstressed and its vowel is reduced to /ə/. Stress is also used to distinguish between words and phrases, so that a compound word receives a single stress unit, but the corresponding phrase has two: e.g. to búrn óut versus a búrnout, and a hótdog versus a hót dóg.[158]

In terms of rhythm, English is generally described as a stress-timed language, meaning that the amount of time between stressed syllables tends to be equal. Stressed syllables are pronounced longer, but unstressed syllables (syllables between stresses) are shortened. Vowels in unstressed syllables are shortened as well, and vowel shortening causes changes in vowel quality: vowel reduction.

Regional variation
Varieties of Standard English and their features[159]
Dialects and low vowels

CLOTH	/ɒ/	lot–cloth split
LOT	/ɑ/	father–bother merger
PALM	/ɑː/
BATH	/æ/	/æ/	trap–bath split
TRAP	/æ/
Varieties of English vary the most in pronunciation of vowels. The best known national varieties used as standards for education in non English-speaking countries are British (BrE) and American (AmE). Countries such as Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and South Africa have their own standard varieties which are less often used as standards for education internationally. Some differences between the various dialects are shown in the table "Varieties of Standard English and their features".[159]

English has undergone many historical sound changes, some of them affecting all varieties, and others affecting only a few. Most standard varieties are affected by the Great Vowel Shift, which changed the pronunciation of long vowels, but a few dialects have slightly different results. In North America, a number of chain shifts such as the Northern Cities Vowel Shift and Canadian Shift have produced very different vowel landscapes in some regional accents.

Some dialects have fewer or more consonant phonemes and phones than the standard varieties. Some conservative varieties like Scottish English have a voiceless [ʍ] sound in whine that contrasts with the voiced [w] in wine, but most other dialects pronounce both words with voiced [w], a dialect feature called wine–whine merger. The unvoiced velar fricative sound /x/ is found in Scottish English, which distinguishes loch /lɔx/ from lock /lɔk/. Accents like Cockney with "h-dropping" lack the glottal fricative /h/, and dialects with th-stopping and th-fronting like African American Vernacular and Estuary English do not have the dental fricatives /θ, ð/, but replace them with dental or alveolar stops /t, d/ or labiodental fricatives /f, v/.[160][161] Other changes affecting the phonology of local varieties are processes such as yod-dropping, yod-coalescence, and reduction of consonant clusters.

General American and Received Pronunciation vary in their pronunciation of historical /r/ after a vowel at the end of a syllable (in the syllable coda). GA is a rhotic dialect, meaning that it pronounces /r/ at the end of a syllable, but RP is non-rhotic, meaning that it loses /r/ in that position. English dialects are classified as rhotic or non-rhotic depending on whether they elide /r/ like RP or keep it like GA.[162]

There is complex dialectal variation in words with the open front and open back vowels /æ ɑː ɒ ɔː/. These four vowels are only distinguished in RP, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. In GA, these vowels merge to three /æ ɑ ɔ/,[163] and in Canadian English, they merge to two /æ ɑ/.[164] In addition, the words that have each vowel vary by dialect. The table "Dialects and open vowels" shows this variation with lexical sets in which these sounds occur.

Grammar
Main article: English grammar
As is typical of an Indo-European language, English follows accusative morphosyntactic alignment. Unlike other Indo-European languages though, English has largely abandoned the inflectional case system in favor of analytic constructions. Only the personal pronouns retain morphological case more strongly than any other word class. English distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, determiners (including articles), prepositions, and conjunctions. Some analyses add pronouns as a class separate from nouns, and subdivide conjunctions into subordinators and coordinators, and add the class of interjections.[165] English also has a rich set of auxiliary verbs, such as have and do, expressing the categories of mood and aspect. Questions are marked by do-support, wh-movement (fronting of question words beginning with wh-) and word order inversion with some verbs.

Some traits typical of Germanic languages persist in English, such as the distinction between irregularly inflected strong stems inflected through ablaut (i.e. changing the vowel of the stem, as in the pairs speak/spoke and foot/feet) and weak stems inflected through affixation (such as love/loved, hand/hands). Vestiges of the case and gender system are found in the pronoun system (he/him, who/whom) and in the inflection of the copula verb to be.

The seven word classes are exemplified in this sample sentence:[166]

The	chairman	of	the	committee	and	the	loquacious	politician	clashed	violently	when	the	meeting	started.
Det.	Noun	Prep.	Det.	Noun	Conj.	Det.	Adj.	Noun	Verb	Advb.	Conj.	Det.	Noun	Verb
Nouns and noun phrases
English nouns are only inflected for number and possession. New nouns can be formed through derivation or compounding. They are semantically divided into proper nouns (names) and common nouns. Common nouns are in turn divided into concrete and abstract nouns, and grammatically into count nouns and mass nouns.[167]

Most count nouns are inflected for plural number through the use of the plural suffix -s, but a few nouns have irregular plural forms. Mass nouns can only be pluralised through the use of a count noun classifier, e.g. one loaf of bread, two loaves of bread.[168]

Regular plural formation:

Singular: cat, dog
Plural: cats, dogs
Irregular plural formation:

Singular: man, woman, foot, fish, ox, knife, mouse
Plural: men, women, feet, fish, oxen, knives, mice
Possession can be expressed either by the possessive enclitic -s (also traditionally called a genitive suffix), or by the preposition of. Historically the -s possessive has been used for animate nouns, whereas the of possessive has been reserved for inanimate nouns. Today this distinction is less clear, and many speakers use -s also with inanimates. Orthographically the possessive -s is separated from the noun root with an apostrophe.

Possessive constructions:

With -s: The woman's husband's child
With of: The child of the husband of the woman
Nouns can form noun phrases (NPs) where they are the syntactic head of the words that depend on them such as determiners, quantifiers, conjunctions or adjectives.[169] Noun phrases can be short, such as the man, composed only of a determiner and a noun. They can also include modifiers such as adjectives (e.g. red, tall, all) and specifiers such as determiners (e.g. the, that). But they can also tie together several nouns into a single long NP, using conjunctions such as and, or prepositions such as with, e.g. the tall man with the long red trousers and his skinny wife with the spectacles (this NP uses conjunctions, prepositions, specifiers, and modifiers). Regardless of length, an NP functions as a syntactic unit. For example, the possessive enclitic can, in cases which do not lead to ambiguity, follow the entire noun phrase, as in The President of India's wife, where the enclitic follows India and not President.

The class of determiners is used to specify the noun they precede in terms of definiteness, where the marks a definite noun and a or an an indefinite one. A definite noun is assumed by the speaker to be already known by the interlocutor, whereas an indefinite noun is not specified as being previously known. Quantifiers, which include one, many, some and all, are used to specify the noun in terms of quantity or number. The noun must agree with the number of the determiner, e.g. one man (sg.) but all men (pl.). Determiners are the first constituents in a noun phrase.[170]

Adjectives
Adjectives modify a noun by providing additional information about their referents. In English, adjectives come before the nouns they modify and after determiners.[171] In Modern English, adjectives are not inflected, and they do not agree in form with the noun they modify, as adjectives in most other Indo-European languages do. For example, in the phrases the slender boy, and many slender girls, the adjective slender does not change form to agree with either the number or gender of the noun.

Some adjectives are inflected for degree of comparison, with the positive degree unmarked, the suffix -er marking the comparative, and -est marking the superlative: a small boy, the boy is smaller than the girl, that boy is the smallest. Some adjectives have irregular comparative and superlative forms, such as good, better, and best. Other adjectives have comparatives formed by periphrastic constructions, with the adverb more marking the comparative, and most marking the superlative: happier or more happy, the happiest or most happy.[172] There is some variation among speakers regarding which adjectives use inflected or periphrastic comparison, and some studies have shown a tendency for the periphrastic forms to become more common at the expense of the inflected form.[173]

Pronouns, case, and person
English pronouns conserve many traits of case and gender inflection. The personal pronouns retain a difference between subjective and objective case in most persons (I/me, he/him, she/her, we/us, they/them) as well as a gender and animateness distinction in the third person singular (distinguishing he/she/it). The subjective case corresponds to the Old English nominative case, and the objective case is used both in the sense of the previous accusative case (in the role of patient, or direct object of a transitive verb), and in the sense of the Old English dative case (in the role of a recipient or indirect object of a transitive verb).[174][175] Subjective case is used when the pronoun is the subject of a finite clause, and otherwise, the objective case is used.[176] While grammarians such as Henry Sweet[177] and Otto Jespersen[178] noted that the English cases did not correspond to the traditional Latin based system, some contemporary grammars, for example Huddleston & Pullum (2002), retain traditional labels for the cases, calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively.

Possessive pronouns exist in dependent and independent forms; the dependent form functions as a determiner specifying a noun (as in my chair), while the independent form can stand alone as if it were a noun (e.g. the chair is mine).[179] The English system of grammatical person no longer has a distinction between formal and informal pronouns of address (the old 2nd person singular familiar pronoun thou acquired a pejorative or inferior tinge of meaning and was abandoned), and the forms for 2nd person plural and singular are identical except in the reflexive form. Some dialects have introduced innovative 2nd person plural pronouns such as y'all found in Southern American English and African American (Vernacular) English or youse and ye found in Irish English.

English personal pronouns
Person	Subjective case	Objective case	Dependent possessive	Independent possessive	Reflexive
1st p. sg.	I	me	my	mine	myself
2nd p. sg.	you	you	your	yours	yourself
3rd p. sg.	he/she/it	him/her/it	his/her/its	his/hers/its	himself/herself/itself
1st p. pl.	we	us	our	ours	ourselves
2nd p. pl.	you	you	your	yours	yourselves
3rd p. pl	they	them	their	theirs	themselves
Pronouns are used to refer to entities deictically or anaphorically. A deictic pronoun points to some person or object by identifying it relative to the speech situation — for example, the pronoun I identifies the speaker, and the pronoun you, the addressee. Anaphorical pronouns such as that refer back to an entity already mentioned or assumed by the speaker to be known by the audience, for example in the sentence I already told you that. The reflexive pronouns are used when the oblique argument is identical to the subject of a phrase (e.g. "he sent it to himself" or "she braced herself for impact").[180]

Prepositions
Prepositional phrases (PP) are phrases composed of a preposition and one or more nouns, e.g. with the dog, for my friend, to school, in England. Prepositions have a wide range of uses in English. They are used to describe movement, place, and other relations between different entities, but they also have many syntactic uses such as introducing complement clauses and oblique arguments of verbs. For example, in the phrase I gave it to him, the preposition to marks the recipient, or Indirect Object of the verb to give. Traditionally words were only considered prepositions if they governed the case of the noun they preceded, for example causing the pronouns to use the objective rather than subjective form, "with her", "to me", "for us". But some contemporary grammars such as that of Huddleston & Pullum (2002:598–600) no longer consider government of case to be the defining feature of the class of prepositions, rather defining prepositions as words that can function as the heads of prepositional phrases.

Verbs and verb phrases
English verbs are inflected for tense and aspect and marked for agreement with third person singular subject. Only the copula verb to be is still inflected for agreement with the plural and first and second person subjects.[172] Auxiliary verbs such as have and be are paired with verbs in the infinitive, past, or progressive forms. They form complex tenses, aspects, and moods. Auxiliary verbs differ from other verbs in that they can be followed by the negation, and in that they can occur as the first constituent in a question sentence.[181][182]

Most verbs have six inflectional forms. The primary forms are a plain present, a third person singular present, and a preterite (past) form. The secondary forms are a plain form used for the infinitive, a gerund-participle and a past participle.[183] The copula verb to be is the only verb to retain some of its original conjugation, and takes different inflectional forms depending on the subject. The first person present tense form is am, the third person singular form is and the form are is used second person singular and all three plurals. The only verb past participle is been and its gerund-participle is being.

English inflectional forms
Inflection	Strong	Regular
Plain present	take	love
3rd person sg.
present	takes	loves
Preterite	took	loved
Plain (infinitive)	take	love
Gerund–participle	taking	loving
Past participle	taken	loved
Tense, aspect and mood
English has two primary tenses, past (preterit) and non-past. The preterit is inflected by using the preterit form of the verb, which for the regular verbs includes the suffix -ed, and for the strong verbs either the suffix -t or a change in the stem vowel. The non-past form is unmarked except in the third person singular, which takes the suffix -s.[181]

Present	Preterite
First person	I run	I ran
Second person	You run	You ran
Third person	John runs	John ran
English does not have a morphologised future tense.[184] Futurity of action is expressed periphrastically with one of the auxiliary verbs will or shall.[185] Many varieties also use a near future constructed with the phrasal verb be going to.[186]

Future
First person	I will run
Second person	You will run
Third person	John will run
Further aspectual distinctions are encoded by the use of auxiliary verbs, primarily have and be, which encode the contrast between a perfect and non-perfect past tense (I have run vs. I was running), and compound tenses such as preterite perfect (I had been running) and present perfect (I have been running).[187]

For the expression of mood, English uses a number of modal auxiliaries, such as can, may, will, shall and the past tense forms could, might, would, should. There is also a subjunctive and an imperative mood, both based on the plain form of the verb (i.e. without the third person singular -s), and which is used in subordinate clauses (e.g. subjunctive: It is important that he run every day; imperative Run!).[185]

An infinitive form, that uses the plain form of the verb and the preposition to, is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause. Finite verbal clauses are those that are formed around a verb in the present or preterit form. In clauses with auxiliary verbs, they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause. For example, he has to go where only the auxiliary verb have is inflected for time and the main verb to go is in the infinitive, or in a complement clause such as I saw him leave, where the main verb is to see which is in a preterite form, and leave is in the infinitive.

Phrasal verbs
English also makes frequent use of constructions traditionally called phrasal verbs, verb phrases that are made up of a verb root and a preposition or particle which follows the verb. The phrase then functions as a single predicate. In terms of intonation the preposition is fused to the verb, but in writing it is written as a separate word. Examples of phrasal verbs are to get up, to ask out, to back up, to give up, to get together, to hang out, to put up with, etc. The phrasal verb frequently has a highly idiomatic meaning that is more specialised and restricted than what can be simply extrapolated from the combination of verb and preposition complement (e.g. lay off meaning terminate someone's employment).[188] In spite of the idiomatic meaning, some grammarians, including Huddleston & Pullum (2002:274), do not consider this type of construction to form a syntactic constituent and hence refrain from using the term "phrasal verb". Instead, they consider the construction simply to be a verb with a prepositional phrase as its syntactic complement, i.e. he woke up in the morning and he ran up in the mountains are syntactically equivalent.

Adverbs
The function of adverbs is to modify the action or event described by the verb by providing additional information about the manner in which it occurs. Many adverbs are derived from adjectives with the suffix -ly, but not all, and many speakers tend to omit the suffix in the most commonly used adverbs. For example, in the phrase the woman walked quickly the adverb quickly derived from the adjective quick describes the woman's way of walking. Some commonly used adjectives have irregular adverbial forms, such as good which has the adverbial form well.

Syntax

In the English sentence The cat sat on the mat, the subject is the cat (a NP), the verb is sat, and on the mat is a prepositional phrase (composed of an NP the mat, and headed by the preposition on). The tree describes the structure of the sentence.
Modern English syntax language is moderately analytic.[189] It has developed features such as modal verbs and word order as resources for conveying meaning. Auxiliary verbs mark constructions such as questions, negative polarity, the passive voice and progressive aspect.

Basic constituent order
English word order has moved from the Germanic verb-second (V2) word order to being almost exclusively subject–verb–object (SVO).[190] The combination of SVO order and use of auxiliary verbs often creates clusters of two or more verbs at the centre of the sentence, such as he had hoped to try to open it.

In most sentences, English only marks grammatical relations through word order.[191] The subject constituent precedes the verb and the object constituent follows it. The example below demonstrates how the grammatical roles of each constituent is marked only by the position relative to the verb:

The dog	bites	the man
S	V	O
The man	bites	the dog
S	V	O
An exception is found in sentences where one of the constituents is a pronoun, in which case it is doubly marked, both by word order and by case inflection, where the subject pronoun precedes the verb and takes the subjective case form, and the object pronoun follows the verb and takes the objective case form. The example below demonstrates this double marking in a sentence where both object and subject is represented with a third person singular masculine pronoun:

He	hit	him
S	V	O
Indirect objects (IO) of ditransitive verbs can be placed either as the first object in a double object construction (S V IO O), such as I gave Jane the book or in a prepositional phrase, such as I gave the book to Jane [192]

Clause syntax
Main article: English clause syntax
In English a sentence may be composed of one or more clauses, that may, in turn, be composed of one or more phrases (e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases). A clause is built around a verb and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within a sentence, one clause is always the main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are subordinate to it. Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example, in the phrase I think (that) you are lying, the main clause is headed by the verb think, the subject is I, but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause (that) you are lying. The subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause, but it is often omitted.[193] Relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence I saw the letter that you received today, the relative clause that you received today specifies the meaning of the word letter, the object of the main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who, whose, whom and which as well as by that (which can also be omitted.)[194] In contrast to many other Germanic languages there is no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.[195]

Auxiliary verb constructions
Main articles: Do-support and Subject–auxiliary inversion
English syntax relies on auxiliary verbs for many functions including the expression of tense, aspect, and mood. Auxiliary verbs form main clauses, and the main verbs function as heads of a subordinate clause of the auxiliary verb. For example, in the sentence the dog did not find its bone, the clause find its bone is the complement of the negated verb did not. Subject–auxiliary inversion is used in many constructions, including focus, negation, and interrogative constructions.

The verb do can be used as an auxiliary even in simple declarative sentences, where it usually serves to add emphasis, as in "I did shut the fridge." However, in the negated and inverted clauses referred to above, it is used because the rules of English syntax permit these constructions only when an auxiliary is present. Modern English does not allow the addition of the negating adverb not to an ordinary finite lexical verb, as in *I know not—it can only be added to an auxiliary (or copular) verb, hence if there is no other auxiliary present when negation is required, the auxiliary do is used, to produce a form like I do not (don't) know. The same applies in clauses requiring inversion, including most questions—inversion must involve the subject and an auxiliary verb, so it is not possible to say *Know you him?; grammatical rules require Do you know him?[196]

Negation is done with the adverb not, which precedes the main verb and follows an auxiliary verb. A contracted form of not -n't can be used as an enclitic attaching to auxiliary verbs and to the copula verb to be. Just as with questions, many negative constructions require the negation to occur with do-support, thus in Modern English I don't know him is the correct answer to the question Do you know him?, but not *I know him not, although this construction may be found in older English.[197]

Passive constructions also use auxiliary verbs. A passive construction rephrases an active construction in such a way that the object of the active phrase becomes the subject of the passive phrase, and the subject of the active phrase is either omitted or demoted to a role as an oblique argument introduced in a prepositional phrase. They are formed by using the past participle either with the auxiliary verb to be or to get, although not all varieties of English allow the use of passives with get. For example, putting the sentence she sees him into the passive becomes he is seen (by her), or he gets seen (by her).[198]

Questions
Both yes–no questions and wh-questions in English are mostly formed using subject–auxiliary inversion (Am I going tomorrow?, Where can we eat?), which may require do-support (Do you like her?, Where did he go?). In most cases, interrogative words (wh-words; e.g. what, who, where, when, why, how) appear in a fronted position. For example, in the question What did you see?, the word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence. (When the wh-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs: Who saw the cat?.) Prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the question's theme, e.g. To whose house did you go last night?. The personal interrogative pronoun who is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case, with the variant whom serving as the objective case form, although this form may be going out of use in many contexts.[199]

Discourse level syntax
While English is a subject-prominent language, at the discourse level it tends to use a topic-comment structure, where the known information (topic) precedes the new information (comment). Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic of a sentence generally has to be the grammatical subject of the sentence. In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence, frequently the topic is promoted to subject position through syntactic means. One way of doing this is through a passive construction, the girl was stung by the bee. Another way is through a cleft sentence where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject such as it or there, e.g. it was the girl that the bee stung, there was a girl who was stung by a bee.[200] Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs (e.g., it is raining) or in existential clauses (there are many cars on the street). Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic-comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax.

Focus constructions emphasise a particular piece of new or salient information within a sentence, generally through allocating the main sentence level stress on the focal constituent. For example, the girl was stung by a bee (emphasising it was a bee and not, for example, a wasp that stung her), or The girl was stung by a bee (contrasting with another possibility, for example that it was the boy).[201] Topic and focus can also be established through syntactic dislocation, either preposing or postposing the item to be focused on relative to the main clause. For example, That girl over there, she was stung by a bee, emphasises the girl by preposition, but a similar effect could be achieved by postposition, she was stung by a bee, that girl over there, where reference to the girl is established as an "afterthought".[202]

Cohesion between sentences is achieved through the use of deictic pronouns as anaphora (e.g. that is exactly what I mean where that refers to some fact known to both interlocutors, or then used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated event).[203] Discourse markers such as oh, so or well, also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion. Discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences. Discourse markers are also used for stance taking in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said, for example, no way is that true! (the idiomatic marker no way! expressing disbelief), or boy! I'm hungry (the marker boy expressing emphasis). While discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of English, they are also used in written and formal registers.[204]

Vocabulary
English is a rich language in terms of vocabulary, containing more synonyms than any other language.[130] There are words which appear on the surface to mean exactly the same thing but which, in fact, have slightly different shades of meaning and must be chosen appropriately if a speaker wants to convey precisely the message intended. It is generally stated that English has around 170,000 words, or 220,000 if obsolete words are counted; this estimate is based on the last full edition of the Oxford English Dictionary from 1989.[205] Over half of these words are nouns, a quarter adjectives, and a seventh verbs. There is one count that puts the English vocabulary at about 1 million words – but that count presumably includes words such as Latin species names, scientific terminology, botanical terms, prefixed and suffixed words, jargon, foreign words of extremely limited English use, and technical acronyms.[13]

Due to its status as an international language, English adopts foreign words quickly, and borrows vocabulary from many other sources. Early studies of English vocabulary by lexicographers, the scholars who formally study vocabulary, compile dictionaries, or both, were impeded by a lack of comprehensive data on actual vocabulary in use from good-quality linguistic corpora,[206] collections of actual written texts and spoken passages. Many statements published before the end of the 20th century about the growth of English vocabulary over time, the dates of first use of various words in English, and the sources of English vocabulary will have to be corrected as new computerised analysis of linguistic corpus data becomes available.[13][207]

Word formation processes
English forms new words from existing words or roots in its vocabulary through a variety of processes. One of the most productive processes in English is conversion,[208] using a word with a different grammatical role, for example using a noun as a verb or a verb as a noun. Another productive word-formation process is nominal compounding,[13][207] producing compound words such as babysitter or ice cream or homesick.[208] A process more common in Old English than in Modern English, but still productive in Modern English, is the use of derivational suffixes (-hood, -ness, -ing, -ility) to derive new words from existing words (especially those of Germanic origin) or stems (especially for words of Latin or Greek origin).

Formation of new words, called neologisms, based on Greek and/or Latin roots (for example television or optometry) is a highly productive process in English and in most modern European languages, so much so that it is often difficult to determine in which language a neologism originated. For this reason, lexicographer Philip Gove attributed many such words to the "international scientific vocabulary" (ISV) when compiling Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1961). Another active word-formation process in English is acronyms,[209] words formed by pronouncing as a single word abbreviations of longer phrases (e.g. NATO, laser).

Word origins
Main article: Lists of English loanwords by country or language of origin

Source languages of English vocabulary[6][210]
English, besides forming new words from existing words and their roots, also borrows words from other languages. This adoption of words from other languages is commonplace in many world languages, but English has been especially open to borrowing of foreign words throughout the last 1,000 years.[211] The most commonly used words in English are West Germanic.[212] The words in English learned first by children as they learn to speak, particularly the grammatical words that dominate the word count of both spoken and written texts, are mainly the Germanic words inherited from the earliest periods of the development of Old English.[13]

But one of the consequences of long language contact between French and English in all stages of their development is that the vocabulary of English has a very high percentage of "Latinate" words (derived from French, especially, and also from Latin and other Romance languages). French words from various periods of the development of French now make up one-third of the vocabulary of English.[213] Words of Old Norse origin have entered the English language primarily from the contact between Old Norse and Old English during colonisation of eastern and northern England. Many of these words are part of English core vocabulary, such as egg and knife.[214]

English has also borrowed many words directly from Latin, the ancestor of the Romance languages, during all stages of its development.[207][13] Many of these words had earlier been borrowed into Latin from Greek. Latin or Greek are still highly productive sources of stems used to form vocabulary of subjects learned in higher education such as the sciences, philosophy, and mathematics.[215] English continues to gain new loanwords and calques ("loan translations") from languages all over the world, and words from languages other than the ancestral Anglo-Saxon language make up about 60% of the vocabulary of English.[216]

English has formal and informal speech registers; informal registers, including child-directed speech, tend to be made up predominantly of words of Anglo-Saxon origin, while the percentage of vocabulary that is of Latinate origin is higher in legal, scientific, and academic texts.[217][218]

English loanwords and calques in other languages
English has a strong influence on the vocabulary of other languages.[213][219] The influence of English comes from such factors as opinion leaders in other countries knowing the English language, the role of English as a world lingua franca, and the large number of books and films that are translated from English into other languages.[220] That pervasive use of English leads to a conclusion in many places that English is an especially suitable language for expressing new ideas or describing new technologies. Among varieties of English, it is especially American English that influences other languages.[221] Some languages, such as Chinese, write words borrowed from English mostly as calques, while others, such as Japanese, readily take in English loanwords written in sound-indicating script.[222] Dubbed films and television programmes are an especially fruitful source of English influence on languages in Europe.[222]

Writing system
See also: English alphabet, English braille, and English orthography
Since the ninth century, English has been written in a Latin alphabet (also called Roman alphabet). Earlier Old English texts in Anglo-Saxon runes are only short inscriptions. The great majority of literary works in Old English that survive to today are written in the Roman alphabet.[32] The modern English alphabet contains 26 letters of the Latin script: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z (which also have capital forms: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

The spelling system, or orthography, of English is multi-layered, with elements of French, Latin, and Greek spelling on top of the native Germanic system.[223] Further complications have arisen through sound changes with which the orthography has not kept pace.[44] Compared to European languages for which official organisations have promoted spelling reforms, English has spelling that is a less consistent indicator of pronunciation, and standard spellings of words that are more difficult to guess from knowing how a word is pronounced.[224] There are also systematic spelling differences between British and American English. These situations have prompted proposals for spelling reform in English.[225]

Although letters and speech sounds do not have a one-to-one correspondence in standard English spelling, spelling rules that take into account syllable structure, phonetic changes in derived words, and word accent are reliable for most English words.[226] Moreover, standard English spelling shows etymological relationships between related words that would be obscured by a closer correspondence between pronunciation and spelling, for example the words photograph, photography, and photographic,[226] or the words electricity and electrical. While few scholars agree with Chomsky and Halle (1968) that conventional English orthography is "near-optimal",[223] there is a rationale for current English spelling patterns.[227] The standard orthography of English is the most widely used writing system in the world.[228] Standard English spelling is based on a graphomorphemic segmentation of words into written clues of what meaningful units make up each word.[229]

Readers of English can generally rely on the correspondence between spelling and pronunciation to be fairly regular for letters or digraphs used to spell consonant sounds. The letters b, d, f, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, w, y, z represent, respectively, the phonemes /b, d, f, h, dʒ, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, w, j, z/. The letters c and g normally represent /k/ and /ɡ/, but there is also a soft c pronounced /s/, and a soft g pronounced /dʒ/. The differences in the pronunciations of the letters c and g are often signalled by the following letters in standard English spelling. Digraphs used to represent phonemes and phoneme sequences include ch for /tʃ/, sh for /ʃ/, th for /θ/ or /ð/, ng for /ŋ/, qu for /kw/, and ph for /f/ in Greek-derived words. The single letter x is generally pronounced as /z/ in word-initial position and as /ks/ otherwise. There are exceptions to these generalisations, often the result of loanwords being spelled according to the spelling patterns of their languages of origin[226] or proposals by pedantic scholars in the early period of Modern English to mistakenly follow the spelling patterns of Latin for English words of Germanic origin.[230]

For the vowel sounds of the English language, however, correspondences between spelling and pronunciation are more irregular. There are many more vowel phonemes in English than there are single vowel letters (a, e, i, o, u, w, y). As a result, some "long vowels" are often indicated by combinations of letters (like the oa in boat, the ow in how, and the ay in stay), or the historically based silent e (as in note and cake).[227]

The consequence of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read can be challenging in English. It can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of English than of many other languages, including Italian, Spanish, and German.[231] Nonetheless, there is an advantage for learners of English reading in learning the specific sound-symbol regularities that occur in the standard English spellings of commonly used words.[226] Such instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in English.[232][233] Making primary school teachers more aware of the primacy of morpheme representation in English may help learners learn more efficiently to read and write English.[234]

English writing also includes a system of punctuation marks that is similar to those used in most alphabetic languages around the world. The purpose of punctuation is to mark meaningful grammatical relationships in sentences to aid readers in understanding a text and to indicate features important for reading a text aloud.[235]

Dialects, accents, and varieties
Main articles: List of dialects of the English language, World Englishes, and regional accents of English
Dialectologists identify many English dialects, which usually refer to regional varieties that differ from each other in terms of patterns of grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. The pronunciation of particular areas distinguishes dialects as separate regional accents. The major native dialects of English are often divided by linguists into the two extremely general categories of British English (BrE) and North American English (NAE).[236] There also exists a third common major grouping of English varieties: Southern Hemisphere English, the most prominent being Australian and New Zealand English.

Map showing the main dialect regions in the UK and Ireland
As the place where English first evolved, the British Isles, and particularly England, are home to the most diverse dialects. Within the United Kingdom, the Received Pronunciation (RP), an educated dialect of South East England, is traditionally used as the broadcast standard and is considered the most prestigious of the British dialects. The spread of RP (also known as BBC English) through the media has caused many traditional dialects of rural England to recede, as youths adopt the traits of the prestige variety instead of traits from local dialects. At the time of the Survey of English Dialects, grammar and vocabulary differed across the country, but a process of lexical attrition has led most of this variation to disappear.[237]

Nonetheless this attrition has mostly affected dialectal variation in grammar and vocabulary, and in fact, only 3 percent of the English population actually speak RP, the remainder speaking regional accents and dialects with varying degrees of RP influence.[238] There is also variability within RP, particularly along class lines between Upper and Middle-class RP speakers and between native RP speakers and speakers who adopt RP later in life.[239] Within Britain, there is also considerable variation along lines of social class, and some traits though exceedingly common are considered "non-standard" and are associated with lower class speakers and identities. An example of this is H-dropping, which was historically a feature of lower-class London English, particularly Cockney, and can now be heard in the local accents of most parts of England — yet it remains largely absent in broadcasting and among the upper crust of British society.[240]

English in England can be divided into four major dialect regions, Southwest English, South East English, Midlands English, and Northern English. Within each of these regions several local subdialects exist: Within the Northern region, there is a division between the Yorkshire dialects, and the Geordie dialect spoken in Northumbria around Newcastle, and the Lancashire dialects with local urban dialects in Liverpool (Scouse) and Manchester (Mancunian). Having been the centre of Danish occupation during the Viking Invasions, Northern English dialects, particularly the Yorkshire dialect, retain Norse features not found in other English varieties.[241]

Since the 15th century, southeastern England varieties centred around London, which has been the centre from which dialectal innovations have spread to other dialects. In London, the Cockney dialect was traditionally used by the lower classes, and it was long a socially stigmatised variety. The spread of Cockney features across the south-east led the media to talk of Estuary English as a new dialect, but the notion was criticised by many linguists on the grounds that London had influencing neighbouring regions throughout history.[242][243][244] Traits that have spread from London in recent decades include the use of intrusive R (drawing is pronounced drawring /ˈdrɔːrɪŋ/), t-glottalisation (Potter is pronounced with a glottal stop as Po'er /poʔʌ/), and the pronunciation of th- as /f/ (thanks pronounced fanks) or /v/ (bother pronounced bover). [245]

Scots is today considered a separate language from English, but it has its origins in early Northern Middle English[246] and developed and changed during its history with influence from other sources, particularly Scots Gaelic and Old Norse. Scots itself has a number of regional dialects. And in addition to Scots, Scottish English are the varieties of Standard English spoken in Scotland, most varieties are Northern English accents, with some influence from Scots.[247]

In Ireland, various forms of English have been spoken since the Norman invasions of the 11th century. In County Wexford, in the area surrounding Dublin, two extinct dialects known as Forth and Bargy and Fingallian developed as offshoots from Early Middle English, and were spoken until the 19th century. Modern Irish English, however, has its roots in English colonisation in the 17th century. Today Irish English is divided into Ulster English, the Northern Ireland dialect with strong influence from Scots, as well as various dialects of the Republic of Ireland. Like Scottish and most North American accents, almost all Irish accents preserve the rhoticity which has been lost in the dialects influenced by RP.[19][248]

Rhoticity dominates in North American English. The Atlas of North American English found over 50% non-rhoticity, though, in at least one local white speaker in each U.S. metropolitan area designated here by a red dot. Non-rhotic African American Vernacular English pronunciations may be found among African Americans regardless of location.
North American English is fairly homogeneous compared to British English. Today, American accent variation is often increasing at the regional level and decreasing at the very local level,[249] though most Americans still speak within a phonological continuum of similar accents,[250] known collectively as General American (GA), with differences hardly noticed even among Americans themselves (such as Midland and Western American English).[251][252][253] In most American and Canadian English dialects, rhoticity (or r-fulness) is dominant, with non-rhoticity (r-dropping) becoming associated with lower prestige and social class especially after World War II; this contrasts with the situation in England, where non-rhoticity has become the standard.[254]

Separate from GA are American dialects with clearly distinct sound systems, historically including Southern American English, English of the coastal Northeast (famously including Eastern New England English and New York City English), and African American Vernacular English, all of which are historically non-rhotic. Canadian English, except for the Atlantic provinces and perhaps Quebec, may be classified under GA as well, but it often shows the raising of the vowels /aɪ/ and /aʊ/ before voiceless consonants, as well as distinct norms for written and pronunciation standards.[255]

In Southern American English, the most populous American "accent group" outside of GA,[256] rhoticity now strongly prevails, replacing the region's historical non-rhotic prestige.[257][258][259] Southern accents are colloquially described as a "drawl" or "twang,"[260] being recognised most readily by the Southern Vowel Shift initiated by glide-deleting in the /aɪ/ vowel (e.g. pronouncing spy almost like spa), the "Southern breaking" of several front pure vowels into a gliding vowel or even two syllables (e.g. pronouncing the word "press" almost like "pray-us"),[261] the pin–pen merger, and other distinctive phonological, grammatical, and lexical features, many of which are actually recent developments of the 19th century or later.[262]

Today spoken primarily by working- and middle-class African Americans, African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) is also largely non-rhotic and likely originated among enslaved Africans and African Americans influenced primarily by the non-rhotic, non-standard older Southern dialects. A minority of linguists,[263] contrarily, propose that AAVE mostly traces back to African languages spoken by the slaves who had to develop a pidgin or Creole English to communicate with slaves of other ethnic and linguistic origins.[264] AAVE's important commonalities with Southern accents suggests it developed into a highly coherent and homogeneous variety in the 19th or early 20th century. AAVE is commonly stigmatised in North America as a form of "broken" or "uneducated" English, as are white Southern accents, but linguists today recognise both as fully developed varieties of English with their own norms shared by a large speech community.[265][266]

Since 1788, English has been spoken in Oceania, and Australian English has developed as a first language of the vast majority of the inhabitants of the Australian continent, its standard accent being General Australian. The English of neighbouring New Zealand has to a lesser degree become an influential standard variety of the language.[267] Australian and New Zealand English are each other's closest relatives with few differentiating characteristics, followed by South African English and the English of southeastern England, all of which have similarly non-rhotic accents, aside from some accents in the South Island of New Zealand. Australian and New Zealand English stand out for their innovative vowels: many short vowels are fronted or raised, whereas many long vowels have diphthongised. Australian English also has a contrast between long and short vowels, not found in most other varieties. Australian English grammar aligns closely to British and American English; like American English, collective plural subjects take on a singular verb (as in the government is rather than are).[268][269] New Zealand English uses front vowels that are often even higher than in Australian English.[270][271][272]

English is spoken widely in South Africa and is an official or co-official language in several countries. In South Africa, English has been spoken since 1820, co-existing with Afrikaans and various African languages such as the Khoe and Bantu languages. Today about 9 percent of the South African population speak South African English (SAE) as a first language. SAE is a non-rhotic variety, which tends to follow RP as a norm. It is alone among non-rhotic varieties in lacking intrusive r. There are different L2 varieties that differ based on the native language of the speakers.[273] Most phonological differences from RP are in the vowels.[274] Consonant differences include the tendency to pronounce /p, t, t͡ʃ, k/ without aspiration (e.g. pin pronounced [pɪn] rather than as [pʰɪn] as in most other varieties), while r is often pronounced as a flap [ɾ] instead of as the more common fricative.[275]

Nigerian English is a dialect of English spoken in Nigeria.[276] It is based on British English, but in recent years, because of influence from the United States, some words of American English origin have made it into Nigerian English. Additionally, some new words and collocations have emerged from the language, which come from the need to express concepts specific to the culture of the nation (e.g. senior wife). Over 150 million population of Nigerians speak English.[277]

Several varieties of English are also spoken in the Caribbean Islands that were colonial possessions of Britain, including Jamaica, and the Leeward and Windward Islands and Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, the Cayman Islands, and Belize. Each of these areas are home both to a local variety of English and a local English based creole, combining English and African languages. The most prominent varieties are Jamaican English and Jamaican Creole. In Central America, English based creoles are spoken in on the Caribbean coasts of Nicaragua and Panama.[278] Locals are often fluent both in the local English variety and the local creole languages and code-switching between them is frequent, indeed another way to conceptualise the relationship between Creole and Standard varieties is to see a spectrum of social registers with the Creole forms serving as "basilect" and the more RP-like forms serving as the "acrolect", the most formal register.[279]

Most Caribbean varieties are based on British English and consequently, most are non-rhotic, except for formal styles of Jamaican English which are often rhotic. Jamaican English differs from RP in its vowel inventory, which has a distinction between long and short vowels rather than tense and lax vowels as in Standard English. The diphthongs /ei/ and /ou/ are monophthongs [eː] and [oː] or even the reverse diphthongs [ie] and [uo] (e.g. bay and boat pronounced [bʲeː] and [bʷoːt]). Often word-final consonant clusters are simplified so that "child" is pronounced [t͡ʃail] and "wind" [win].[280][281][282]

As a historical legacy, Indian English tends to take RP as its ideal, and how well this ideal is realised in an individual's speech reflects class distinctions among Indian English speakers. Indian English accents are marked by the pronunciation of phonemes such as /t/ and /d/ (often pronounced with retroflex articulation as [ʈ] and [ɖ]) and the replacement of /θ/ and /ð/ with dentals [t̪] and [d̪]. Sometimes Indian English speakers may also use spelling based pronunciations where the silent ⟨h⟩ found in words such as ghost is pronounced as an Indian voiced aspirated stop [ɡʱ].[283]

By
Jung Chang
Copyright Glohalflair Ltd 1991

Winner of the 1992 NCR Book Award and the 1993 British Book of the Year Award.

To my grandmother and my father who did not live to see this book

Jung Chang was born in Yibin, Sichuan Province, China, in 1952.  She was a Red Guard briefly at the age of fourteen and then worked as a peasant, a 'barefoot doctor," a steelworker, and an electrician before becoming an English-language student and, later, an assistant lecturer at Sichuan University.  She left China for Britain in 1978 and was subsequently awarded a scholarship by York University, where she obtained a PhD in Linguistics the first person from the People's Republic of China to receive a doctorate from a British university. Jung Chang lives in London and teaches at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London University.


AUTHOR'S NOTE
My name "Jung' is pronounced "Yung."
The names of members of my family and public figures are real, and are spelled in the way by which they are usually known.  Other personal names are disguised.
Two difficult phonetic symbols: X and Q are pronounced, respectively, as sh and ch In order to describe their functions accurately, I have translated the names of some Chinese organizations differently from the Chinese official versions.  I use 'the Department of Public Affairs' rather than 'the Department of Propaganda' for xuan-chuan-bu, and 'the Cultural Revolution Authority' rather than 'the Cultural Revolution Group' for zhong-yang-wen-ge.

Jon Halliday has helped me create Wild Swans.  Of his many
contributions, polishing my English was only the most obvious.

Through our daily discussions, he forced me into greater clarification
of both the stories and my thoughts, and helped me search the English
language for the exact expressions.  I felt safer under his historian's
knowledgeable and meticulous scrutiny, and relied on his sound
judgment.

Toby Eady is the best agent anyone could possibly hope for.  He helped
push me, gently, into taking up the pen in the first place.

I feel privileged to be associated with such outstanding professionals
as Alice Mayhew, Charles Hayward, Jack McKeown and Victoria Meyer at
Simon & Schuster in New York and Simon King, Carol O'Brien and Helen
Ellis at HarperCollins in London.

To Alice Mayhew, my editor at Simon & Schuster, I owe special gratitude
for her insightful comments and invaluable dynamism.

Robert Lacey at HarperCollins did a superb job editing the manuscript,
for which I am deeply indebted.  Ari Hoogenboom's efficiency and warmth
on the transatlantic phone have been energizing.  I am also thankful to
all those who have worked on this book.

The enthusiastic interest of my friends has been a perpetual source of
encouragement.  To all of them I am most grateful.  I have received
particular help from Peter Whitaker, I Fu En, Emma Termant, Gavan
McCormack, Herbert Bix, R. G. Tiedemann, Hugh Baker, YanJiaqi, Su
Li-qun, Y. H. Zhao, Michael Fu, John Chow, Clare Peploe, Andri Deutsch,
Peter Simpkin, Ron Sarkar, and Vanessa Green.  Clive Lindley has played
a special role through his valuable advice from the beginning.

My brothers and sister and my relatives and friends in China have
generously allowed me to tell their stories, without which

Wild Swans would not have been possible.  I can never thank them
sufficiently.

Much of the book is the story of my mother.  I hope I have done her
justice.

1. "Three-Inch Golden Ulies'-Concubine to a Warlord General
(1gOg-1955)

At the age of fifteen my grandmother became the concubine of a warlord
general, the police chief of a tenuous national government of China.
The year was 1924 and China was in chaos.  Much of it, including
Manchuria, where my grandmother lived, was ruled by warlords.  The
liaison was arranged by her father, a police official in the provincial
town of Yixian in southwest Manchuria, about a hundred miles north of
the Great Wall and 250 miles northeast of Peking.

Like most towns in China, Yixian was built like a fortress.  It was
encircled by walls thirty feet high and twelve feet thick dating from
the Tang dynasty (AD 618-9o7), surmounted by battlements, dotted with
sixteen forts at regular intervals, and wide enough to ride a horse
quite easily along the top.  There were four gates into the city, one
at each point of the compass, with outer protecting gates, and the
fortifications were surrounded by a deep moat.

The town's most conspicuous feature was a tall, richly decorated bell
tower of dark brown stone, which had originally been built in the sixth
century when Buddhism had

28 "Three-Inch Golden Lilies' been introduced to the area.  Every night
the bell was rung to signal the time, and the tower also functioned as
a fire and flood alarm.  Yixian was a prosperous market town.

The plains around produced cotton, maize, sorghum, soybeans, sesame,
pears, apples, and grapes.  In the grassland areas and in the hills to
the west, farmers grazed sheep and cat He

My great-grandfather, Yang Ru-shan, was born in 1894, when the whole of
China was ruled by an emperor who resided in Peking.  The imperial
family were Manchus who had conquered China in 1644 from Manchuria,
which was their base.  The Yangs were Han, ethnic Chinese, and had
ventured north of the Great Wall in search of opportunity.

My great-grandfather was the only son, which made him of supreme
importance to his family.  Only a son could perpetuate the family name
without him, the family line would stop, which, to the Chinese,
amounted to the greatest possible betrayal of one's ancestors.  He was
sent to a good school.  The goal was for him to pass the examinations
to become a mandarin, an official, which was the aspiration of most
Chinese males at the time.  Being an official brought power, and power
brought money.  Without power or money, no Chinese could feel safe from
the depredations of officialdom or random violence.  There had never
been a proper legal system.  Justice was arbitrary, and cruelty was
both institutionalized and capricious.  An official with power was the
law.  Becoming a mandarin was the only way the child of a non-noble
family could escape this cycle of injustice and fear.  Yang's father
had decided that his son should not follow him into the family business
of felt-making, and sacrificed himself and his family to pay for his
son's education.  The women took in sewing for local tailors and
dressmakers, toiling late into the night.

To save money, they turned their oil lamps down to the absolute
minimum, causing lasting damage to their eyes.

The joints in their fingers became swollen from the long hours.

Following the custom, my great-grandfather was married young, at
fourteen, to a woman six years his senior.  It was considered one of
the duties of a wife to help bring up her husband.

The story of his wife, my great-grandmother, was typical of millions of
Chinese women of her time.  She came from a family of tanners called
Wu.  Because her family was not an intellectual one and did not hold
any official post, and because she was a girl, she was not given a name
at all.

Being the second daughter, she was simply called "Number Two Girl'
(Er-ya-tou).  Her father died when she was an infant, and she was
brought up by an uncle.  One day, when she was six years old, the uncle
was dining with a friend whose wife was pregnant.  Over dinner the two
men agreed that if the baby was a boy he would be married to the
six-year-old niece.  The two young people never met before their
wedding.  In fact, falling in love was considered almost shameful, a
family disgrace.  Not because it was taboo there was, after all, a
venerable tradition of romantic love in China but because young people
were not supposed to be exposed to situations where such a thing could
happen, partly because it was immoral for them to meet, and partly
because marriage was seen above all as a duty, an arrangement between
two families.  With luck, one could fall in love after getting
married.

At fourteen, and having lived a very sheltered life, my
great-grandfather was little more than a boy at the time of his
marriage.  On the first night, he did not want to go into the wedding
chamber.  He went to bed in his mother's room and had to be carried in
to his bride after he fell asleep.  But, although he was a spoiled
child and still needed help to get dressed, he knew how to 'plant
children," according to his wife.  My grandmother was born within a
year of the wedding, on the fifth day of the fifth moon, in early
summer 19o9.  She was in a better position than her mother, for she was
actually given a name: Yufang.  Yu, meaning 'jade," was her generation
name, given to

30 "Three-Inch Golden Lilies' all the offspring of the same generation,
while fang means 'fragrant flowers."

The world she was born into was one of total unpredictability.  The
Manchu empire, which had ruled China for over 260 years, was tottering.
In x894-95 Japan attacked China in Manchuria, with China suffering
devastating defeats and loss of territory.  In 19OO the nationalist
Boxer Rebellion was put down by eight foreign armies, contingents of
which had stayed on, some in Manchuria and some along the Great Wall.
Then in 19o4-5 Japan and Russia fought a major war on the plains of
Manchuria.

Japan's victory made it the dominant outside force in Manchuria.  In
1911 the five-year-old emperor of China, Pu Yi, was overthrown and a
republic was set up with the charismatic figure of Sun Yat-sen briefly
at its head.

The new republican government soon collapsed and the country broke up
into fiefs.  Manchuria was particularly disaffected from the republic,
since the Manchu dynasty had originated there.  Foreign powers,
especially Japan, intensified their attempts to encroach on the area.
Under all these pressures, the old institutions collapsed, resulting in
a vacuum of power, morality, and authority.  Many people sought to get
to the top by bribing local potentates with expensive gifts like gold,
silver, and jewelry.  My great grandfather was not rich enough to buy
himself a lucrative position in a big city, and by the time he was
thirty he had risen no higher than an official in the police station of
his native Yixian, a provincial backwater.  But he had plans.

And he had one valuable asset his daughter.

My grandmother was a beauty.  She had an oval face, with rosy cheeks
and lustrous skin.  Her long, shiny black hair was woven into a thick
plait reaching down to her waist.

She could be demure when the occasion demanded, which was most of the
time, but underneath her composed exterior she was bursting with
suppressed energy.  She was petite, about five feet three inches, with
a slender figure

Concubine to a Warlord General 3 l and sloping shoulders, which were
considered the ideal.

But her greatest assets were her bound feet, called in Chinese
'three-inch golden lilies' (san-tsun-gin-lian).  This meant she walked
'like a tender young willow shoot in a spring breeze," as Chinese
connoisseurs of women traditionally put it.  The sight of a woman
teetering on bound feet was supposed to have an erotic effect on men,
partly because her vulnerability induced a feeling of protectiveness in
the onlooker.

My grandmother's feet had been bound when she was two years old.  Her
mother, who herself had bound feet, first wound a piece of white cloth
about twenty feet long round her feet, bending all the toes except the
big toe inward and under the sole.  Then she placed a large stone on
top to crush the arch.  My grandmother screamed in agony and begged her
to stop.  Her mother had to stick a cloth into her mouth to gag her. My
grandmother passed out repeatedly from the pain.

The process lasted several years.  Even after the bones had been
broken, the feet had to be bound day and night in thick cloth because
the moment they were released they would try to recover.  For years my
grandmother lived in relentless, excruciating pain.  When she pleaded
with her mother to untie the bindings, her' mother would weep and tell
her that unbound feet would ruin her entire life, and that she was
doing it for her own future happiness.

In those days, when a woman was married, the first thing the
bridegroom's family did was to examine her feet.  Large feet, meaning
normal feet, were considered to bring shame on the husband's household.
The mother-in-law would lift the hem of the bride's long skirt, and if
the feet were more than about four inches long, she would throw down
the skirt in a demonstrative gesture of contempt and stalk off, leaving
the bride to the critical gaze of the wedding guests, who would stare
at her feet and insultingly mutter their disdain.  Sometimes a mother
would take pity on her daughter and remove the binding cloth; but when
the child
grew up and had to endure the contempt of
her husband's family and the disapproval of society, she would blame
her mother for having been too weak.

The practice of binding feet was originally introduced about a thousand
years ago, allegedly by a concubine of the emperor.  Not only was the
sight of women hobbling on tiny feet considered erotic, men would also
get excited playing with bound feet, which were always hidden in
embroidered silk shoes.  Women could not remove the binding cloths even
when they were adults, as their feet would start growing again.  The
binding could only be loosened temporarily at night in bed, when they
would put on soft-soled shoes.  Men rarely saw naked bound feet, which
were usually covered in rot ling flesh and stank when the bindings were
removed.  As a child, I can remember my grandmother being in constant
pain.  When we came home from shopping, the first thing she would do
was soak her feet in a bowl of hot water, sighing with relief as she
did so.  Then she would set about cutting off pieces of dead skin.  The
pain came not only from the broken bones, but also from her toenails,
which grew into the balls of her feet.

In fact, my grandmother's feet were bound just at the moment when
foot-binding was disappearing for good.  By the time her sister was
born in 1917, the practice had virtually been abandoned, so she escaped
the torment.

However, when my grandmother was growing up, the prevailing attitude in
a small town like Yh~a was still that bound feet were essential for a
good marriage but they were only a start.  Her father's plans were for
her to be trained as either a perfect lady or a high-class courtesan.

Scorning the received wisdom of the time that it was virtuous for a
lower class woman to be illiterate he sent her to a girl's school that
had been set up in the town in 19o5.  She also learned to play Chinese
chess, mahjongg, and go.  She studied drawing and embroidery.  Her
favorite design was mandarin ducks (which symbolize love, because they
always swim in pairs), and she used to embroider them onto the tiny
shoes she made for herself.  To crown her list of accomplishments, a
tutor was hired to teach her to play the qin, a musical instrument like
a zither.

My grandmother was considered the belle of the town.

The locals said she stood out 'like a crane among chickens."

In 1924 she was fifteen, and her father was growing worried that time
might be running out on his only real asset and his only chance for a
life of ease.  In that year General Xue Zhi-heng, the inspector general
of the Metropolitan Police of the warlord government in Peking, came to
pay a visit.

Xue Zhi-heng was born in i876 in the county of Lulong, about a hundred
miles east of Peking, and just south of the Great Wall, where the vast
North China plain runs up against the mountains.  He was the eldest of
four sons of a country schoolteacher.

He was handsome and had a powerful presence, which struck all who met
him.  Several blind fortune-tellers who felt his face predicted he
would rise to a powerful position.

He was a gifted calligrapher, a talent held in high esteem, and in 1908
a warlord named Wang Huai-qing, who was visiting Lulong, noticed the
fine calligraphy on a plaque over the gate of the main temple and asked
to meet the man who had done it.  General Wang took to the thirty
two-year-old Xue and invited him to become his aide de -camp.

He proved extremely efficient, and was soon promoted to quartermaster.
This involved extensive traveling, and he started to acquire food shops
of his own around Lulong and on the other side of the Great Wall, in
Manchuria.

His rapid rise was boosted when he helped General Wang to suppress an
uprising in Inner Mongolia.  In almost no time he had amassed a
fortune, and he designed and built for himself an eighty-one-room
mansion at Lulong.

In the decade after the end of the empire, no government established
authority over the bulk of the country.

34 "Three-Inch Golden Lilies' 
Powerful warlords were soon fighting for
control of the central government in Peking.  Xue's faction, headed by
a warlord called Wu Pei-fu, dominated the nominal government in Peking
in the early 1920s.  In 1911 Xue became inspector general of the
Metropolitan Police and joint head of the Public Works Department in
Peking.  He commanded twenty regions on both sides of the Great Wall,
and more than 10,000 mounted police and infantry.  The police job gave
him power; the public works post gave him patronage.

*#06#
Allegiances were fickle.  In May 1923 General Xue's faction decided to
get rid of the president, Li Yuan-hong, whom it had installed in office
only a year earlier.  In league with a general called Feng Yu-xiang, a
Christian warlord, who entered legend by baptizing his troops en masse
with a firehose, Xue mobilized his 10,000 men and surrounded the main
government buildings in Peking, demanding the back pay which the
bankrupt government owed his men.  His real aim was to humiliate
President Li and force him out of office.  Li refused to resign, so Xue
ordered his men to cut off the water and electricity to the
presidential palace.  After a few days, conditions inside the building
became unbearable, and on the night of 13 June President Li abandoned
his malodorous residence and fled the capital for the port city of

Tianjin, seventy miles to the southeast.

In China the authority of an office lay not only in its holder but in
the official seals.  No document was valid, even if it had the
president's signature on it, unless it carried his seal.  Knowing that
no one could take over the presidency without them, President Li left
the seals with one of his concubines, who was convalescing in a
hospital in Peking run by French missionaries.

As President Li was nearing Tianjin his train was stopped by armed
police, who told him to hand over the seals.  At first he refused to
say where he had hidden them, but after several hours he relented.  At
three in the morning

General Xue went to the French hospital to collect the seals from the
concubine.  When he appeared by her bedside, the concubine at first
refused even to look at him:

"How can I hand over the president's seals to a mere policeman?"  she
said haughtily.  But General Xue, resplendent in his full uniform,
looked so intimidating that she soon meekly placed the seals in his
hands.

Over the next four months, Xue used his police to make sure that the
man his faction wanted to see as president, Tsao Kun, would win what
was billed as one of China's first elections.  The 804 members of
parliament had to be bribed.  Xue and General Feng stationed guards on
the parliament building and let it be known that there would be a
handsome consideration for anyone who voted the right way, which
brought many deputies scurrying back from the provinces.  By the time
everything was ready for the election there were 555 members of
parliament in Peking.  Four days before the election, after much
bargaining, they were each given 5,000 silver yuan, a rather
substantial sum.  On 5 October 1923, Tsao Kun was elected president of
China with 480 votes.  Xue was rewarded with promotion to full general.
Also promoted were seventeen 'special advisers' all favorite mistresses
or concubines of various warlords and generals.  This episode has
entered Chinese history as a notorious example of how an election can
be manipulated.  People still cite it to argue that democracy will not
work in China.

In early summer the following year General Xue visited Yixian.  Though
it was not a large town, it was strategically important.  It was about
here that the writ of the Peking government began to run out.  Beyond,
power was in the hands of the great warlord of the northeast, Chang
Tso-lin, known as the Old Marshal.  Officially, General Xue was on an
inspection trip, but he also had some personal interests in the area.
In Yixian he owned the main grain stores and the biggest shops,
including a pawnshop which doubled as the bank and issued its own
money, which circulated in the town and the surrounding area.

36 "Three-Inch Golden Lilies'

For my great-grandfather, this was a once-in-a-lifetime chance, the
closest he was ever going to get to a real V.I.P.

He schemed to get himself the job of escorting General Xue, and told
his wife he was going to try to marry their daughter off to him.  He
did not ask his wife for her agreement; he merely informed her.  Quite
apart from this being the custom of the day, my great-grandfather
despised his wife.  She wept, but said nothing.  He told her she must
not breathe a word to their daughter.  There was no question of
consulting his daughter.  Marriage was a transaction, not a matter of
feelings.  She would be informed when the wedding was arranged.

My great-grandfather knew that his approach to General

Xue had to be indirect.  An explicit offer of his daughter's hand would
lower her price, and there was also the possibility that he might be
turned down.  General Xue had to have a chance to see what he was being
offered.  In those days respectable women could not be introduced to
strange men, so Yang had to create an opportunity for General Xue to
see his daughter.  The encounter had to seem accidental.

In Yixian there was a magnificent 9o0-year-old Buddhist temple made of
precious wood and standing about a hundred feet high.  It was set
within an elegant precinct, with rows of cypress trees, which covered
an area of almost a square mile.  Inside was a brightly painted wooden
statue of the Buddha, thirty feet high, and the interior of the temple
was covered with delicate murals depicting his life.

It was an obvious place for Yang to take the visiting V.I.P.

And temples were among the few places women of good families could go
on their own.

My grandmother was told to go to the temple on a certain day.  To show
her reverence for the Buddha, she took perfumed baths and spent long
hours meditating in front of burning incense at a little shrine.  To
pray in the temple she was supposed to be in a state of maximum
tranquillity, and to be free of all unsettling emotions.  She set off
in a , rented horse-drawn carriage, accompanied by a maid.  She wore a
duck-egg-blue jacket, its edges embroidered in gold thread to show off
its simple lines, with butterfly buttons up the right-hand side.  With
this she wore a pleated pink skirt, embroidered all over with tiny
flowers.  Her long black hair was woven into a single plait.  Peeping
out at the top was a silk black-green peony, the rarest kind.  She wore
no makeup, but was richly scented, as was considered appropriate for a
visit to a temple.  Once inside, she knelt before the giant statue of
the Buddha.  She kowtowed several times to the wooden image and then
remained kneeling before it, her hands clasped in prayer.

As she was praying, her father arrived with General Xue.

The two men watched from the dark aisle.  My great grandfather had
planned well.  The position in which my grandmother was kneeling
revealed not only her silk trousers, which were edged in gold like her
jacket, but also her tiny feet in their embroidered satin shoes.

When she finished praying, my grandmother kowtowed three times to the
Buddha.  As she stood up she slightly lost her balance, which was easy
to do with bound feet.

She reached out to steady herself on her maid's arm.  General Xue and
her father had just begun to move forward.

She blushed and bent her head, then turned and started to walk away,
which was the right thing to do.  Her father stepped forward and
introduced her to the general.  She curtsied, keeping her head lowered
all the time.

As was fitting for a man in his position, the general did not say much
about the meeting to Yang, who was a rather lowly subordinate, but my
great-grandfather could see he was fascinated.  The next step was to
engineer a more direct encounter.  A couple of days later Yang risking
bankruptcy, rented the best theater in town and put on a local opera,
inviting General Xue as the guest of honor.  Like most Chinese
theaters, it was built around a rectangular space open to the sky, with
timber structures on three sides; the fourth side formed the stage,
which was completely bare:

it had no curtain and no sets.  The seating area was more

like a cafe than a theater in the West. The men sat at tables in the
open square, eating, drinking, and talking loudly throughout the
performance.  To the side, higher up, was the dress circle, where the
ladies sat more demurely at smaller tables, with their maids standing
behind them.  My great-grandfather had arranged things so that his
daughter was in a place where General Xue could see her easily.

This time she was much more dressed up than in the temple.  She wore a
heavily embroidered satin dress and jewelry in her hair.  She was also
displaying her natural vivacity and energy, laughing and chatting with
her women friends.  General Xue hardly looked at the stage.

After the show there was a traditional Chinese game called
lantern-riddles.  This took place in two separate halls, one for the
men and one for the women.  In each room were dozens of elaborate paper
lanterns, stuck on which were a number of riddles in verse.  The person
who guessed the most answers won a prize.  Among the men General Xue
was the winner, naturally.  Among the women, it was my grandmother.

Yang had now given General Xue a chance to appreciate his daughter's
beauty and her intelligence.  The final qualification was artistic
talent.  Two nights later he invited the general to his house for
dinner.  It was a clear, warm night, with a full moon a classic setting
for listening to the qin.  After dinner, the men sat on the veranda and
my grandmother was summoned to play in the courtyard.  Sitting under a
trellis, with the scent of syringa in the air, her performance
enchanted General Xue.  Later he was to tell her that her playing that
evening in the moonlight had captured his heart.  When my mother was
born, he gave her the name Bao (~I'm, which means "Precious Zither."

Before the evening was over he had proposed not to my grandmother, of
course, but to her father.  He did not offer marriage, only that my
grandmother should become his concubine.  But Yang had not expected
anything else.

*#06#
The Xue family would have arranged a marriage for the general long
before on the basis of social positions.  In any case, the Yangs were
too humble to provide a wife.  But it was expected that a man like
General Xue should take concubines.  Wives were not for pleasure that
was what concubines were for.  Concubines might acquire considerable
power, but their social status was quite different from that of a wife.
A concubine was a kind of institutionalized mistress, acquired and
discarded at will.

The first my grandmother knew of her impending liaison was when her
mother broke the news to her a few days before the event.  My
grandmother bent her head and wept.

She hated the idea of being a concubine, but her father had already
made the decision, and it was unthinkable to oppose one's parents.  To
question a parental decision was considered unfilial and to be un
filial was tantamount to treason.  Even if she refused to consent to
her father's wishes, she would not be taken seriously; her action would
be interpreted as indicating that she wanted to stay with her parents.
The only way to say no and be taken seriously was to commit suicide. My
grandmother bit her lip and said nothing.  In fact, there was nothing
she could say.  Even to say yes would be considered unladylike, as it
would be taken to imply that she was eager to leave her parents.

Seeing how unhappy she was, her mother started telling her that this
was the best match possible.  Her husband had told her about General
Xue's power: "In Peking they say, "When General Xue stamps his foot,
the whole city shakes."  In fact, my grandmother had been rather taken
with the general's handsome, martial demeanor.  And she had been
flattered by all the admiring words he had said about her to her
father, which were now elaborated and embroidered upon.  None of the
men in Yixian were as impressive as the warlord general.  At fifteen,
she had no idea what being a concubine really meant, and thought she
could win General Xue's love and lead a happy life.

General Xue had said that she could stay in Yixian, in a house which he
was going to buy especially for her.  This

40 "Three-Inch Golden Lilies' 
meant she could be close to her own
family, but, even more important, she would not have to live in his
residence, where she would have to submit to the authority of his wife
and the other concubines, who would all have precedence over her.  In
the house of a potentate like General Xue, the women were virtual
prisoners, living in a state of permanent squabbling and bickering,
largely induced by insecurity.  The only security they had was their
husband's favor.

General Xue's offer of a house of her own meant a lot to my
grandmother, as did his promise to solemnize the liaison with a full
wedding ceremony.  This meant that she and her family would have gained
a considerable amount of face.  And there was one final consideration
which was very important to her: now that her father was satisfied, she
hoped he would treat her mother better.

Mrs. Yang suffered from epilepsy, which made her feel undeserving
towards her husband.  She was always submissive to him, and he treated
her like dirt, showing no concern for her health.  For years, he found
fault with her for not producing a son.  My great-grandmother had a
string of miscarriages after my grandmother was born, un61 a second
child came along in 1917 but again, it was a girl.

My great-grandfather was obsessed with having enough money to be able
to acquire concubines.  The 'wedding' allowed him to fulfill this wish,
as General Xue lavished betrothal gifts on the family, and the chief
beneficiary was my great-grandfather.  The gifts were magnificent, in
keeping with the general's station.

On the day of the wedding, a sedan chair draped with heavy, bright-red
embroidered silk and satin appeared at the Yangs' house.  In front came
a procession carrying banners, plaques, and silk lanterns painted with
images of a golden phoenix, the grandest s3nnbol for a woman.  The
wedding ceremony took place in the evening, as was the tradition, with
red lanterns glowing in the dusk.  There was an orchestra with drums,
cymbals, and piercing wind

Concubine to a Warlord Genera/ 4 I instruments playing joyful music.
Making a lot of noise was considered essential for a good wedding, as
keeping quiet would have been seen as suggesting that there was
something shameful about the event.  My grandmother was splendidly
dressed in bright embroidery, with a red silk veil coveting her head
and face.  She was carried in the sedan chair to her new home by eight
men.  Inside the sedan chair it was stuffy and boiling hot, and she
discreetly pulled the curtain back a few inches.  Peeping out from
under her veil, she was delighted to see people in the streets watching
her procession.  This was very different from what a mere concubine
would get a small sedan chair draped in plain cotton of the unglamorous
color of indigo, borne by two or at the most four people, and no
procession or music.  She was taken right around the town, visiting all
four gates, as a full ritual demanded, with her expensive wedding gifts
displayed on cans and in large wicker baskets carried behind her. After
she had been shown off to the town, she reached her new home, a large,
stylish residence.  My grandmother was satisfied.  The pomp and
ceremony made her feel she had gained prestige and esteem.  There had
been nothing like this in Yixian in living memory.

When she reached the house General Xue, in full military dress, was
waiting, surrounded by the local dignitaries.

Red candles and dazzling gas lamps lit up the center of the house, the
sitting room, where they performed a ceremonial kowtow to the tablets
of Heaven and Earth.  After this, they kowtowed to each other, then my
grandmother went into the wedding chamber alone, in accordance with the
custom, while General Xue went off to a lavish banquet with the men.

General Xue did not leave the house for three days.  My grandmother was
happy.  She thought she loved him, and he showed her a kind of gruff
affection.  But he hardly spoke to her about serious matters, in
keeping with the traditional saying: "Women have long hair and short
intellio

42 "Three-Inch Golden Lilies' gence."  A Chinese man was supposed to
remain reticent and grand, even within his family.  So she kept quiet,
just massaging his toes before they got up in the morning and playing
the qin to him in the evening.  After a week, he suddenly told her he
was leaving.  He did not say where he was going and she knew it was not
a good idea to ask.

Her duty was to wait for him until he came back.  She had to wait six
years.

In September 1924, fighting erupted between the two main warlord
factions in North China.  General Xue was promoted to deputy commander
of the Peking garrison, but within weeks his old ally General Feng, the
Christian warlord, changed sides.  On 3 November, Tsao Kun, whom

General Xue and General Feng had helped install as president the
previous year, was forced to resign.  The same day the Peking garrison
was dismissed, and two days later the

Peking police office was disbanded.  General Xue had to leave the
capital in a hurry.  He retired to a house he owned in Tianjin, in the
French concession, which had extraterritorial immunity.  This was the
very place to which President

Li had fled the year before when Xue had forced him out of the
presidential palace.

In the meantime my grandmother was caught up in the renewed fighting.
Control of the northeast was vital in the struggle between the warlord
armies, and towns on the railway, especially junctions like Yixian,
were particular targets.  Shortly after General Xue left, the fighfng
came right up to the walls of the town, with pitched battles just
outside the gates.  Loofng was widespread.  One Italian arms company
appealed to the cash-strapped warlords by advertising that it would
accept loo table villages' as collateral.  Rape was just as
commonplace.  Like many other women, my grandmother had to blacken her
face with soot to make herself look filthy and ugly.  Fortunately, this
time

Yixian emerged virtually unscathed.  The fighfng eventually moved south
and life returned to normal.

For my grandmother, 'normal' meant finding ways to kill time in her
large house.  The house was built in the typical North Chinese style,
around three sides of a quadrangle, the south side of the courtyard
being a wall about seven feet high, with a moon gate which opened onto
an outer courtyard, which in turn was guarded by a double gate with a
round brass knocker.

These houses were built to cope with the extremes of a brutally harsh
climate, which lurched from freezing winters to scorching summers, with
virtually no spring or autumn in between.  In summer, the temperature
could rise above 95 F, but in winter it fell to minus 2o F, with
howling winds which roared down from Siberia across the plains.

Dust tore into the eyes and bit into the skin for much of the year, and
people often had to wear masks which covered their entire faces and
heads.  In the inner courtyard of the houses, all the windows in the
main rooms opened to the south to let in as much sunshine as possible,
while the walls on the north side took the brunt of the wind and the
dust.  The north side of the house contained a sitting room and my
grandmother's chamber; the wings on the two sides were for the servants
and for all other activities.
*#06#
The floors of the main rooms were tiled, while the wooden windows were
covered with paper.  The pitched roof was made of smooth black files.

The house was luxurious by local standards and far superior to her
parents' home but my grandmother was lonely and miserable.  There were
several servants, including a doorkeeper, a cook, and two maids.  Their
task was not only to serve, but also to act as guards and spies.  The
doorkeeper was under instructions not to let my grandmother out alone
under any circumstances.  Before he left, General Xue told my
grandmother a cautionary tale about one of his other concubines.  He
had found out that she had been having an affair with a male servant,
so he had her tied to a bed and stuffed a gag into her mouth.  Then raw
alcohol was dripped onto the cloth, slowly choking her to death.

"Of course, I could not give her the pleasure of

44 "Three-Inch Golden Lilies' dying speedily.  For a woman to betray
her husband is the vilest thing possible," he said.  Where infidelity
was involved, a man like General Xue would hate the woman far more than
the man.

"All I did with the lover was have him shot," he added casually.  My
grandmother never knew whether or not all this had really happened, but
at the age of fifteen she was suitably petrified.

From that moment she lived in constant fear.  Because she could hardly
ever go out, she had to create a world for herself within the four
walls.  But even there she was not the real mistress of her home, and
she had to spend a great deal of time buttering up the servants in case
they invented stories against her which was so common it was considered
almost inevitable.  She gave them plenty of presents, and also
organized mahjongg parties, because the winners would always have to
tip the servants generously.

She was never short of money.  General Xue sent her a regular
allowance, which was delivered every month by the manager of his
pawnshop, who also picked up the bills for her losses at the mahjongg
parties.

Throwing mahjongg parties was a normal part of life for concubines all
over China.  So was smoking opium, which was widely available and was
seen as a means of keeping people like her contented by being doped and
dependent.  Many concubines became addicted in their attempts to ape
with their loneliness.  General Xue encouraged my grandmother to take
up the habit, but she ignored him.

Almost the only time she was allowed out of the house was to go to the
opera.  Otherwise, she had to sit at home all day, every day.  She read
a lot, mainly plays and novels, and tended her favorite flowers, garden
balsam, hibiscus, common four-o'clock, and roses of Sharon in pots in
the courtyard, where she also cultivated dwarf trees.  Her other
consolation in her gilded cage was a cat.

She was allowed to visit her parents, but even this was frowned upon,
and she was not permitted to stay the night with them.  Although they
were the only people she could talk to, she found visiting them a
trial.  Her father had been promoted to deputy chief of the local
police because of his connection to General Xue, and had acquired land
and property.  Every time she opened her mouth about how miserable she
was, her father would start lecturing her, telling her that a virtuous
woman should suppress her emotions and not desire anything beyond her
duty to her husband.  It was all right to miss her husband, that was
virtuous, but a woman was not supposed to complain.  In fact, a good
woman was not supposed to have a point of view at all, and if she did,
she certainly should not be so brazen as to talk about it.  He would
quote the Chinese saying, "If you are married to a chicken, obey the
chicken; if you are married to a dog, obey the dog."

Six years passed.  To begin with, there were a few letters, then total
silence.  Unable to burn off her nervous energy and sexual frustration,
unable even to pace the floor with a full stride because of her bound
feet, my grandmother was reduced to mincing around the house.  At
first, she hoped for some message, going over and over again in her
mind her brief life with the general.  Even her physical and
psychological submission was mulled over nostalgically.

She missed him very much, though she knew that she was only one of his
many concubines, probably dotted around China, and she had never
imagined that she would spend the rest of her life with him.  Still she
longed for him, as he represented her only chance to live a sort of
life.

But as the weeks turned into months, and the months into years, her
longing became dulled.  She came to realize that for him she was a mere
plaything, to be picked up again only when it was convenient for him.
Her restlessness now had no object on which to focus.  It became forced
into a straitjacket.  When occasionally it stretched its limbs she felt
so agitated she did not know what to do with herself.  Sometimes, she
would fall to the floor un con 46 "Three-Inch Golden Lilies' sc ious
She was to have blackouts like these for the rest of her life.

Then one day, six years after he had walked casually out of the door,
her 'husband' reappeared.  The meeting was very unlike what she had
dreamed of at the beginning of their separation.  Then she had
fantasized that she would give herself totally and passionately to him,
but now all she could find in herself was restrained dutifulness.  She
was also racked with anxiety in case she might have offended one of the
servants, or that they might invent stories to ingratiate themselves
with the general and ruin her life.

But everything went smoothly.  The general, now past fifty, seemed m
have mellowed, and did not look nearly as majestic as before.  As she
expected, he did not say a word about where he had been, why he had
left so suddenly, or why he was back, and she did not ask.  Quite apart
from not wanting to be scolded for being inquisitive, she did not
care.

In fact, all this time the general had not been far away at all.  He
had been leading the quiet life of a wealthy retired dignitary,
dividing his time between his house in Tianjin and his country mansion
near Lulong.  The world in which he had flourished was becoming a thing
of the past.  The warlord and their fief system had collapsed and most
of China was now controlled by a force, the Kuomintang, or
Nationalists, headed by Chiang Kai-shek.

To mark the break with the chaotic past, and to try to give the
appearance of a new start and of stability, the Kuomintang moved the
capital from Peking ("Northern Capital') to Nanjing ("Southern
Capital').  In 19z8, the ruler of Manchuria, Chang Tso-lin, the Old
Marshal, was assassinated by the Japanese, who were becoming
increasingly active in the area.  The Old Marshal's son, Chang
Hsueh-liang (known as the Young Marshal), joined up with the Kuomintang
and formally integrated Manchuria with the rest of China- though
Kuomintang rule was never effectively established in Manchuria.

General Xue's visit to my grandmother did not last long.

Just like the first time, after a few days he suddenly announced he was
leaving.  The night before he was due to leave, he asked my grandmother
to go and live with him at Lulong.  Her heart missed a beat.  If he
ordered her to go, it would amount to a life sentence under the same
roof as his wife and his other concubines.  She was invaded by a wave
of panic.  As she massaged his feet, she quietly pleaded with him to
let her stay in Yixian.  She told him how kind he was to have promised
her parents he would not take her away from them, and gently reminded
him that her mother was not in good health: she had just had a third
child, the longed-for son.  She said that she would like to observe
filial piety, while, of course, serving him, her husband and master,
whenever he graced Yixian with his presence.  The next day she packed
his things and he left, alone.  On his departure, as on his arrival, he
showered jewels on my grandmother gold, silver, jade, pearls, and
emeralds.  Like many men of his kind, he believed this was the way to a
woman's heart.  For women like my grandmother, jewelry was their only
insurance.

A short time later, my grandmother realized she was pregnant.  On the
seventeenth day of the third moon, in spring 193i, she gave birth to a
baby girl my mother.

She wrote to General Xue to let him know, and he wrote back telling her
to call the gift Bao Q~m and to bring her to Lulong as soon as they
were strong enough to travel.

My grandmother was ecstatic at having a child.  Now, she felt, her life
had a purpose, and she poured all her love and energy into my mother. A
happy year passed.  General Xue wrote many times asking her to come to
Lulong, but each time she managed to stall him.  Then, one day in the
middle of summer 1932, a telegram arrived saying that General Xue was
seriously ill and ordering her to bring their daughter to see him at
once.  The tone made it clear that this time she should not refuse.

Lulong was about 200 miles away, and for my grandmother, who had never
traveled, the journey was a major undertaking.  It was also extremely
difficult to travel with bound feet; it was almost impossible to carry
luggage, especially with a young child in one's arms.  My grandmother
decided to take her fourteen-year-old sister, Yulan, whom she called
"Lan," with her.

The journey was an adventure.  The area had been convulsed yet again.
In September 193I Japan, which had been steadily expanding its power in
the area, had launched a full-scale invasion of Manchuria, and Japanese
troops had occupied Yixian on 6 January 1932.  Two months later the
Japanese proclaimed the founding of a new state, which they named
Manchukuo ("Manchu

Country'), covering most of northeast China (an area the size of France
and Germany combined).  The Japanese claimed that Manchukuo was
independent, but in fact it was a puppet of Tokyo.  As its head they
installed Pu

Yi, who as a child had been the last emperor of China.

At first he was called Chief Executive; later, in 1934, he was made
emperor of Manchukuo.  All this meant little to my grandmother, who had
had very little contact with the outside world.  The general population
were fatalistic about who their rulers were, since they had no choice
in the matter.  For many, Pu Yi was the natural ruler, a Manchu emperor
and proper Son of Heaven.

Twenty years after the republican revolution there was still no unified
nation to replace the rule of the emperor, nor, in Manchuria, did the
people have much concept of being citizens of something called
"China."

One hot summer's day in 1932 my grandmother, her sister, and my mother
took the train south from Yixian, passing out of Manchuria at the town
of Shanhaiguan, where the Great Wall sweeps down from the mountains to
the sea.  As the train chugged along the coastal plain, they could see
the landscape changing: instead of the bare,

brown-yellow soil of the plains of Manchuria, here the earth was darker
and the vegetation denser, almost lush compared with the northeast.
Soon after it passed the Great Wall, the train turned inland, and about
an hour later it stopped at a town called Changli where they
disembarked at a green-roofed building which looked like a railway
station in Siberia.

My grandmother hired a horse-drawn cart and drove north along a bumpy,
dusty road to General Xue's mansion, which lay about twenty miles away,
just outside the wall of a small town called Yanheying, which had once
been a major military camp frequently visited by the Manchu emperors
and their court.  Hence the road had acquired the grand name of 'the
Imperial Way."  It was lined with poplars, their light-green leaves
shimmering in the sunlight.  Beyond them were orchards of peach trees,
which flourished in the sandy soil.  But my grandmother scarcely
enjoyed the scenery, as she was covered in dust and jolted badly by the
rough road.  Above all, she was worrying about what would greet her at
the other end.

When she first saw the mansion, she was overwhelmed by its grandeur.
The immense front gate was guarded by armed men, who stood stiffly at
attention beside enormous statues of reclining lions.  There was a row
of eight stone statues for tying up horses: four were of elephants, and
four of monkeys.  These two animals were chosen for their lucky sounds:
in Chinese the words 'elephant' and 'high office' have the same sound
(xiang), as do 'monkey' and 'aristocracy' (hou).

As the cart passed through the outer gate into an inner yard my
grandmother could see only a huge blank wall facing her; then, off to
one side, she saw a second gate.

This was a classic Chinese structure, a concealing wall so that
strangers could not see into one's property, also making it impossible
for assailants to shoot or charge directly through the front gate.

The moment they passed through the inner gate, a

50 "Three-Inch Golden Lilies' servant materialized at my grandmother's
side and peremptorily took her child away.  Another servant led my
grandmother up the steps of the house and showed her into the sitting
room of General Xue's wife.

As soon as she entered the room, my grandmother went down on her knees
and kowtowed, saying, "I greet you, my mistress," as etiquette
demanded.  My grandmother's sister was not allowed into the room, but
had to stand outside like a servant.  This was nothing personal: the
relatives of a concubine were not treated as part of the family.  After
my grandmother had kowtowed for a suitable length of time, the
general's wife told her she could get up, using a form of address which
immediately established my grandmother's place in the hierarchy of the
household as a mere sub mistress closer to a higher form of servant
than to a wife.

The general's wife told her to sit down.  My grandmother had to make a
split-second decision.  In a traditional Chinese household, where one
sits automatically reflects one's status.  General Xue's wife was
sitting at the north end of the room, as befitted a person in her
position.  Next to her, separated by a side table, was another chair,
also facing south: this was the general's seat.  Down each side of the
room was a row of chairs for people of different status.  My
grandmother shuffled backwards and sat on one of the chairs nearest the
door, to show humility.  The wife then asked her to come forward just a
little.  She had to show some generosity.

When my grandmother was seated, the wife told her that from now on her
daughter would be brought up as her (the wife's) own daughter and would
call her, not my grandmother, "Mama'; my grandmother was to treat the
child as the young mistress of the house, and was to behave
accordingly.

A maid was summoned to lead my grandmother away.

She felt her heart was breaking, but she forced back her sobs, only
letting herself go when she reached her room.  Her eyes were still red
when she was taken to meet General

Concubine to a Warlord General 5 I Xue's number-two concubine, his
favorite, who ran the household.  She was pretty, with a delicate face,
and to my grandmother's surprise she was quite sympathetic, but my
grandmother restrained herself from having a good cry with her.  In
this strange new environment, she felt intuitively that the best policy
was caution.

Later that day she was taken to see her 'husband."  She was allowed to
take my mother with her.  The general was lying on a kang, the type of
bed used all over North China, a large, flat, rectangular surface about
two and a half feet high heated from underneath by a brick stove.  A
pair of concubines or maids were kneeling round the prostrate general,
massaging his legs and stomach.  General Xue's eyes were closed, and he
looked terribly sallow.  My grandmother leaned over the edge of the
bed, calling to him softly.  He opened his eyes and managed a kind of a
half smile  My grandmother put my mother on the bed and said: "This is
Bao Odin."  With what seemed a great effort, General Xue feebly stroked
my mother's head and said, "Bao Odin takes after you; she is very
pretty."  Then he closed his eyes.

My grandmother called out to him, but his eyes remained shut.  She
could see that he was gravely ill, perhaps dying.  She picked my mother
off the bed and hugged her tight.  But she had only a second to cuddle
her before the general's wife, who had been hovering alongside, tugged
impatiently at her sleeve.  Once outside, the wife warned my
grandmother not to disturb the master too often, or indeed at all.  In
fact, she should stay in her room unless she was summoned.

My grandmother was terrified.  As a concubine, her whole future and
that of her daughter were in jeopardy, possibly even in mortal peril.
She had no rights.  If the general died, she would be at the mercy of
the wife, who had the power of life and death over her.  She could do
anything she wanted sell her to a rich man, or even into a brothel,
which was quite common.  Then my grandmother

52 "Three-Inch Golden Lilies' would never see her daughter again.  She
knew she and her daughter had to get away as fast as possible.

When she got back to her room, she made a tremendous effort to calm
herself and begin planning her escape.  But when she tried to think,
she felt as though her head were flooding with blood.  Her legs were so
weak she could not walk without holding on to the furniture.  She broke
down and wept again par fly with rage, because she could see no way
out. Worst of all was the thought that the general might die at any
moment, leaving her trapped forever.

Gradually she managed to bring her nerves under control and force
herself to think clearly.  She started to look around the mansion
systematically.  It was divided into many different courtyards, set
within a large compound, surrounded by high walls.  Even the garden was
designed with security rather than aesthetics in mind.  There were a
few cypress trees, some birches and winter plums, but none near the
walls.  To make doubly sure that any potential assassin would have no
cover, there were not even any large shrubs.  The two gates leading out
from the garden were padlocked, and the front gate was guarded around
the clock by armed retainers.

My grandmother was never allowed to leave the walled precincts.  She
was permitted to visit the general each day, but only on a sort of
organized tour with some of the other women, when she would file past
his bed and murmur, "I greet you, my lord."

Meanwhile, she began to get a clearer idea of the other personalities
in the household.  Apart from the general's wife, the woman who seemed
to count most was the number-two concubine.  My grandmother discovered
that she had instructed the servants to treat her well, which made her
situation much easier.  In a household like this, the attitude of the
servants was determined by the status of those they had to serve.  They
fawned on those in favor, and bullied those who had fallen from
grace.

The number-two concubine had a daughter a lime older than my mother.
This was a further bond between the two women, as well as being a
reason for the concubine's favor with General Xue, who had no other
children apart from my mother.

After a month, during which the two concubines became quite friendly,
my grandmother went to see the general's wife and told her she needed
to go home to fetch some clothes.  The wife gave permission, but when
my grandmother asked if she could take her daughter to say goodbye to
her grandparents, she refused.  The Xue bloodline could not be taken
out of the house.

And so my grandmother set off alone down the dusty road to Changli.
After the coachman had dropped her off at the railway station, she
started asking around among the people hanging about there.  She found
two horsemen who were prepared to provide her with the transportation
she needed.  She waited for nightfall, and then raced back to Lulong
with them and their two horses by a shortcut.  One of the men seated
her on a saddle and ran in front, holding the horse by the rein.

When she reached the mansion, she made her way to a back gate and gave
a prearranged signal.  After a wait that felt like hours but was in
fact only a few minutes, the door in the gate swung open and her sister
emerged in the moonlight, holding my mother in her arms.  The door had
been unlocked by the friendly number-two concubine, who had then hit it
with an axe to make it look as though it had been forced open.

There was hardly time for my grandmother to give my mother a quick hug
besides, she did not want to wake her, in case she made a noise and
alerted the guards.  She and her sister mounted the two horses while my
mother was fled onto the back of one of the horsemen, and they headed
off into the night.  The horsemen had been paid well, and ran fast.  By
dawn they were at Changli, and before the alarm could be given, they
had caught the train

54 "Three-Inch Golden Lilies' north.  When the train finally drew into
Yixian toward nightfall, my grandmother fell to the ground and lay
there for a long time, unable to move.

She was comparatively safe, 200 miles from Lulong and effectively out
of reach of the Xue household.  She could not take my mother to her
house, for fear of the servants, so she asked an old schoolfriend if
she could hide my mother.  The friend lived in the house of her
father-in-law, a Manchu doctor called Dr.  Xia, who was well known as a
kindly man who would never turn anyone away or betray a friend.

The Xue household would not care enough about my grandmother, a mere
concubine, to pursue her.  It was my mother, the blood descendant, who
mattered.  My grandmother sent a telegram to Lulong saying my mother
had fallen ill on the train and had died.  There followed an agonizing
wait, during which my grandmother's moods oscillated wildly.  Sometimes
she felt that the family must have believed her story.  But then she
would torment herself with the thought that this might not be the case,
and that they were sending thugs to drag her, or her daughter, back.
Finally she consoled herself with the thought that the Xue family was
far too preoccupied with the impending death of the patriarch to expend
energy worrying about her, and that it was probably to the women's
advantage not to have her daughter around.

Once she realized the Xue family was going to leave her alone, my
grandmother settled back quietly into her house in Yixian with my
mother.  She did not even worry about the servants, since she knew that
her 'husband' would not be coming.  The silence from Lulong lasted over
a year, until one autumn day in 1933, when a telegram arrived informing
her that General Xue had died, and that she was expected at Lulong
immediately for the funeral.

The general had died in Tianjin in September.  His body was brought
back to Lulong in a lacquered coffin covered with red embroidered silk.
Accompanying him were two other coffins, one similarly lacquered and
draped in the same red silk as his own, the other of plain wood with no
covering.  The first coffin contained the body of one of his
concubines, who had swallowed opium to accompany him in death.  This
was considered the height of conjugal loyalty.  Later a plaque
inscribed by the famous warlord Wu Pei-fu was put up in her honor in
General Xue's mansion.  The second coffin contained the remains of
another concubine, who had died of typhoid two years before.  Her
corpse had been exhumed for reburial alongside General Xue, as was the
custom.  Her coffin was of bare wood because, having died of a horrible
illness, she was considered ill fortune.  Mercury and charcoal had been
placed inside each of the coffins to prevent the corpses rotting, and
the bodies had pearls in their mouths.

General Xue and the two concubines were buried together in the same
tomb; his wife and the other concubines would eventually be interred
alongside them.  At a funeral, the essential duty of holding a special
flag for calling the spirit of the deceased had to be performed by the
dead man's son.  As the general had no son, his wife adopted his
ten-year-old nephew so he could carry out the task.  The boy also
enacted another ritual kneeling by the side of the coffin and calling
out "Avoid the nails!"  Tradition held that if this was not done, the
dead person would be hurt by the nails.

The tomb site had been chosen by General Xue himself according to the
principles of geomancy  It was in a beautiful, tranquil spot, backing
onto distant mountains to the north, while the front faced a stream set
among eucalyptus trees to the south.  This location expressed the
desire to have solid things behind on which to lean mountains and the
reflection of the glorious sun, symbolizing rising prosperity, in
front.

But my grandmother never saw the site: she had ignored her summons, and
was not at the funeral.  The next thing that happened was that the
manager of the pawnshop failed

56 "Three-Inch Golden Lilies' to turn up with her allowance.  About a
week later, her parents received a letter from General Xue's wife.  My
grandfather's last words had been to give my grandmother her freedom.
This, for its time, was exceptionally enlightened, and she could hardly
believe her good fortune.

At the age of twenty-four, she was free.

2. "Even Plain Cold Water Is Sweet'

My Grandmother Marries a

Manchu Doctor (lg$$-1938)

The letter from General Xue's wife also asked my grandmother's parents
to take her back.  Though the point was couched in the traditional
indirect manner, my grandmother knew that she was being ordered to move
OUt.

Her father took her in, but with considerable reluctance.

By now he had abandoned any pretense of being a family man.  From the
moment he had arranged the liaison with General Xue, he had risen in
the world.  As well as being promoted to deputy chief of the Yixian
police and entering the ranks of the well-connected, he had become
relatively rich, and had bought some land and taken up smoking opium.

No sooner had he been promoted than he acquired a concubine, a
Mongolian woman who was presented to him by his immediate boss.  Giving
a concubine as a present to an up-and-coming colleague was a common
practice, and the local police chief was happy to oblige a protege of
General Xue.  But my great-grandfather soon began casting around for
another concubine; it was good for a man in his position to have as
many as possible they showed a man's status.  He did not have to look
far: the concubine had a sister.

When my grandmother returned to her parents' house, the setup was quite
different from when she had left almost a decade before.  Instead of
just her unhappy, downtrodden mother, there were now three spouses. One
of the concubines had produced a daughter, who was the same age as my
mother.  My grandmother's sister, Lan, was still unmarried at the
advanced age of sixteen, which was a cause of irritation to Yang.

My grandmother had moved from one cauldron of intrigue into another.
Her father was resentful of both her and her mother.  He resented his
wife simply for being there, and he was even more unpleasant to her now
that he had the two concubines, whom he favored over her.  He took his
meals with the concubines, leaving his wife to eat on her own.  My
grandmother he resented for returning to the house when he had
successfully created a new world for himself.

He also regarded her as a jinx (kc), because she had lost her husband.
In those days, a woman whose husband had died was superstitiously held
responsible for his death.

My great-grandfather saw his daughter as bad luck, a threat to his good
fortune, and he wanted her out of the house.

The two concubines egged him on.  Before my grandmother came back, they
had been having things very much their own way.  My great-grandmother
was a gentle, even weak person.  Although she was theoretically the
superior of the concubines, she lived at the mercy of their whims.

In 193o she gave birth to a son, Yu-lin.  This deprived the concubines
of their future security, as on my great grandfather's death all his
property would automatically go to his son.  They would throw tantrums
if Yang showed any affection at all to his son.  From the moment Yu-lin
was born, they stepped up their psychological warfare against my
great-grandmother, freezing her out in her own house.

They only spoke to her to nag and complain, and if they looked at her
it was with cold stony faces.  My great grandmother got no support from
her husband, whose contempt for her was not pacified by the fact that
she had given him the son.  He found new ways to find fault with her.

My grandmother was a stronger character than her mother, and the misery
of the past decade had toughened her up.  Even her father was a little
in awe of her.  She told herself that the days of her subservience to
her father were over, and that she was going to fight for herself and
for her mother.  As long as she was in the house, the-concubines had to
restrain themselves, even presenting a toadying smile occasionally.

This was the atmosphere in which my mother lived the formative years
from two to four.  Though shielded by her mother's love, she could
sense the tension which pervaded the household.

My grandmother was now a beautiful young woman in her mid-twenties. She
was also highly accomplished, and several men asked her father for her
hand.  But because she had been a concubine, the only ones who offered
to take her as a proper wife were poor and did not stand a chance with
Mr.  Yang.

My grandmother had had enough of the spitefulness and petty
vengefulness of the concubine world, in which the only choice was
between being a victim and victimizing others.  There was no halfway
house.  All my grandmother wanted was to be left alone to bring up her
daughter in peace.

Her father was constantly badgering her to remarry, sometimes by
dropping unkind hints, at other times telling her outright she had to
take herselfoffhis hands.  But there was nowhere for her to go.  She
had no place to live, and she was not allowed to get a job.  After a
time, unable to stand the pressure, she had a nervous breakdown.

A doctor was called in.  It was Dr.  Xia, in whose house my mother had
been hidden three years before, after the escape from General Xue's
mansion.  Although she had been a friend of his daughter-in-law, Dr.
Xia had never seen my grandmother in keeping with the strict sexual
segregation prevalent at the time.  When he first walked into her room,
he was so struck by her beauty that in his confusion he backed straight
out again and mumbled to the servant that he felt unwell.  Eventually,
he recovered his composure and sat and talked to her at length.  He was
the first man she had ever met to whom she could say what she really
felt, and she poured out her grief and her hopes to him although with
restraint, as be fitted a woman talking to a man who was not her
husband.  The doctor was gentle and warm, and my grandmother had never
felt so understood.  Before long, the two fell in love, and Dr.  Xia
proposed.  Moreover, he told my grandmother that he wanted her to be
his proper wife, and to bring my mother up as his own daughter.  My
grandmother accepted, with tears of joy.  Her father was also happy,
although he was quick to point out to Dr.  Xia that he would not be
able to provide any dowry.  Dr.  Xia told him that was completely
irrelevant.

Dr.  Xia had built up a considerable practice in traditional medicine
in Yixian, and enjoyed a very high professional reputation.  He was not
a Han Chinese, as were the Yangs and most people in China, but a
Manchu, one of the origin aI inhabitants of Manchuria.  At one time his
family had been court doctors for the Manchu emperors, and had been
honored for their services.

Dr.  Xia was well known not only as an excellent doctor, but also as a
very kind man, who often treated poor people for nothing.  He was a big
man, over six feet tall, but he moved elegantly, in spite of his size.
He always dressed in traditional long robes and jacket.  He had gentle
brown eyes, and a goatee and a long drooping mustache.  His face and
his whole posture exuded calm.

My Grandmother Marries a Manchu Doctor 61 The doctor was already an
elderly man when he proposed to my grandmother.  He was sixty-five, and
a widower, with three grown-up sons and one daughter, all of them
married.  The three sons lived in the house with him.

The eldest looked after the household and managed the family farm, the
second worked in his father's practice, and the third, who was married
to my grandmother's schoolfriend, was a teacher.  Between them the sons
had eight children, one of whom was married and had a son himself.

Dr.  Xia called his sons into his study and told them about his plans.
They stole disbelieving, leaden glances at one another.  There was a
heavy silence.  Then the eldest spoke:

"I presume, Father, you mean she will be a concubine."  Dr.  Xia
replied that he was going to take my grandmother as a proper wife. 
This had tremendous implications, as she would become their stepmother,
and would have to be treated as a member of the older generation, with
venerable status on a par with her husband.  In an ordinary Chinese
household the younger generations had to be subservient to the older,
with suitable decorum to mark their relative positions, but Dr.  Xia
adhered to an even more complicated Manchu system of etiquette.  The
younger generations had to pay their respects to the older every
morning and evening, the men kneeling and the women curtsying.  At
festivals, the men had to do a full kowtow.  The fact that my
grandmother had been a concubine, plus the age gap, which meant they
would have to do obeisance to someone with an inferior status and much
younger than themselves, was too much for the sons.

They got together with the rest of the family and worked themselves up
into a state of outrage.  Even the daughterin-law who was my
grandmother's old schoolfriend was upset, as her father-in-law's
marriage would force her into a radically new relationship with someone
who had been her classmate.  She would not be able to eat at the same
table as her old friend, or even sit down with her; she

would have to wait on her hand and foot, and even kowtow to her.

Each member of the family sons, daughters-in-law, grandchildren, even
the great-grandson went in turn to beg Dr.  Xia to 'consider the
feelings' of his 'own flesh and blood."  They went down on their knees,
they prostrated themstelves in a full kowtow, they wept and screamed.

They begged Dr.  Xia to consider the fact that he was a Manchu, and
that according to ancient Manchu custom a man of his status should not
marry a Han Chinese.  Dr.  Xia replied that the rule had been abolished
a long time before.

His children said that if he was a good Manchu, he should observe it
anyway.  They went on and on about the age gap.

Dr.  Xia was more than twice my grandmother's age.  One of the family
trotted out an ancient saying: "A young wife who has an old husband is
really another man's woman."

What hurt Dr.  Xia more was the emotional blackmail especially the
argument that taking an ex-concubine as a proper wife would affect his
children's position in society.

He knew his children would lose face, and he felt guilty about this.
But Dr.  Xia felt he had to put my grandmother's happiness first.  If
he took her as a concubine, she would not merely lose face, she would
become the slave of the whole family.  His love alone would not be
enough to protect her if she was not his proper wife.

Dr.  Xia implored his family to grant an old man's wish.

But they and society took the attitude that an irresponsible wish
should not be indulged.  Some hinted that he was senile.  Others told
him: "You already have sons, grandsons, and even a great-grandson, a
big and prosperous family.  What more do you want?  Why do you have to
marry her?"

The arguments went on and on.  More and more relatives and friends
appeared on the scene, all invited by the sons.  They unanimously
pronounced the marriage to be an insane idea.  Then they turned their
venom against my grandmother.

"Marrying again when her late husband's body and bones are not yet
cold!"

"That woman has it all worked out: she is refusing to accept concubine
status so that she can become a proper wife.  If she really loves you,
why can't she be satisfied with being your concubine?"

They attributed motives to my grandmother: she was scheming to get Dr.
Xia to marry her, and would then take over the family and ill-treat his
children and grandchildren.

They also insinuated that she was plotting to lay her hands on Dr.
Xia's money.  Underneath all their talk about propriety, morality, and
Dr.  Xia's own good, there was an unspoken calculation involving his
assets.  The relatives feared my grandmother might lay her hands on Dr.
Xia's wealth, as she would automatically become the manageress of the
household as his wife.

Dr.  Xia was a rich man.  He owned 2,000 acres of farmland dotted
around the county of Yixian, and even had some land south of the Great
Wall.  His large house in the town was built of gray bricks stylishly
outlined in white paint.  Its ceilings were whitewashed and the rooms
were wallpapered, so that the beams and joints were concealed, which
was considered an important indicator of prosperity.

He also owned a flourishing medical practice and a medicine shop.

When the family saw they were getting nowhere, they decided to work on
my grandmother directly.  One day the daughter-in-law who had been at
school with her paid a call.  After tea and social chitchat, the friend
got around to her mission.  My grandmother burst into tears, and took
her by the hand in their usual intimate manner.  What would she do if
she were in her position, she asked.  When she got no reply, she
pressed on: "You know what being a concubine is like.  You wouldn't
like to be one, would you?

You know, there is an expression of Confucius: "Jiang-xinbi-xin Imagine
my heart was yours"!"  Appealing to someone's better instincts with a
precept from the sage sometimes worked better than a direct no.

The friend went back to her family feeling quite guilty,

and reported her failure.  She hinted that she did not have the heart
to push my grandmother anymore.  She found an ally in De-gui, Dr. Xia's
second son, who practiced medic Me with his father, and was closer to
him than his brothers.  He said he thought they should let the marriage
go ahead.  The third son also began to weaken when he heard his wife
describe my grandmother's distress.

The ones who were most indignant were the eldest son and his wife. When
she saw that the other two sons were wavering, the eldest son's wife
said to her husband: "Of course they don't care.  They've got other
jobs.  That woman can't take those away from them.  But what have you
got?  You are only the manager of the old man's estate and it will all
go to her and her daughter!  What will become of poor me and our poor
children?  We have nothing to fall back on.  Perhaps we should all die!
Perhaps that is what your father really wants!  Perhaps I should kill
myself to make them all happy!"  All this was accompanied by wailing
and floods of tears.  Her husband replied in an agitated manner: "Just
give me fill tomorrow."

When Dr.  Xia woke the next morning he found his entire family, with
the sole exception of De-gui, fifteen people in all, kneeling outside
his bedchamber.  The moment he emerged, his eldest son shouted
"Kowtow!"  and they all prostrated themselves in unison.  Then, in a
voice quaking with emotion, the son declaimed: "Father, your children
and your entire family will stay here and kowtow to you till our deaths
unless you start to think of us, your family and, above all, your
elderly self."

Dr.  Xia was so angry his whole body shook.  He asked his children to
stand up, but before anyone could move the eldest son spoke again: "No,
Father, we won't- not unless you call off the wedding!"  Dr.  Xia tried
to reason with him, but the son continued to hector him in a quivering
voice.  Finally Dr.  Xia said: "I know what is on your minds.  I won't
be in this world much longer.  If you are worried about how your future
stepmother will behave, I

b have not the slightest doubt that she will treat you all very well. 
I know she is a good person. Surely you can see there is no other
reassurance I can give you except her character..."

At the mention of the word 'character," the eldest son gave a loud
snort: "How can you mention the word "character" about a concubine!  No
good woman would have become a concubine in the first place!"  He then
started to abuse my grandmother.  At this, Dr.  Xia could not control
himself.  He lifted his walking stick and began thrashing his son.

All his life Dr.  Xia had been the epitome of restraint and calm.  The
whole family, still on their knees, was stunned.  The great-grandson
started screaming hysterically.  The eldest son was dumbstruck, but
only for a second; then he raised his voice again, not only from
physical hurt, but also for his wounded pride at being beaten in front
of his family.  Dr.  Xia stopped, short of breath from anger and
exertion.  At once the son started bellowing more abuse against my
grandmother.  His father shouted at him to shut up, and struck him so
hard his walking stick broke in two.

The son reflected on his humiliation and pain for a few seconds.  Then
he pulled out a pistol and looked Dr.  Xia in the face.

"A loyal subject uses his death to remonstrate with the emperor.  A
filial son should do the same with his father.  All I have to
remonstrate with you is my death!"  A shot rang out.  The son swayed,
then keeled over onto the floor.  He had fired a bullet into his
abdomen.

A horse-drawn cart rushed him to a nearby hospital, where he died the
next day.  He probably had not intended to kill himself, just to make a
dramatic gesture so the pressure on his father would be irresistible.

His son's death devastated Dr.  Xia.  Although outwardly he appeared
calm as usual, people who knew him could see that his tranquillity had
become scarred with a deep sadness.  From then on he was subject to
bouts of melancholy, very much out of character with his previous
imperturbability.

Yixian was boiling with indignafon, rumor, and accusations.  Dr.  Xia
and particularly my grandmother were made to feel responsible for the
death.  Dr.  Xia wanted to show he was not going to be deterred.  Soon
after the funeral of his son, he fixed a date for the wedding.  He
warned his children that they must pay due respect to their new mother,
and sent out invitations to the leading townspeople.  Custom dictated
that they should attend and give presents.  He also told my grandmother
to prepare for a big ceremony.  She was frightened by the accusations
and their unforeseeable effect on Dr.  Xia, and was desperately trying
to convince herself that she was not guilty.  But, above all, she felt
defiant.  She consented to a full ceremonial ritual.  On the wedding
day she left her father's house in an elaborate carriage accompanied by
a procession of musicians.  As was the Manchu custom, her own family
hired the carriage to take her halfway to her new home, and the
bridegroom sent another to carry her the second half of the way.  At
the han dover point, her five year-old brother, Yu-lin, waited at the
foot of the carriage door with his back bent double, symboli?ing the
idea that he was carrying her on his back to Dr.  Xia's carriage.  He
repeated the action when she arrived at Dr.  Xia's house.  A woman
could not just walk into a man's house; this would imply a severe loss
of status.  She had to be seen to be taken, to denote the requisite
reluctance.

Two bridesmaids led my grandmother into the room where the wedding
ceremony was to take place.  Dr.  Xia was standing before a table
draped with heavy red embroidered silk on which lay the tablets of
Heaven, Earth,

Emperor, Ancestors, and Teacher.  He was wearing a decorated hat like a
crown with a tail-like plumage at the back and a long, loose,
embroidered gown with bell-shaped sleeves, a traditional Manchu
garment, convenient for riding and archery, deriving from the Manchus'
nomadic

past.  He knelt and kowtowed five times to the tablets and then walked
into the wedding chamber alone.

Next my grandmother, still accompanied by her two attendants, curtsied
five times, each time touching her hair with her right hand, in a
gesture resembling a salute.  She could not kowtow because of the mass
of her elaborate headdress.  She then followed Dr.  Xia into the
wedding chamber, where he removed the red cover from her head.

The two bridesmaids presented each of them with an empty gourd-shaped
vase, which they exchanged with each other, and then the bridesmaids
left.  Dr.  Xia and my grandmother sat silently alone together for a
while, and then Dr.  Xia went out to greet the relatives and guests. My
grandmother had to sit, motionless and alone, on the kang, facing the
window on which was a huge red 'double happiness' paper cut, for
several hours.  This was called 'sitting happiness in," symbolizing the
absence of restlessness that was deemed to be an essential quality for
a woman.  After all the guests had gone, a young male relative of Dr.
Xia's came in and tugged her by the sleeve three times.  Only then was
she allowed to get down from the kang.  With the help of her two
attendants, she changed out of her heavily embroidered outfit into a
simple red gown and red trousers.  She removed the enormous headdress
with all the clicking jewels and did her hair in two coils above her
ears.

So in 1935 my mother, now age four, and my grandmother, age twenty-six,
moved into Dr.  Xia's comfortable house.  It was really a compound all
on its own, consisting of the house proper in the interior and the
surgery, with the medicine shop, facing onto the street.  It was
customary for successful doctors to have their own shops.  Here Dr. Xia
sold traditional Chinese medicines, herbs and animal extracts, which
were processed in a workshop by three apprentices.

The facade of the house was surmounted by highly decorated red and gold
eaves.  In the center was a rectangular plaque denoting the Xia
residence in gilded characters.  Behind the shop lay a small courtyard,
with a number of rooms opening off it for the servants and cooks.

Beyond that the compound opened out into several smaller courtyards,
where the family lived.  Farther back was a big garden with cypresses
and winter plums.  There was no grass in the courtyards the climate was
too harsh.  They were just expanses of hard, bare, brown earth, which
turned to dust in the summer and to mud in the brief spring when the
snow melted.  Dr.  Xia loved birds and had a bird garden, and every
morning, whatever the weather, he did qigong, a form of the slow,
graceful Chinse exercises often called tai chi, while he listened to
the birds singing and chirping.

After the death of his son, Dr.  Xia had to endure the constant silent
reproach of his family.  He never talked to my grandmother about the
pain this caused him.  For

Chinese men a stiff upper lip was mandatory.  My grandmother knew what
he was going through, of course, and suffered with him, in silence. She
was very loving toward him, and attended to his needs with all her
heart.

She always showed a smiling face to his family, although they generally
treated her with disdain beneath a veneer of formal respect.  Even the
daughter-in-law who had been at school with her tried to avoid her. The
knowledge that she was held responsible for the eldest son's death
weighed on my grandmother.

Her entire lifestyle had to change to that of a Manchu.

She slept in a room with my mother, and Dr.  Xia slept in a separate
room.  Early every morning, long before she got up, her nerves would
start to strain and jangle, anticipating the noise of the family
members approaching.  She had to wash hurriedly, and greet each of them
in turn with a rigid set of salutations.  In addition, she had to do
her hair in an extremely complicated way so that it could support a
huge headdress, under which she had to wear a wig.  All she got was a
sequence of icy "Good morning's, virtually the only words the family
ever spoke to her.  As she watched them bowing and scraping, she knew
they had hate in their hearts.  The ritual grated all the more for its
insincerity.

On festivals and other important occasions, the whole family had to
kowtow and curtsy to her, and she would have to jump up from her chair
and stand to one side to show that she had left the chair empty, which
symbolized their late mother, to acknowledge their respect.  Manchu
custom conspired to keep her and Dr.  Xia apart.  They were not
supposed even to eat together, and one of the daughters-in-law always
stood behind my grandmother to serve her.  But the woman would present
such a cold face that my grandmother found it difficult to finish her
meal, much less enjoy it.

Once, soon after they had moved into Dr.  Xia's house, my mother had
just settled down into what looked like a nice, comfortable, warm place
on the kang when she saw Dr.  Xia's face suddenly darken, and he
stormed over and roughly pulled her off the seat.  She had sat in his
special place.  This was the only time he ever hit her.  According to
Manchu custom, his seat was sacred.

The move to Dr.  Xia's house brought my grandmother a real measure of
freedom for the first time but also a degree of entrapment.  For my
mother it was no less ambivalent.  Dr.  Xia was extremely kind to her
and brought her x~p as his own daughter.  She called him "Father," and
he gave her his own name, Xia, which she carries to this day and a new
given name, "De-hong," which is made up of two characters: Hong,
meaning 'wild swan," and De, the generation name, meaning 'virtue."

Dr.  Xia's family did not dare insult my grandmother to her face that
would have been tantamount to treason to one's 'mother."  But her
daughter was another matter.  My mother's first memories, apart from
being cuddled by her mother, are of being bullied by the younger
members of Dr.  Xia's family.  She would try not to cry out, and to
hide her bruises and cuts from her mother, but my grandmother knew what
was going on.  She never said anything to Dr.  Xia, as she did not want
to upset him or create more problems for him with his children.  But my
mother was miserable.  She often begged to be taken back to her
grandparents' house, or to the house General Xue had bought, where
everyone had treated her like a princess.  But she soon realized she
should stop asking to 'go home," as this only brought tears to her
mother's eyes.

My mother's closest friends were her pets.  She had an owl, a black
myna bird which could say a few simple phrases, a hawk, a cat, white
mice, and some grasshoppers and crickets which she kept in glass
bottles.  Apart from her mother, her only close human friend was Dr.
Xia's coachman, "Big Old Lee."  He was a tough, leathery-skinned man
from the Hinggan mountains in the far north, where the borders of
China, Mongolia, and the Soviet Union meet.

He had very dark skin, coarse hair, thick lips, and an upturned nose,
all of which are very unusual among Chinese.  In fact, he did not look
Chinese at all.  He was tall, thin, and wiry.  His father had brought
him up as a hunter and trapper, digging out ginseng roots and hunting
bears, foxes, and deer.  For a time they had done very well selling the
skins, but they had eventually been put out of business by bandits, the
worst of whom worked for the Old Marshal, Chang Tso-lin.  Big Old Lee
referred to him as 'that bandit bastard."  Later, when my mother was
told the Old Marshal had been a staunch anti-Japanese patriot, she
remembered Big Old Lee's mockery of the 'hero' of the northeast.

Big Old Lee looked after my mother's pets, and used to take her out on
expeditions with him.  That winter he taught her to skate.  In the
spring, as the snow and ice were melting, they watched people
performing the important annual ritual of 'sweeping the tombs' and
planting flowers on the graves of their ancestors.  In summer they went
fishing and

My Grandmother Marries a Manchu Doctor 71 gathering mushrooms, and in
the autumn they drove out to the edge of town to shoot hares.

In the long Manchurian evenings, when the wind howled across the plains
and the ice froze on the inside of the windows, Big Old Lee would sit
my mother on his knee on the warm kang and tell her fabulous stories
about the mountains of the north.  The images she took to bed were of
mysterious tall trees, exotic flowers, colorful birds singing tuneful
songs, and ginseng roots which were really lit He girls after you dug
them out you had to tie a red string around them, otherwise they would
run away.

Big Old Lee also told my mother about animal lore.

Tigers, which roamed the mountains of northern Manchuria, were
kind-hearted and would not hurt human beings unless they felt
threatened.  He loved tigers.  But bears were another matter: they were
fierce and one should avoid them at all costs.  If you did happen to
meet one, you must stand still until it lowered its head.  This was
because the bear has a lock of hair on his forehead which falls over
his eyes and blinds him when he drops his head.  With a wolf you should
not turn and run, because you could never outrun it.  You should stand
and face it head-on, looking as though you were not afraid.  Then you
should walk backwards very, very slowly.  Many years later, Big Old
Lee's advice was to save my mother's life.

One day when she was five years old my mother was in the garden talking
to her pets when Dr.  Xia's grandchildren crowded around her in a gang.
They started jostling her and calling her names, and then began to hit
her and shove her around more violently.  They forced her into a corner
of the garden where there was a dried-up well and pushed her in.  The
well was quite deep, and she fell hard on the rubble at the bottom.
Eventually someone heard her screams and called Big Old Lee, who came
running with a ladder; the cook held it steady while he climbed in.  By
now my grandmother had arrived, frantic with worry.  After a few
minutes, Big Old Lee resurfaced carrying my mother, who was half
unconscious and covered with cuts and bruises.  He put her in my
grandmother's arms.  My mother was taken inside, where Dr.  Xia
examined her.

One hipbone was broken.  For years afterward it sometimes became
dislocated and the accident left her with a permanent slight limp..

When Dr.  Xia asked her what had happened, my mother said she had been
pushed by "Number Six [Grandson]."

My grandmother, ever attentive to Dr.  Xia's moods, tried to shush her
up because Number Six was his favorite.

When Dr.  Xia left the room, my grandmother told my mother not to
complain about "Number Six' again, so as not to upset Dr.  Xia.  For
some time my mother was confined to the house because of her hip.  The
other children ostracized her completely.

Immediately after this, Dr.  Xia began to go away for several days at a
time.  He went to the provincial capital,

Jinzhou, about twenty-five miles to the south, looking for a job.  The
atmosphere in the family was unbearable, and my mother's accident,
which might easily have been fatal, convinced him that a move was
essential.

This was no small decision.  In China, to have several generations of a
family living under one roof was considered a great honor.  Streets
even had names like "Five

Generations Under One Roof' to commemorate such families.  Breaking up
the extended family was viewed as a tragedy to be avoided at all costs,
but Dr.  Xia tried to put on a cheerful face to my grandmother, saying
he would be glad to have less responsibility.

My grandmother was vastly relieved, although she tried not to show it.
In fact, she had been gently pushing Dr.  Xia to move, especially after
what happened to my mother.  She had had enough of the extended family,
always glacially present, icily willing her to be miserable, and in
which she had neither privacy nor company.

Dr.  Xia divided his property up among the members of his family.  The
only things he kept for himself were the gifts which had been bestowed
on his ancestors by the Manchu emperors.  To the widow of his eldest
son he gave all his land.  The second son inherited the medicine shop,
and the house was left to his youngest son.  He saw to it that Big Old
Lee and the other servants were well taken care of.  When he asked my
grandmother if she would mind being poor, she said she would be happy
just to have her daughter and himself: "If you have love, even plain
cold water is sweet."

On a freezing December day in 1936 the family gathered outside the
front gate to see them off.  They were all dry eyed except De-gui, the
only son who had backed the marriage.  Big Old Lee drove them in the
horse-drawn carriage to the station, where my mother said a tearful
goodbye to him.  But she became excited when they got on the train.
This was the first time she had been on a train since she was a year
old and she was thrilled, jumping up and down as she looked out the
window.

Jinzhou was a big city, with a population of almost 100,000, the
capital of one of the nine provinces of Manchukuo.  It lies about ten
miles inland from the sea, where Manchuria approaches the Great Wall.
Like Yixian, it was a walled town, but it was growing fast and had
already spread well beyond its walls.  It boasted a number of textile
factories and two oil refineries; it was an important railroad
junction, and even had its own airport.

The Japanese had occupied it in early January 1932, after heavy
fighting.  Jinzhou was in a highly strategic location, and had played a
central role in the takeover of Manchuria, its seizure becoming the
focus of a major diplomatic dispute between the United States and Japan
and a key episode in the long chain of events which ultimately led to
Pearl Harbor ten years later.

when the Japanese began their attack on Manchuria in September 193 i,
the Young Marshal, Chang Hsueh-liang, was forced to abandon his
capital, Mukden, to the Japanese.  He decamped to Jinzhou with some
200,000 troops and set up his headquarters there.  In one of the first
such attacks in history, the Japanese bombed the city from the air.
When the Japanese troops entered Jinzhou they went on a rampage.

This was the town where Dr.  Xia, now age sixty-six, had to start again
from the bottom.  He could only afford to rent a mud hut about ten by
eight feet in size in a very poor part of town, a low-lying area by a
river, under a levee.  Most of the local shack owners were too poor to
afford a proper roof: they laid pieces of corrugated iron over their
four walls and put heavy stones on top to try to stop them from being
blown away in the frequent high winds.  The area was right on the edge
of the town on the other side of the river were sorghum fields.  When
they first arrived in December, the brown earth was frozen solid and so
was the river, which was about thirty yards wide at this point.  In the
spring, as the ice thawed, the ground around the hut turned to a
quagmire, and the stench of sewage, kept down in winter because it
immediately froze, permanently lodged in their nostrils.  In the summer
the area was infested with mosquitoes, and floods were a constant worry
because the river rose well above the level of the houses and the
embankments were poorly maintained.

My mother's overwhelming impression was of almost unbearable cold.
Every activity, not just sleeping, had to take place on the kang, which
took up most of the space in the hut, apart from a small stove in one
corner.  All three of them had to sleep together on the kang.  There
was no electricity or running water.  The toilet was a mud shack with a
communal pit.

Right opposite the house was a brightly painted temple dedicated to the
God of Fire.  People coming to pray in it would tie their horses up in
front of the Xias' shack.  When it got warmer, Dr.  Xia would take my
mother for walks along the riverbank in the evenings and recite
classical poetry to her, against the background of the magnificent
sunsets.  My grandmother would not accompany them:

there was no custom of husbands and wives taking walks together, and in
any case, her bound feet meant that walking could never be a pleasure
for her.

They were on the edge of starvation.  In Yixian the family had had a
supply of food from Dr.  Xia's own land, which meant they always had
some rice even after the Japanese had taken their cut.  Now their
income was sharply down and the Japanese were appropriating a far
greater proportion of the available food.  Much of what was produced
locally was forcibly exported to Japan, and the large Japanese army in
Manchuria took most of the remaining rice and wheat for itself.  The
local population could occasionally get hold of some maize or sorghum,
but even these were scarce.  The main food was acorn meal, which tasted
and smelled revolting.

My grandmother had never experienced such poverty, but this was the
happiest time of her life.  Dr.  Xia loved her, and she had her
daughter with her all the 6me.  She was no longer forced to go through
any of the tedious Manchu rituals, and the tiny mud hut was filled with
laughter.  She and Dr.  Xia sometimes passed the long evenings playing
cards.  The rules were that if Dr.  Xia lost, my grandmother would
smack him three times, and if she lost, Dr.  Xia would kiss her three
times.

My grandmother had many women friends in the neighborhood, which was
something new for her.  As the wife of a doctor she was respected, even
though he was not well off.  After years of being humiliated and
treated as chattel, she was now truly surrounded by freedom.

Every now and then she and her friends would put on an old Manchu
performance for themselves, playing hand drums while they sang and
danced.  The tunes they played consisted of very simple, repetitive
notes and rhythms, and the women made up the lyrics as they went along.
The married women sang about their sex lives, and the virgins asked
questions about sex.  Being mostly illiterate, the women used this as a
way to learn about the facts of life.

Through their singing, they also talked to each other about their lives
and their husbands, and passed on their gossip.

My grandmother loved these gatherings, and would often practice for
them at home.  She would sit on the kang, shaking the hand drum with
her left hand and singing to the beat, composing the lyrics as she went
along.  Often Dr.  Xia would suggest words.  My mother was too young to
be taken along to the gatherings, but she could watch my grandmother
rehearsing.  She was fascinated and parfcularly wanted to know what
words Dr.  Xia had suggested.

She knew they must be great fun, because he and her mother laughed so
much.  But when her mother repeated them for her, she 'fell into clouds
and fog."  She had no idea what they meant.

But life was tough.  Every day was a battle just to survive.

Rice and wheat were only available on the black market, so my
grandmother began selling off some of the jewelry

General Xue had given her.  She ate almost nothing herself, saying she
had already eaten, or that she was not hungry and would eat later. When
Dr.  Xia found out she was selling her jewelry, he insisted she stop:
"I am an old man," he said.

"Some day I will die, and you will have to rely on those jewels to
survive."

Dr.  Xia was working as a salaried doctor attached to another man's
medicine shop, which did not give him much chance to display his skill.
But he worked hard, and gradually his reputation began to grow.  Soon
he was invited to go on his first visit to a patient's home.  When he
came back that evening he was carrying a package wrapped in a cloth. He
winked at my mother and his wife and asked them to guess what was
inside the package.  My mother's eyes were glued to the steaming
bundle, and even before she could shout out "Steamed rolls!"  she was
already tearing the package open.  As she was devouring the rolls, she
looked up and met Dr.  Xia's twinkling eyes.  More than fifty years
later she can still remember his look of happiness,

My Grandmother Mama a Manchu Doctor 77 and even today she says she
cannot remember any tbod as delicious as those simple wheat rolls.

Home visits were important to doctors, because the families would pay
the doctor who made the call rather than his employer.  When the
patients were happy, or rich, the doctors would often be given handsome
rewards.

Grateful patients would also give doctors valuable presents at New Year
and on other special occasions.  After a number of home visits, Dr.
Xia's circumstances began to improve.

His reputation began to spread, too.  One day the wife of the
provincial governor fell into a coma, and he called in Dr.  Xia, who
managed to restore her to consciousness.

This was considered almost the equivalent of bringing a person back
from the grave.  The governor ordered a plaque to be made on which he
wrote in his own hand:

"Dr.  Xia, who gives life to people and society."  He ordered the
plaque to be carried through the town in procession.

Soon afterward the governor came to Dr.  Xia for a different kind of
help.  He had one wife and twelve concubines, but not one of them had
borne him a child.  The governor had heard that Dr.  Xia was
particularly skilled in questions of fertility.  Dr.  Xia prescribed
potions for the governor and his thirteen consorts, several of whom
became pregnant.

In fact, the problem had been the governor's, but the diplomatic Dr.
Xia treated the wife and the concubines as well.

The governor was overjoyed, and wrote an even larger plaque for Dr. Xia
inscribed: "The reincarnation of Kuanyin' (the Buddhist goddess of
fertility and kindness).  The new plaque was carried to Dr.  Xia's
house with an even larger procession than the first one.  After this,
people came to see Dr.  Xia from as far away as Harbin, 400 miles to
the north.  He became known as one of the 'four famous doctors' of
Manchukuo.

By the end of 1937, a year after they had arrived in Jinzhou, Dr.  Xia
was able to move to a bigger house just outside the old north gate of
the city.  It was far superior to the shack by the river.  Instead of
mud, it was made of red brick.  Instead of one room, it had no fewer
than three bedrooms.  Dr.  Xia was able to set up his own practice
again, and used the sitting room as his surgery.

The house occupied the south side of a big courtyard which was shared
with two other families, but only Dr.  Xia's house had a door which
opened directly into it.  The other two houses faced out onto the
street and had solid walls on the courtyard side, without even a window
looking onto it.  When they wanted to get into the courtyard they had
to go around through a gate from the street.  The north side of the
courtyard was a solid wall.  In the courtyard were cypresses and
Chinese ilex trees on which the three families used to hang up
clotheslines.  There were also some roses of Sharon, which were tough
enough to survive the harsh winters.  During the summer my grandmother
would put out her favorite annuals: white-edged morning glory,
chrysanthemums, dahlias, and garden balsam.

My grandmother and Dr.  Xia never had any children together.  He
subscribed to a theory that a man over the age of sixty-five should not
ejaculate, so as to conserve his sperm, which was considered the
essence of a man.  Years later my grandmother told my mother, somewhat
mysteriously, that through qigong Dr.  Xia developed a technique which
enabled him to have an orgasm without ejaculating.

For a man of his age he enjoyed extraordinary health.  He was never
ill, and took a cold shower every day, even in temperatures of minus io
F. He never touched alcohol or tobacco, in keeping with the injunctions
of the quasi religious sect to which he belonged, the Zai-li-hui
(Society of Reason).

Although he was a doctor himself, Dr.  Xia was not keen on taking
medicine, insisting that the way to good health was a sound body.  He
adamantly opposed any treatment which in his opinion cured one part of
the body while doing damage to another, and would not use strong
medicines because of the side effects they might have.  My mother and
grandmother often had to take medicines behind his back.  When they did
fall ill, he would always bring in another doctor, who was a
traditional Chinese doctor but also a shaman and believed that some
ailments were caused by evil spirits, which had to be placated or
exorcized by special religious techniques.

My mother was happy.  For the first time in her life she felt warmth
all around her.  No longer did she feel tension, as she had for the two
years at her grandparents', and there was none of the bullying she had
undergone for a whole year from Dr.  Xia's grandchildren.

She was particularly excited by the festivals which came around almost
every month.  There was no concept of the workweek among ordinary
Chinese.  Only government offices, schools, and Japanese factories had
a day off on Sunday.  For other people only festivals provided a break
from the daily routine.

On the twenty-third day of the twelfth moon, seven days before the
Chinese New Year, the Winter Festival began.

According to legend, this was the day when the Kitchen God, who had
been living above the stove with his wife, in the form of their
portraits, went up to Heaven to report on the behavior of the family to
the Celestial Emperor.  A good report would bring the family abundant
food in the kitchen in the coming year.  So on this day every household
would busily kowtow to the portraits of Lord and Lady Kitchen God
before they were set ablaze to signify their ascent to Heaven.
Grandmother would always ask my mother to stick some honey on their
lips.  She would also burn lifelike miniature horses and figures of
servants which she made out of sorghum plants so the royal couple would
have extra special service to make them happier and thus more inclined
to say many nice things about the Xias to the Celestial Emperor.

The next few days were spent preparing all sons of food.

Meat was cut into special shapes, and rice and soybeans were ground
into powder and made into buns, rolls, and dumplings.  The food was put
into the cellar to wait for the New Year.  With the temperature as low
as minus 2o F, the cellar was a natural refrigerator.

At midnight on Chinese New Year's Eve, a huge burst of fireworks was
let off, to my mother's great excitement.

She would follow her mother and Dr.  Xia outside and kowtow in the
direction from which the God of Fortune was supposed to be coming.  All
along the street, people were doing the same.  Then they would greet
each other with the words "May you run into good fortune."

At Chinese New Year people gave each other presents.

When dawn lit up the white paper in the windows to the east, my mother
would jump out of bed and hurry into her new finery: new jacket, new
trousers, new socks, and new shoes.  Then she and her mother called on
neighbors and friends, kowtowing to all the adults.  For every bang of
her head on the floor, she got a 'red wrapper' with money inside. These
packets were to last her the whole year as pocket money.

For the next fifteen days, the adults went round paying visits and
wishing each other good fortune.  Good fortune, namely money, was an
obsession with most ordinary Chinese.  People were poor, and in the Xia
household, like many others, the only time meat was in reasonably
abundant supply was at festival time.

The festivities would culminate on the fifteenth day with a carnival
procession followed by a lantern show after dark.

The procession centered on an inspection visit by the God of Fire.  The
god would be carried around the neighborhood to warn people of the
danger of fire; with most houses partly made of timber and the climate
dry and windy, fire was a constant hazard and source of terror, and the
statue of the god in the temple used to receive offerings all year
round.  The procession started at the temple of the God of Fire, in
front of the mud hut where the Xias had lived when they first came to
Jinzhou.  A replica of the statue, a

My Grandmother Marries a Manchu Doctor 8 I giant with red hair, beard,
eyebrows, and cloak, was carried on an open sedan chair by eight young
men.  It was followed by writhing dragons and lions, each made up of
several men, and by floats, stilts, and yangge dancers who waved the
ends of a long piece of colorful silk tied around their waists.
Fireworks, drums, and cymbals made a thundering noise.  My mother
skipped along behind the procession.

Almost every household displayed tantalizing foods along the route as
offerings to the deity, but she noticed that the deity jolted by rather
quickly, not touching any of it.

"Goodwill for the gods, offerings for the human stomachs!"

her mother told her.  In those days of scarcity my mother looked
forward keenly to the festivals, when she could satisfy her stomach.
She was quite indifferent to those occasions which had poetic rather
than gastronomic associations, and would wait impatiently for her
mother to guess the riddles stuck on the splendid lanterns hung at
people's front doors during the Lantern Festival, or for her mother to
tour the chrysanthemums in people's gardens on the ninth day of the
ninth moon.

During the Fair of the Town God's Temple one year, my grandmother
showed her a row of clay sculptures in the temple, all redecorated and
painted for the occasion.

They were scenes of Hell, showing people being punished for their sins.
My grandmother pointed out a clay figure whose tongue was being pulled
out at least a foot while simultaneously being cut up by two devils
with spiky hair standing on end like hedgehogs and eyes bulging like
frogs.

The man being tortured had been a liar in his previous life, she said
and this was what would happen to my mother if she told lies.

There were about a dozen groups of statues, set amid the buzzing crowds
and the mouth-watering food stalls, each one illustrating a moral
lesson.  My grandmother cheerfully showed my mother one horrible scene
after another, but when they came to one group of figures she whisked
her by without any explanation.  Only some years later did my mother
find out that it depicted a woman being sawed in half by two men.  The
woman was a widow who had remarried, and she was being sawed in half by
her two husbands because she had been the property of both of them.  In
those days many widows were frightened by this prospect and remained
loyal to their dead husbands, no matter how much misery that entailed.
Some even killed themselves if they were forced by their families to
remarry.

My mother realized that her mother's decision to marry Dr.  Xia had not
been an easy one.

3. "They All Say What a Happy Place Manchukuo Is' Life under the
Japanese

(1938-1945)

Early in 1938, my mother was nearly seven.  She was very bright, and
very keen to study.  Her parents thought she should begin school as
soon as the new school year started, immediately after Chinese New
Year.

Education was tightly controlled by the Japanese, especially the
history and ethics courses.  Japanese, not Chinese, was the official
language in the schools.  Above the fourth form in elementary school
teaching was entirely in Japanese, and most of the teachers were
Japanese.

On 11 September 1939, when my mother was in her second year in
elementary school, the emperor of Manchukuo, Pu Yi, and his wife came
to Jinzhou on an official visit.  My mother was chosen to present
flowers to the empress on her arrival.  A large crowd stood on a gaily
decorated dais, all holding yellow paper flags in the colors of
Manchukuo.  My mother was given a huge bouquet of flowers, and she was
full of self-confidence as she stood next to the brass band and a group
of VIPs in morning coats.  A boy about the same age as my mother was
standing

84 "They All Say What a Happy Place Manchukuo Is' stiffly near her with
a bouquet of flowers to present to Pu Yi.  As the royal couple appeared
the band struck up the Manchukuo national anthem.  Everyone sprang to
attention.  My mother stepped forward and curtsied, expertly balancing
her bouquet.  The empress was wearing a white dress and very fine long
white gloves up to her elbows.

My mother thought she looked extremely beautiful.  She managed to
snatch a glance at Pu Yi, who was in military uniform.  Behind his
thick spectacles she thought he had 'piggy eyes."

Apart from the fact that she was a star pupil, one reason my mother was
chosen to present flowers to the empress was that she always filled in
her nationality on registration forms as "Manchu," like Dr.  Xia, and
Manchukuo was supposed to be the Manchus' own independent state.  Pu Yi
was particularly useful to the Japanese because, as far as most people
were concerned, if they thought about it at all, they were still under
the Manchu emperor.  Dr.  Xia considered himself a loyal subject, and
my grandmother took the same view.  Traditionally, an important way in
which a woman expressed her love for her man was by agreeing with him
in everything, and this came naturally to my grandmother.  She was so
contented with Dr.  Xia that she did not want to turn her mind even
slightly in the direction of disagreement.

At school my mother was taught that her country was Manchukuo, and that
among its neighboring countries there were two republics of China one
hostile, led by Chiang Kai-shek; the other friendly, headed by
WangJingwei (Japan's puplSet ruler of part of China).  She was taught
no concept of a "China' of which Manchuria was part.

The pupils were educated to be obedient subjects of Manchukuo.  One of
the first songs my mother learned was'

Red boys and green gifts walk on the streets, They all say what a happy
place Manchukuo is.

LiE under the Japanese You are happy and I am happy, Everyone lives
peacefully and works joyfully free of any worries.

The teachers said that Manchukuo was a paradise on earth.

But even at her age my mother could see that if the place could be
called a paradise it was only for the Japanese.

Japanese children attended separate schools, which were well equipped
and well heated, with shining floors and clean windows.  The schools
for the local children were in dilapidated temples and crumbling houses
donated by private patrons.  There was no heating.  In winter the whole
class often had to run around the block in the middle of a lesson or
engage in collective foot stamping to ward off the cold.

Not only were the teachers mainly Japanese, they also used Japanese
methods, hitting the children as a matter of course.  The slightest
mistake or failure to observe the prescribed rules and etiquette, such
as a girl having her hair half an inch below her earlobes, was punished
with blows.  Both gifts and boys were slapped on the face, hard, and
boys were frequently struck on the head with a wooden club.  Another
punishment was to be made to kneel for hours in the snow.

When local children passed a Japanese in the street, they had to bow
and make way, even if the Japanese was younger than themselves.
Japanese children would often stop local children and slap them for no
reason at all.  The pupils had to bow elaborately to their teachers
every time they met them.  My mother joked to her friends that a
Japanese teacher passing by was like a whirlwind sweeping through a
field of grass you just saw the grass bending as the wind blew by.

Many adults bowed to the Japanese, too, for fear of offending them, but
the Japanese presence did not impinge greatly on the Xias at first.
Middle- and lower-echelon positions were held by locals, both Manchus
and Han

Chinese, like my great-grandfather, who kept his job as deputy police
chief of Yixian.  By 1940, there were about 15,000 Japanese in Jinzhou.
The people living in the next house to the Xias were Japanese, and my
grandmother was friendly with them.  The husband was a government
official.  Every morning his wife would stand outside the gate with
their three children and bow deeply to him as he got into a rickshaw to
go to work.  After that she would start her own work, kneading coal
dust into balls for fuel.

For reasons my grandmother and my mother never understood, she always
wore white gloves, which became filthy in no time.

The Japanese woman often visited my grandmother.  She was lonely, with
her husband hardly ever at home.  She would bring a little sake, and my
grandmother would prepare some snacks, like soy-pickled vegetables.  My
grandmother spoke a little Japanese and the Japanese woman a little
Chinese.  They hummed songs to each other and shed tears together when
they became emotional.  They often helped in each other's gardens, too.
The Japanese neighbor had very smart gardening tools, which my
grandmother admired greatly, and my mother was often invited over to
play in her garden.

But the Xias could not avoid hearing what the Japanese were doing.  In
the vast expanses of northern Manchuria villages were being burned and
the surviving population herded into 'strategic hamlets."  Over five
million people, about a sixth of the population, lost their homes, and
tens of thousands died.  Laborers were worked to death in mines under
Japanese guards to produce exports to Japan for Manchuria was
particularly rich in natural resources.  Many were deprived of salt and
did not have the energy to run away.

Dr.  Xia had argued for a long time that the emperor did not know about
the evil things being done because he was a virtual prisoner of the
Japanese.  But when Pu Yi changed the way he referred to Japan from
'our friendly neighbor

Life under the Japanese ~7 country' to 'the elder brother country' and
finally to 'parent country," Dr.  Xia banged his fist on the table and
called him 'that famous coward."  Even then, he said he ~sas not sure
how much responsibility the emperor should bear for the atrocities,
until two traumatic events changed the Xias' world.

One day in late 194x Dr.  Xia was in his surgery when a man he had
never seen came into the room.  He was dressed in rags, and his
emaciated body was bent almost double.  The man explained that he was a
railway coolie, and that he had been having agonizing stomach pains.
His work involved carrying heavy loads from dawn to dusk, 365 days a
year.  He did not know how he could go on, but if he lost his job he
would not be able to support his wife and newborn baby.

Dr.  Xia told him his stomach could not digest the coarse food he had
to eat.  On 1 June 1939, the government had announced that henceforth
rice was reserved for the Japanese and a small number of collaborators.
Most of the local population had to subsist on a diet of acorn meal and
sorghum, which were difficult to digest.  Dr.  Xia gave the man some
medicine free of charge, and asked my grandmother to give him a small
bag of rice which she had bought illegally on the black market.

Not long afterward, Dr.  Xia heard that the man had died in a forced
labor camp.  After leaving the surgery he had eaten the rice, gone back
to work, and then vomited at the railway yard.  A Japanese guard had
spotted rice in his vomit and he had been arrested as an 'economic
criminal' and hauled off to a camp.  In his weakened state, he survived
only a few days.  When his wife heard what had happened to him, she
drowned herself with their baby.

The incident plunged Dr.  Xia and my grandmother into deep grief.  They
felt responsible for the man's death.  Many times Dr.  Xia would say:
"Rice can murder as well as save!

A small bagful, three lives!"  He started to call Pu Yi 'that
tyrant."

Shortly after this, tragedy struck closer to home.  Dr.  Xia's youngest
son was working as a schoolteacher in Yixian.  As in every school in
Manchukuo, there was a big portrait of Pu Yi in the office of the
Japanese headmaster, which everyone had to salute when they entered the
room.

One day Dr.  Xia's son forgot to bow to Pu Yi.  The headmaster shouted
at him to bow at once and slapped him so hard across the face he
knocked him off balance.  Dr.  Xia's son was enraged: "Do I have to
bend double every day?

Can I not stand up straight even for a momenff I have just done my
obeisance in morning assembly .... The headmaster slapped him again and
barked: "This is your emperor!  You Manchurians need to be taught
elementary propriety!"  Dr.  Xia's son shouted back: "Big deal!  It's
only a piece of paper?  At that moment two other teachers, both locals,
came by and managed to stop him from saying anything more
incriminating.  He recovered his self-control and eventually forced
himself to perform a bow of sorts to the portrait.

That evening a friend came to his house and told him that word was out
that he had been branded a 'thought criminal' an offense which was
punishable by imprisonment, and possibly death.  He ran away, and his
family never heard of him again.  Probably he was caught and died in
prison, or else in a labor camp.  Dr.  Xia never recovered from the
blow, which turned him into a determined foe of Manchukuo and of Pu
Yi.

This was not the end of the story.  Because of his brother's 'crime,"
local thugs began to harass De-gui, Dr.  Xia's only surviving son,
demanding protection money and claiming he had failed in his duty as
the elder brother.  He paid up, but the gangsters only demanded more.
In the end, he had to sell the medicine shop and leave Yixian for
Mukden, where he opened a new shop.

By now, Dr.  Xia was becoming more and more successful.

He treated Japanese as well as locals.  Sometimes after

Life under the Japanese So treating a senior Japanese officer or a
collaborator he would say, "I wish he were dead," but his personal
views never affected his professional attitude.

"A patient is a human being," he used to say.

"That is all a doctor should think about.  He should not mind what kind
of a human being he is."

My grandmother had meanwhile brought her mother to Jinzhou.  When she
left home to marry Dr.  Xia, her mother had been left alone in the
house with her husband, who despised her, and the two Mongolian
concubines, who hated her.  She began to suspect that the concubines
wanted to poison her and her small son, Yu-lin.  She always used silver
chopsticks, as the Chinese believe that silver will turn black if it
comes into contact with poison, and she never touched her food or let
Yu-lin touch it until she had tested it out on her dog.  One day, a few
months after my grandmother had left the house, the dog dropped dead.

For the first time in her life, she had a big row with her husband; and
with the support of her mother-in-law, old Mrs.  Yang, she moved out
with Yu-lin into rented accommodation.  Old Mrs.  Yang was so disgusted
with her son that she left home with them, and never saw her son again
except at her deathbed.

In the first three years, Mr.  Yang reluctantly sent them a monthly
allowance, but at the beginning of 1939 this stopped, and Dr.  Xia and
my grandmother had to support the three of them.  In those days there
was no maintenance law, as there was no proper legal system, so a wife
was entirely at the mercy of her husband.  When old Mrs.  Yang died in
1942 my great-grandmother and Yu-lin moved to Jinzhou, and went to live
in Dr.  Xia's house.  She considered herself and her son to be
second-class citizens, living on charity.  She spent her time washing
the family's clothes and cleaning up obsessively, nervously obsequious
toward her daughter and Dr.  Xia.  She was a pious Buddhist and every
day in her prayers asked Buddha not to reincarnate her as a woman.

"Let me become a cat or a dog, but

9o "They All Say What a Happy Place Manchukuo Is' not a woman," was her
constant murmur as she shuffled around the house, oozing apology with
every step.

My grandmother had also brought her sister, Lan, whom she loved dearly,
to Jinzhou.  Lan had married a man in Yixian who turned out to be a
homosexual.  He had offered her to a rich uncle, for whom he worked and
who owned a vegetable-oil factory.  The uncle had raped several female
members of the household, including his young granddaughter.  Because
he was the head of the family, wielding immense power over all its
members, Lan did not dare resist him.  But when her husband offered her
to his uncle's business parmer she refused.  My grandmother had to pay
the husband to disown her (x/u), as a woman could not ask for a
divorce.  My grandmother brought her to Jinzhou, where she was
remarried, to a man called Pei-o.

Pei-o was a warder in the prison, and the couple often visited my
grandmother.  Pei-o's stories made my mother's hair stand on end.  The
prison was crammed with political prisoners.  Pei-o often said how
brave they were, and how they would curse the Japanese even as they
were being tortured.  Torture was standard practice, and the prisoners
received no medical treaunent.  Their wounds were just left to rot.

Dr.  Xia offered to go and treat the prisoners.  On one of his first
visits he was introduced by Pei-o to a friend of his called Dong, an
executioner, who operated the garrote.

The prisoner was tied to a chair with a rope around his neck.  The rope
was then slowly tightened.  Death was excruciatingly slow.

Dr.  Xia knew from his brother-in-law that Dong's conscience was
troubled, and that whenever he was due to garrote someone, he had to
get himself drunk beforehand.

Dr.  Xia invited Dong to his house.  He offered him gifts and suggested
that perhaps he could avoid tightening the rope all the way.  Dong said
he would see what he could do.  There was usually a Japanese guard or a
trusted collaborator present, but sometimes, if the victim was not

Lip under the Japanese 9I important enough, the Japanese did not bother
to show up.

At other times, they left before the prisoner was actually dead.  On
such occasions, Dong hinted, he could stop the garrote before the
prisoner died.

After prisoners were garroted, their bodies were put into thin wooden
boxes and taken on a cart to a stretch of barren land on the outskirts
of town called South Hill, where they were tipped into a shallow pit.
The place was infested with wild dogs, who lived on the corpses.  Baby
gifts who had been killed by their families, which was common in those
days, were also often dumped in the pit.

Dr.  Xia struck up a relationship with the old cart driver, and gave
him money from time to time.  Occasionally the driver would come into
the surgery and start rambling on about life, in an apparently
incoherent way, but eventually he would begin talking about the
graveyard: "I told the dead souls it was not my fault they had ended up
there.  I told them that, for my part, I wished them well.

"Come back next year for your anniversary, dead souls.  But in the
meantime, if you wish to fly away to look for better bodies to be
reincarnated in, go in the direction your head is pointed.  That is a
good path for you."  Dong and the cart driver never spoke to each other
about what they were doing, and Dr.  Xia never knew how many people
they had saved.  After the war the rescued 'corpses' chipped in and
raised money for Dong to buy a house and some land.  The cart driver
had died.

One man whose life they helped save was a distant cousin of my
grandmother's called Han-chen, who had been an important figure in the
resistance movement.

Because Jinzhou was the main raiiway junction north of the Great Wall,
it became the assembly point for the Japanese in their assault on China
proper, which started in July 1937.  Security was extremely tight, and
Han-chen's organization was infiltrated by a spy, and the entire group
was arrested.  They were all tortured.  First water with hot chiles was
forced down their noses; then their faces were slapped
with a shoe which had
sharp nails sticking out of the sole.

Then most of them were executed.  For a long time the Xias thought
Han-chen was dead, until one day Uncle Pei-o told them that he was
still alive but about to be executed.  Dr.  Xia immediately contacted
Dong.

On the night of the execution Dr.  Xia and my grandmother went to South
Hill with a carriage.  They parked behind a clump of trees and waited.
They could hear the wild dogs rummaging around by the pit, from which
rose the sickly stench of decomposing flesh.  At last a cart appeared.
Through the darkness they could dimly see the old driver climbing down
and tipping some bodies out of wooden boxes.  They waited for him to
drive off and then went over to the pit.  After groping among the
corpses they found Han-chen, but could not tell if he was dead or
alive.

Eventually they realized he was still breathing.  He had been so badly
tortured he could not walk, so with great effort they lifted him into
the carriage and drove him back to their house.

They hid him in a tiny room in the innermost corner of the house.  Its
one door led into my mother's room, to which the only other access was
from her parents' bedroom.  No one would ever go into the room by
chance.  As the house was the only one which had direct access to the
courtyard, Han-chen could exercise there in safety, as long as someone
kept watch.

There was the danger of a raid by the police or the local neighborhood
committees.  Early on in the occupation the Japanese had set up a
widespread system of neighbor hood control.  They made the local big
shots the heads of these units, and these neighborhood bosses helped
collect taxes and kept a round-the-clock watch for 'lawless elements."
It was a form of institutionalized gangsterism, in which 'protection'
and informing were the keys to power.

The Japanese also offered large rewards for turning people in.  The
Manchukuo police were less of a threat than ordinary civilians.  In
fact, many of the police were quite anti

Lip under the Japanese 93 Japanese.  One of their main jobs was to
check people's registration, and they used to carry out frequent
house-to house searches.  But they would announce their arrival by
shouting out "Checking registrations!  Checking registrations!"  so
that anyone who wanted to hide had plenty of time.  Whenever Han-chen
or my grandmother heard this shout she would hide him in a pile of
dried sorghum stacked in the end room for fuel.  The police would
saunter into the house and sit down and have a cup of tea, telling my
grandmother rather apologetically, "All this is just a formality, you
know .... '

At the time my mother was eleven.  Even though her parents did not tell
her what was going on, she knew she must not talk about Han-chen being
in the house.  She learned discretion from childhood.

Slowly, my grandmother nursed Han-chen back to health, and after three
months he was well enough to move on.  It was an emotional farewell.

"Elder sister and elder brother-in-law," he said, "I will never forget
that I owe my life to you.  As soon as I have the chance, I will repay
my great debt to you both."  Three years later he came back and was as
good as his word.

As part of their education, my mother and her classmates had to watch
newsreels of Japan's progress in the war.  Far from being ashamed of
their brutality, the Japanese vaunted it as a way to inculcate fear.
The films showed Japanese soldiers cutting people in half and prisoners
tied to stakes being torn to pieces by dogs.  There were lingering
close-ups of the victims' terror-stricken eyes as their attackers came
at them.  The Japanese watched the eleven and twelve-year-old
schoolgirls to make sure they did not shut their eyes or try to stick a
handkerchief in their mouths to stifle their screams.  My mother had
nightmares for years to come.

During 1942, with their army stretched out across China, Southeast
Asia, and the Pacific Ocean, the Japanese found themselves running
short of labor.  My mother's whole class was conscripted to work in a
textile factory, as were the Japanese children.  The local girls had to
walk about four miles each way; the Japanese children went by truck.
The local girls got a thin gruel made from moldy maize with dead worms
floating in it; the Japanese girls had packed lunches with meat,
vegetables, and fruit.

The Japanese girls had easy jobs, like cleaning windows.

But the local girls had to operate complex spinning machines, which
were highly demanding and dangerous even for adults.  Their main job
was to reconnect broken threads while the machines were running at
speed.  If they did not spot the broken thread, or reconnect it fast
enough, they would be savagely beaten by the Japanese supervisor.

The girls were terrified.  The combination of nervousness, cold,
hunger, and fatigue led to many accidents.  Over half of my mother's
fellow pupils suffered injuries.  One day my mother saw a shuttle spin
out of a machine and knock out the eye of the girl next to her.  All
the way to the hospital the Japanese supervisor scolded the girl for
not being careful enough.

After the stint in the factory, my mother moved up into junior high
school.  Times had changed since my grandmother's youth, and young
women were no longer confined to the four walls of their home.  It was
socially acceptable for women to get a high school education.  However,
boys and girls received different educations.  For girls the aim was to
turn them into 'gracious wives and good mothers," as the school motto
put it.  They learned what the Japanese called 'the way of a woman'
looking after a household, cooking and sewing, the tea ceremony, flower
arrangement, embroidery, drawing, and the appreciation of art.  The
single most important thing imparted was how to please one's husband.
This included how to dress, how to do one's hair, how to bow, and,
above all, how to obey, without question.  As my grandmother put it, my
mother seemed to have 'rebellious bones," and learned almost none of
these skills, even cooking.

Some exams took the form of practical assignments.

such as preparing a particular dish or arranging flowers.

The examination board was made up of local officials, both Japanese and
Chinese, and as well as assessing the exams, they also sized up the
girls.  Photos of them wearing prett3' aprons they had designed
themselves were put up on the notice board with their assignments.
Japanese officials often picked fiances from among the girls, as
intermarriage between Japanese men and local women was encouraged. Some
girls were also selected to go to Japan to be married to men they had
not met.  Quite often the girls or rather their families were willing. 
Toward the end of the occupation one of my mother's friends was chosen
to go to Japan, but she missed the ship and was still in JMzhou when
the Japanese surrendered.  My mother looked askance at her.

In contrast with their Chinese Mandarin predecessors, who shunned
physical activity, the Japanese were keen on sports, which my mother
loved.  She had recovered from her hip injury, and was a good runner.
Once she was selected to run in an important race.  She trained for
weeks, and was all keyed up for the big day, but a few days before the
race the coach, who was Chinese, took her aside and asked her not to
try to win.  He said he could not explain why.  My mother understood.
She knew the Japanese did not like to be beaten by the Chinese at
anything.  There was one other local girl in the race, and the coach
asked my mother to pass on the same advice to her, but not to tell her
that it came from him.  On the day of the race my mother did not even
finish in the first six.  Her friends could tell she was not trying.
But the other local girl could not bear to hold back, and came in
first.

The Japanese soon took their revenge.  Every morning there was an
assembly, presided over by the headmaster, who was nicknamed "Donkey'
because his name when read in the Chinese way (Mao-h) sounded like the
word for donkey (mao-h).  He would bark out orders in harsh,

guttural tones for the four low bows toward the four designated points.
First, "Distant worship of the imperial capital!"  in the direction of
Tokyo.  Then, "Distant worship of the national capital!"  toward
Hsinking, the capital of Manchukuo.  Next, "Devoted worship of the
Celestial Emperor!"  meaning the emperor of Japan.  Finally, "Devoted
worship of the imperial portrait!"  this time to the portrait of Pu Yi.
After this came a shallower bow to the teachers.

On this particular morning, after the bowing was completed, the girl
who had won the race the day before was suddenly dragged out of her row
by "Donkey," who claimed that her bow to Pu Yi had been less than
ninety degrees.  He slapped and kicked her and announced that she was
being expelled.  This was a catastrophe for her and her family.

Her parents hurriedly married her off to a petty government official.
After Japan's defeat her husband was branded as a collaborator, and as
a result the only job his wife could get was in a chemical plant. There
were no pollution controls, and when my mother went back to Jinzhou in
1984 and tracked her down she had gone almost blind from the chemicals.
She was wry about the ironies of her life: having beaten the Japanese
in a race, she had ended up being treated as a kind of collaborator. 
Even so, she said she had no regrets about winning the race.

It was difficult for people in Manchukuo to get much idea of what was
happening in the rest of the world, or of how Japan was faring in the
war.  The fighting was a long way away, news was strictly censored, and
the radio churned out nothing but propaganda.  But they got a sense
that Japan was in trouble from a number of signs, especially the
worsening food situation.

The first real news came in summer 1943, when the newspapers reported
that one of Japan's allies, Italy, had surrendered.  By the middle of
1944 some Japanese civilians staffing government offices in Manchukuo
were being conscripted.  Then, on 19July 1944, American B-29s appeared
in the sky over Jinzhou for the first time, though they did not bomb
the city.  The Japanese ordered even household to dig air-raid
shelters, and there was a compulsory air-raid drill every day at
school.  One day a girl in my mother's class picked up a fire
extinguisher and squirted it at a Japanese teacher whom she
particularly loathed.

Previously, this would have brought dire retribution,-but now she was
allowed to get away with it.  The fide was turning.

There had been a long-standing campaign to catch flies and rats.  The
pupils had to chop off the rats' tails, put them in envelopes, and hand
them in to the police.  The flies had to be put in glass bottles.  The
police counted every rat tail and every dead fly.  One day in 1944 when
my mother handed in a glass bottle full to the brim with flies, the
Manchukuo policeman said to her: "Not enough for a meal."  When he saw
the surprised look on her face, he said: "Don't you know?  The Nips
like dead flies.  They fry them and eat them!"  My mother could see
from the cynical gleam in his eye that he no longer regarded the
Japanese as awesome.

My mother was excited and full of anticipation, but during the autumn
of 1944 a dark cloud had appeared: her home did not seem to be as happy
as before.  She sensed there was discord between her parents.

The fifteenth night of the eighth moon of the Chinese year was the
Mid-Autumn Festival, the festival of family union.  On that night my
grandmother would place a table with melons, round cakes, and buns
outside in the moonlight, in accordance with the custom.  The reason
this date was the festival of family union is that the Chinese word for
'union' (yuan) is the same as that for 'round' or 'unbroken'; the full
autumn moon was supposed to look especially, splendidly, round at this
time.  All the items of food eaten on that day had to be round too.

In the silky moonlight, my grandmother would tell my mother stories
about the moon: the largest shadow in it was a giant cassia tree which
a certain lord, Wu Gang, was spending his entire life trying to cut
down.  But the tree was enchanted and he was doomed to repeated
failu/e.  My mother would stare up into the sky and listen,
fascinated.

The full moon was mesmerizingly beautiful to her, but on that night she
was not allowed to describe it, because she was forbidden by her mother
to utter the word 'round," as Dr.  Xia's family had been broken up. Dr.
Xia would be downcast for the whole day, and for several days before
and after the festival.  My grandmother would even lose her usual flair
for storytelling.

On the night of the festival in 1944, my mother and my grandmother were
sitting under a trellis covered with winter melons and beans, gazing
through the gaps in the shadowy leaves into the vast, cloudless sky. My
mother started to say, "The moon is particularly round tonight," but my
grandmother interrupted her sharply, then suddenly burst into tears.
She rushed into the house, and my mother heard her sobbing and
shrieking: "Go back to your son and grandsons!  Leave me and my
daughter and go your own way!"  Then, in gasps between sobs, she
said:

"Was it my fault or yours that your son killed himself?

Why should we have to bear the burden year after year?  It isn't me who
is stopping you seeing your children.  It is they who have refused to
come and see you .... Since they had left Yixian, only De-gui, Dr.
Xia's second son, had visited them.  My mother did not hear a sound
from

Dr.  Xia.

From then on my mother felt there was something wrong.  Dr.  Xia became
increasingly taciturn, and she instinctively avoided him.  Every now
and then my grandmother would become tearful, and murmur to herself
that she and Dr.  Xia could never be completely happy with the heavy
price they had paid for their love.  She would hug my mother close and
tell her that she was the only thing she had in her life.

Li.~ under the Japanese 99

My mother was in an uncharacterisfically melancholy mood as winter
descended on Jinzhou.  Even the appearance of a second flight of
American B-29s in the clear, cold December sky failed to lift her
spirits.

The Japanese were becoming more and more edgy.  One day one of my
mother's school friends got hold of a book by a banned Chinese writer.
Looking for somewhere quiet to read, she went off into the countryside,
where she found a cavern which she thought was an empty air-raid
shelter.

Groping around in the dark, her hand touched what felt like a light
switch.  A piercing noise erupted.  What she had touched was an alarm.
She had stumbled into an arms depot.  Her legs turned to jelly.  She
tried to run, but got only a couple of hundred yards before some
Japanese soldiers caught her and dragged her away.

Two days later the whole school was marched to a barren, snow-covered
stretch of ground outside the west gate, in a bend of the Xiaoling
River.  Local residents had also been summoned there by the
neighborhood chiefs.

The children were told they were to witness 'the punishment of an evil
person who disobeys Great Japan."  Suddenly my mother saw her friend
being hauled by Japanese guards to a spot right in front of her.  The
girl was in chains and could hardly walk.  She had been tortured, and
her face was so swollen that my mother could barely recognize her. Then
the Japanese soldiers lifted their rifles and pointed them at the girl,
who seemed to be trying to say something, but no sound came out. There
was a crack of bullets, and the girl's body slumped as her blood began
to drip onto the snow.

"Donkey," the Japanese headmaster, was scanning the rows of his pupils.
With a tremendous effort, my mother tried to hide her emotions.  She
forced herself to look at the body of her friend, which by now was
lying in a glistening red patch in the white snow.

She heard someone trying to suppress sobs.  It was Mi~s Tanaka, a young
Japanese woman teacher whom she liked.

In an instant "Donkey' was on Miss Tanaka, slapping and

kicking her.  She fell to the ground, and tried to roll out of the way
of his boots, but he went on kicking her ferociously.

She had betrayed the Japanese race, he bawled.  Eventually "Donkey'
stopped, looked up at the pupils, and barked the order to march off.

My mother took one last look at the crooked body of her teacher and the
corpse of her friend and forced down her hate.

4. "Slaves Who Have No Country of Your Own' Ruled by Different
Masters

(1945-1947)

In May 1945 the news spread around Jinzhou that Germany had surrendered
and that the war in Europe was over.  US planes were flying over the
area much more often:

B-19s were bombing other cities in Manchuria, though Jinzhou was not
attacked.  The feeling that Japan would soon be defeated swept through
the city.

On 8 August my mother's school was ordered to go to a shrine to pray
for the victory of Japan.  The next day, Soviet and Mongolian troops
entered Manchukuo.  News came through that the Americans had dropped
two atom bombs on Japan: the locals cheered the news.  The following
days were punctuated by air-raid scares, and school stopped.  My mother
stayed at home helping to dig an air-raid shelter.

On 13 August the Xias heard that Japan was suing for peace.  Two days
later a Chinese neighbor who worked in the government rushed into their
house to tell them' there was going to be an important announcement on
the radio.  Dr.  Xia stopped work and came and sat with my grandmother
in the
courtyard.  The announcer said that the Japanese emperor had
surrendered.  Immediately afterward came the news that Pu Yi had
abdicated as emperor of Manchukuo.  People crowded into the streets in
a state of high excitement.  My mother went to her school to see what
was happening there.  The place seemed dead, except for a faint noise
coming from one of the offices.  She crept up to have a look: through
the window she could see the Japanese teachers huddled together
weeping.

She hardly slept a wink that night and was up at the crack of dawn.
When she opened the front door in the morning she saw a small crowd in
the street.  The bodies of a Japanese woman and two children were lying
in the road.  A Japanese officer had committed hara-kiri; his family
had been lynched.

One morning a few days after the surrender, the Xias' Japanese
neighbors were found dead.  Some said they had poisoned themselves. All
overJinzhou Japanese were committing suicide or being lynched. Japanese
houses were looted and my mother noticed that one of her poor neighbors
suddenly had quite a lot of valuable items for sale.

Schoolchildren revenged themselves on their Japanese teachers and beat
them up ferociously.  Some Japanese left their babies on the doorsteps
of local families in the hope that they would be saved.  A number of
Japanese women were raped; many shaved their heads to try to pass as
men.

My mother was worried about Miss Tanaka, who was the only teacher at
her school who never slapped the pupils and the only Japanese who had
shown distress when my mother's schoolfriend had been executed.  She
asked her parents if she could hide her in their house.  My grandmother
looked anxious, but said nothing.  Dr.  Xia just nodded.

My mother borrowed a set of clothes from her aunt Lan, who was about
the teacher's size, then went and found Miss Tanaka, who was barricaded
in her aparunent.  The

Ruled by Different Masters I o3 clothes fit her well.  She was taller
than the average Japanese woman, and could easily pass for a Chinese.
In case anybody asked, they would say she was my mother's cousin.

The Chinese have so many cousins no one can keep track of them.  She
moved into the end room, which had once been Han-chen's refuge.

In the vacuum left by the Japanese surrender and the collapse of the
Manchukuo regime the victims were not just Japanese.  The city was in
chaos.  At night there were gunshots and frequent screams for help. The
male members of the household, including my grandmother's
fifteen-year-old brother Yu-lin and Dr.  Xia's apprentices, took turns
keeping guard on the roof every night, armed with stones, axes, and
cleavers.  Unlike my grandmother, my mother was not scared at all.  My
grandmother was amazed: "You have your father's blood in your veins,"
she used to say to her.

The looting, raping, and killing continued until eight days after the
Japanese surrender, when the population was informed that a new army
would be arriving the Soviet Red Army.  On 23 August the neighborhood
chiefs told residents to go to the railway station the next day to
welcome the Russians.  Dr.  Xia and my grandmother stayed at home, but
my mother joined the large, high-spirited crowd of young people holding
colorful triangle-shaped paper flags.  As the train pulled in, the
crowd started waving their flags and shouting' Wula' (the Chinese
approximation of Ura, the Russian word for "Hurrah').  My mother had
imagined the Soviet soldiers as victorious heroes with impressive
beards, riding on large horses.  What she saw was a group of shabbily
dressed" pale-skinned youths.

Apart from the occasional fleeting glimpse of some mysterious figure in
a passing car, these were the first white people my mother had ever
seen.

About a thousand Soviet troops were stationed in Jinzhou, and when they
first arrived people felt grateful to them for helping to get rid of
the Japanese.  But the

104 "Slaves Who Have No Country of Your Own' Russians brought new
problems.  Schools had closed down when the Japanese surrendered, and
my mother was getting private lessons.  One day on her way home from
the tutor's, she saw a truck parked by the side of the road:

some Russian soldiers were standing beside it handing out bolts of
textiles.  Under the Japanese, cloth had been strictly rationed.  She
went over to have a look; it turned out the cloth was from the factory
where she had worked when she was in primary school.  The Russians were
swapping it for watches, clocks, and knickknacks.  My mother remembered
that there was an old clock buried somewhere at the bottom of a chest
at home.  She rushed back and dug it out.  She was a bit disappointed
to find it was broken, but the Russian soldiers were overjoyed and gave
her a bolt of beautiful white cloth with a delicate pink flower pattern
on it.  Over supper, the family sat shaking their heads in disbelief at
these strange foreigners who were so keen on useless old broken clocks
and baubles.

Not only were the Russians distributing goods from the factories, they
were also dismantling entire factories, including Jinzhou's two oil
refineries, and shipping the equipment back to the Soviet Union.  They
said these were 'reparations," but for the locals what this meant was
that industry was crippled.

Russian soldiers would walk into people's homes and simply take
anything they fancied watches and clothes in particular.  Stories about
Russians raping local women swept Jinzhou like wildfire.  Many women
went into hiding for fear of their 'liberators."  Very soon the city
was seething with anger and anxiety.

The Xias' house was outside the city walls, and was very poorly
protected.  A friend of my mother's offered to lend them a house inside
the city gates, surrounded by high stone walls.  The family decamped
immediately, taking my mother's Japanese teacher with them.  The move
meant that my mother had to walk much farther about thirty minutes each
way- to her tutor's.  Dr.  Xia insisted on taking her there and
collecting her in the afternoon.  My mother did not want him to walk so
far, so she would walk part of the way back on her own and he would
meet her.  One day a jeep-load of laughing Russian soldiers skidded to
a halt near her and the Russians jumped out and started running in her
direction.  She ran as fast as she could, with the Russians pounding
after her.  After a few hundred yards she caught sight of her
stepfather in the distance, brandishing his walking stick.  The
Russians were close behind, and my mother turned into a deserted
kindergarten she knew well, which was like a labyrinth.  She hid there
for over an hour and then sneaked out the back door and got home
safely.  Dr.  Xia had seen the Russians chasing my mother into the
building; to his immense relief they soon came out again, obviously
baffled by the layout.

just over a week after the Russians arrived, my mother was told by the
chief of her neighborhood committee to attend a meeting the following
evening.  When she got there she saw a number of shabby Chinese men and
a few women making speeches about how they had fought eight years to
defeat the Japanese so that ordinary people could be the masters of a
new China.  These were Communists Chinese Communists.  They had entered
the city the previous day, without fanfare or warning.  The women
Communists at the meeting wore shapeless clothes exactly like the men.
My mother thought to herself: How could you claim to have defeated the
Japanese?  You haven't even got decent guns or clothes.  To her, the
Communists looked poorer and scruffier than beggars.

She was disappointed because she had imagined them as big and handsome,
and superhuman.  Her uncle Pei-o, the prison warder, and Dong, the
executioner, had told her that the Communists were the bravest
prisoners: "They have the strongest bones," her uncle often said.

"They sang and shouted slogans and cursed the Japanese until the very
last minute before they were strangled," said Dong.

The Communists put up notices calling on the population to keep order,
and started arresting collaborators and people who had worked for the
Japanese security forces.

Among those arrested was Yang, my grandmother's father, still deputy
police chief of Yixian.  He was imprisoned in his own jail and his
boss, the police chief, was executed.

The Communists soon restored order and got the economy going again. The
food situation, which had been desperate, improved markedly.  Dr. Xia
was able to start seeing patients again, and my mother's school
reopened.

The Communists were billeted in the houses of local people.  They
seemed honest and unpretentious, and would chat with the families: "We
don't have enough educated people," they used to say to one friend of
my mother's.

"Come and join us and you can become a county chief."

They needed recruits.  At the time of the Japanese surrender, both
Communists and Kuomintang had tried to occupy as much territory as they
could, but the Kuomintang had a much larger and better-equipped army.
Both were maneuvering for position in preparation for renewing the
civil war which had been partly suspended for the previous eight years
in order to fight the Japanese.  In fact, fighting between Communists
and Kuomintang had already broken out.  Manchuria was the crucial
battleground because of its economic assets.  Because they were nearby,
the Communists had got their forces into Manchuria first, with
virtually no assistance from the Russians.

But the Americans were helping Chiang Kai-shek establish himself in the
area by ferrying tens of thousands of Kuomintang troops to North China.
At one point the Americans tried to land some of them at Huludao, the
port about thirty miles from Jinzhou, but had to withdraw under fire
from Chinese Communists.  The Kuomintang troops were forced to land
south of the Great Wall and make their way north by train.  The United
States gave them air cover.

Altogether, over 50,000 US Marines landed in North China, occupying
Peking and Tianjin.

The Russians formally recognized Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang as the
government of China.  By 11 November, the Soviet Red Army had left the
Jinzhou area and pulled back to northern Manchuria, as part of a
commitment by Stalin to withdraw from the area within three months of
victory.  This left the Chinese Communists alone in control of the
city.  One evening in late November my mother was walking home from
school when she saw large numbers of soldiers hurriedly gathering their
weapons and equipment and moving in the direction of the south gate.

She knew there had been heavy fighting in the surrounding countryside
and guessed the Communists must be leaving.

This withdrawal was in line with the strategy of the Communist leader
Mao Zedong not to try to hold cities, where the Kuomintang would have
the military advantage, but to retreat to the rural areas.

"To surround the cities with our countryside and eventually take the
cities' was Mao's guideline for the new phase.

On the day after the Chinese Communists withdrew from Jinzhou, a new
army entered the city the fourth in as many months.  This army had
clean uniforms and gleaming new American weapons.  It was the
Kuomintang.

People ran out of their houses and gathered in the narrow mud streets,
clapping and cheering.  My mother squeezed her way to the front of the
excited crowd.  Suddenly she found she was waving her arms and cheering
loudly.  These soldiers really look like the army which beat the
Japanese, she thought to herself.  She ran home in a state of high
excitement to tell her parents about the smart new soldiers.

There was a festival atmosphere inJinzhou.  People competed to invite
troops to stay in their homes.  One officer came to live with the Xias.
He behaved extremely respectfully, and the family all liked him.  My
grandmother and Dr.  Xia felt that the Kuomintang would maintain law
and order and ensure peace at last.

But the goodwill people had felt toward the Kuomintang soon turned to
bitter disappointment.  Most of the officials

came from other parts of China, and talked down to the local people,
addressing them as Wang-guo-nu ("Slaves who have no country of your
own') and lecturing them about how they ought to be grateful to the
Kuomintang for liberating them from the Japanese.  One evening there
was a party at my mother's school for the students and Kuomintang
officers.  The three-year-old daughter of one official recited a speech
which began: "We, the Kuomintang, have been fighting the Japanese for
eight years and have now saved you, who were the slaves of Japan ....
My mother and her friends walked out.

My mother was also disgusted by the way the Kuomintang rushed to grab
concubines.  By early 1946 Jinzhou was filling up with troops.  My
mother's school was the only girls' school in town, and officers and
officials descended on it in droves in search of concubines or,
occasionally, wives.  Some of the girls got married willingly, while
others were unable to say no to their families, who thought that
marrying an officer would give them a good start in life.

At fifteen, my mother was highly marriageable.  She had grown into a
very attractive and popular young woman, and she was the star pupil at
her school.  Several officers had already proposed, but she told her
parents she did not want any of them.  One, who was chief of staff of a
general, threatened to send a sedan chair to carry her off after his
gold bars had been refused.  My mother was eavesdropping outside the
door as he put this proposal to her parents.

She burst in and told him to his face that she would kill herself in
the sedan chair.  Fortunately, not long afterward his unit was ordered
out of the city.

My mother had made up her mind to choose her own husband.  She was
disenchanted with the treatment of women, and hated the whole system of
concubinage.  Her parents supported her, but they were harassed by
offers, and had to deploy intricate, nerve-racking diplomacy to find
ways of saying no without unleashing reprisals.

One of my mother's teachers was a young woman called

Miss Liu, who liked her very much.  In China, if people are fond of
you, they often try to make you an honor an member of their family.  At
this time, although they ~'ere not so segregated as in my grandmother's
days, there were not many opportunities for boys and girls to mix, so
being introduced to the brother or sister of a friend was a common way
for young people who did not like the idea of arranged marriages to get
to know each other. Miss Liu introduced my mother to her brother.  But
first Mr.  and Mrs. Liu had to approve the relationship.

Early in 1946, my mother was invited to spend the Chinese New Year at
the Lius' house, which was quite grand.  Mr.  Liu was one of the
biggest shop owners in Jinzhou.  The son, who was about nineteen,
seemed to be a man of the world; he was wearing a dark-green suit with
a handkerchief sticking out of his breast pocket, which was
tremendously sophisticated and dashing for a provincial town like
Jinzhou.  He was enrolled in a university in Peking, where he was
reading Russian language and literature.  My mother was very impressed
with him, and his family approved of her.  They soon sent a go-between
to Dr.  Xia to ask for her hand, without, of course, saying a word to
her.

Dr.  Xia was more liberal than most men of his time, and asked my
mother how she felt about the matter.  She agreed to be a 'friend' to
young Mr.  Liu.  At that time, if a boy and a girl were seen talking to
each other in public, they had to be engaged, at the minimum.  My
mother was longing to have some fun and freedom, and to be able to make
friends with men without committing herself to marriage.

Dr.  Xia and my grandmother, knowing my mother, were cautious with the
Lius, and declined all the customary presents.  In the Chinese
tradition, a woman's family often did not consent to a marriage
proposal immediately,-as they should not appear too keen.  If they
accepted presents, this implicitly indicated consent.  Dr.  Xia and my
grandmother were worried about a misunderstanding.

x xo "Slaves Who Have No Country of Your Own'

My mother went out with young Liu for a while.  She was rather taken
with his urbanity, and all her relatives, friends, and neighbors said
she had made a good match.  Dr.  Xia and my grandmother thought they
were a handsome couple, and had privately settled on him as their
son-inlaw.  But my mother felt he was shallow.  She noticed that he
never went to Peking, but lounged around at home enjoying the life of a
dilettante.  One day she discovered he had not even read The Dream of
the Red Chamber, the famous eighteenth-century Chinese classic, with
which every literate Chinese was familiar.  When she showed how
disappointed she felt, young Liu said airily that the Chinese classics
were not his forte, and that what he actually liked most was foreign
literature.  To try to reassert his superiority, he added: "Now, have
you read Madame Bovary?  That's my all-time favorite.  I consider it
the greatest of Maupassant's works."

My mother had read Madame Bovary and she knew it was by Flaubert, not
Maupassant.  This vain sally put her off Liu in a big way, but she
refrained from confronting him there and then to do so would have been
considered 'shrewish."

Liu loved gambling, particularly mahjongg, which bored my mother to
death.  One evening soon afterward, in the middle of a game, a female
servant came in and asked: "Which maid would Master Liu like to serve
him in bed?"  In a very casual way, Liu said "So-and-so."  My mother
was shaking with anger, but all Liu did was to raise his eyebrow as
though he was surprised at her reaction.

Then he said in a supercilious way: "This is a perfectly common custom
in Japan.  Everybody does it.  It's called si-qin ("bed with
service")."  He was trying to make my mother feel she was being
provincial and jealous, which was traditionally regarded in China as
one of the worst vices in a woman, and grounds for a husband to disown
his wife.  Once again my mother said nothing, even though she was
boiling with rage inside.

My mother decided she could not be
happy with a husband who regarded flirtations and extramarital sex as
essential aspects of 'being a man."  She wanted someone who loved her,
who would not want to hurt her by doing this sort of thing.  That
evening she made up her mind to end the relationship.

A few days later Mr.  Liu senior suddenly died.  In those days a
spectacular funeral was very important, particularly if the dead person
had been the head of the family.  A funeral which failed to meet the
expectations of the relatives and of society would bring disapproval on
the family.

The Lius wanted an elaborate ceremony, not simply a procession from the
house to the cemetery.  Monks were brought in to read the Buddhist
sutra of' putting the head down' in the presence of the whole family.
Immediately after this, the family members burst out crying.  From then
to the day of the burial, on the forty-ninth day after the death, the
sound of weeping and wailing was supposed to be heard nonstop from
early morning until midnight, accompanied by the constant burning of
artificial money for the deceased to use in the other world.  Many
families could not keep up this marathon, and hired professionals to do
the job for them.  The Lius were too filial to do this, and did all the
keening themselves, with the help of relatives, of whom there were
many.

On the forty-second day after his death, the corpse which had been put
in a beautifully carved sandalwood coffin was placed in a marquee in
the courtyard.  On each of the last seven nights before his interment
the dead man was supposed to ascend a high mountain in the other world
and look down on his whole family; he would only be happy if he saw
that every member of his family was present and taken care of.
Otherwise, it was believed, he would never find rest.  The family
wanted my mother to be there as the intended daughter-in-law.

She refused.  She felt sad for old Mr.  Liu, who had been kind to her,
but if she attended, she would never be able to get out of marrying his
son.  Relays of messengers from the Liu family came to the Xia house.

Dr.  Xia told my mother that breaking her relationship at this moment
was tantamount to letting Mr.  Liu senior down, and that this was
dishonorable.  Although he would not have objected to my mother
breaking up with young Mr.  Liu normally, he felt that under the
circumstances her wishes should be subordinated to a higher imperative.
My grandmother also thought she should go.  In addition she said, "Who
ever heard of a girl rejecting a man because he got the name of some
foreign writer wrong, or because he had affairs?  All rich young men
like to have fun and sow their wild oats.  Besides, you have no need to
worry about concubines and maids.  You're a strong character; you can
keep your husband under control."

This was not my mother's idea of the life she wanted, and she said so.
In her heart, my grandmother agreed.  But she was frightened about
keeping my mother at home because of the persistent proposals from
Kuomintang officers, "We can say no to one, but not to all of them,"
she told my mother.

"If you don't marry Zhang, you will have to accept Lee.

Think it over: isn't Liu much better than the others?  If you marry
him, no officer will be able to bother you anymore.  I worry day and
night about what may happen to you.  I won't be able to rest until you
leave the house."  But my mother said she would rather die than marry
someone who could not give her happiness and love.

The Lius were furious with my mother, and so were Dr.  Xia' and my
grandmother.  For days they argued, pleaded, cajoled, shouted, and
wept, to no avail.  Finally, for the first time since he had hit her as
a child for sitting in his seat on the kang, Dr.  Xia flew into a rage
with my mother.

"What you are doing is bringing shame on the name of Xia.  I don't want
a daughter like you!"  My mother stood up and flung back the words:
"All right, then, you won't have a daughter like me.  I'm leaving!" She
stormed out of the room, packed her things, and left the house.

Ruled by Different Masters I 13 In my grandmother's time, leaving home
like this would have been out of the question.  There were no jobs for
women, except as servants, and even they had to have references.  But
things had changed.  In 1946 women could live on their own and find
work, like teaching or medicine, although working was still regarded as
the last resort by most families.  In my mother's school was a teacher
training depariment which offered free board and tuition for girls who
had completed three years in the school.  Apart from an exam, the only
condition for entry was that the graduates had to become teachers. Most
pupils in the depa,uuent were either from poor families who could not
afford to pay for an education or people who did not think they had a
chance to get into a university, and therefore did not want to stay on
at the normal high school.  It was only since 1945 that women could
contemplate getting into a universiF; under the Japanese, they could
not go beyond high school, where they were mainly taught how to run a
family.

Up till now my mother had never considered going to this department,
which was generally looked down on as second best.  She had always
thought of herself as university material.  The depariment was a lit He
surprised when she applied, but she persuaded them of her fervent wish
to join the teaching profession.  She had not yet finished her
obligatory three years in the school, but she was known as a star
pupil.  The depa~uuent gladly took her after giving her an exam which
she passed with little difficulty.  She went to live in the school.  It
was not long before my grandmother rushed over to beg her to come home.
My mother was glad to have a reconciliation; she promised she would go
home and stay often.  But she insisted on keeping her bed on the
campus; she was determined not to be dependent on anyone, however much
they loved her.  For her, the deparunent was ideal.  It guaranteed her
a job after graduation, whereas university graduates often could not
find jobs.  Another advantage was that it was free and

Dr.  Xia was already beginning to suffer the effects of the
mismanagement of the economy.

The Kuomintang personnel put in charge of the factories those that had
not been dismantled by the Russians were conspicuously unsuccessful at
getting the economy moving again.  They got a few factories working at
well below full capacity, but pocketed most of the revenue
themselves.

Kuomintang carpetbaggers were moving into the smart houses which the
Japanese had vacated.  The house next door to the Xias' old house,
where the Japanese official had lived, was now occupied by an official
and one of his newly acquired concubines.  The mayor ofJinzhou, a Mr.
Han, was a local nobody.  Suddenly he was rich from the proceeds of
property confiscated from the Japanese and collaborators.  He acquired
several concubines, and the locals began to call the city government
'the Han household," as it was bulging with his relatives and
friends.

When the Kuomintang took Yixian they released my great-grandfather,
Yang, from prison or he bought his way out.  The locals believed, with
good reason, that Kuomintang officials made fortunes out of the
ex-collaborators.

Yang tried to protect himself by marrying off his remaining daughter,
whom he had had with one of his concubines, to a Kuomintang officer.
But this man was only a captain, not powerful enough to give him any
real protection.

Yang's property was confiscated and he was reduced to living as a
beggar 'squatting by open drains," as the locals called it.  When she
heard about this, his wife told-her children not to give him any money
or do anything to help him.

In 1947, a little more than a year after his release from jail, he
developed a cancerous goiter on his neck.  He realized he was dying and
sent word to Jinzhou begging to see his children.  My great-grandmother
refused, but he kept sending messages entreating them to come.  In the
end his wife relented.  My grandmother, Lan and Yu-lin set off for
Yixian by train.  It was ten years
since my grandmother had seen her father, and he was a crumpled shadow
of his former self.  Tears streamed down his cheeks when he saw his
children.  They found it hard to forgive him for the way he had treated
their mother and themselves and they spoke to him using rather distant
forms of address.  He pleaded with Yu-lin to call him Father, but
Yu-lin refused.

Yang's ravaged face was a mask of despair.  My grandmother begged her
brother to call him Father, just once.

Finally he did, through gritted teeth.  His father took his hand and
said: "Try to be a scholar, or run a small business.

Never try to be an official.  It will ruin you, the way it has ruined
me."  These were his last words to his family.

He died with only one of his concubines at his side.  He was so poor he
could not even afford a coffin.  His corpse was put in a battered old
suitcase and buried without ceremony.  Not one member of his family was
there.

Corruption was so widespread that Chiang Kai-shek set up a special
organization to combat it.  It was called the "Tiger-Beating Squad,"
because people compared corrupt officials to fearsome tigers, and it
invited citizens to send in their complaints.  But it soon became
apparent that this was a means for the really powerful to extort money
from the rich.

"Tiger-beating' was a lucrative job.

Much worse than this was the blatant looting.  Dr.  Xia was visited
every now and then by soldiers who would salute punctiliously and then
say in an exaggeratedly cringing voice: "Your honor Dr.  Xia, some of
our colleagues are very short of money.  Could you perhaps lend us
some?"  It was unwise to refuse.  Anyone who crossed the Kuomintang was
likely to be accused of being a Communist, which usually meant arrest,
and frequently torture.  Soldiers would also swagger into the surgery
and demand treatment and medicine without paying a penny.  Dr.  Xia did
not particularly mind giving them free medical treatment he regarded it
as a doctor's duty to treat anyone but the
soldiers would sometimes just take the medicine
without asking, and sell it on the black market.  Medicines were in
desperately short supply.

As the civil war intensified the number of soldiers in Jinzhou rose.
The troops of the central command, which came directly under Chiang
Kai-shek, were relatively well disciplined, but the others received no
pay from the central government and had to 'live off the land."

At the teacher training department my mother struck up a close
friendship with a beautiful, vivacious seventeen year-old girl called
Bai.  My mother admired her and looked up to her.  When she told Bai
about her disenchantment with the Kuomintang, Bai told her to 'look at
the forest, not the individual trees': any force was bound to have some
shortcomings, she said.  Bai was passionately pro-Kuomintang, so much
so that she had joined one of the intelligence services.  In a training
course it was made clear to her that she was expected to report on her
fellow students.  She refused.  A few nights later her colleagues in
the course heard a shot from her bedroom.  When they opened the door,
they saw her lying on her bed, gasping, her face deathly white.  There
was blood on her pillow.  She died without being able to say a word.
The newspapers published the story as what was called a 'peach-colored
case," meaning a crime of passion.  They claimed she had been murdered
by a jealous lover.  But nobody believed this.  Bai had behaved in a
very demure manner where men were concerned.  My mother heard that she
had been killed because she had tried to pull out.

The tragedy did not end there.  Bai's mother was working as a live-in
servant in the house of a wealthy family which owned a small gold shop.
She was heartbroken at the death of her only daughter, and incensed by
the scurrilous suggestions in the papers that her daughter had had
several lovers who had fought over her and eventually killed her.

A woman's most sacred possession was her chastity, which she was
supposed to defend to the death.  Several days after
Bai's death, her mother hanged
herself.  Her employer was visited by thugs who accused him of being
responsible for her death.  It was a good pretext to extort money, and
it did not take long for the man to lose his gold shop.  One day there
was a knock on the Xias' door and a man in his late thirties, dressed
in Kuomintang uniform, came in and bowed to my grandmother, addressing
her as 'elder sister' and Dr.  Xia as 'elder brother-in-law."  It took
them a moment to realize that this smartly dressed, healthy, well fed
man was Han-chen, who had been tortured and saved from the garrote, and
whom they had hidden in their old house for three months and nursed
back to health.  With him, also in uniform, was a tall, slender young
man who looked more like a college student than a soldier.  Hanchen
introduced him as his friend Zhu-ge.  My mother immediately took to
him.

Since their last encounter Han-chen had become a senior official in
Kuomintang intelligence, and was in charge of one of its branches for
the whole of Jinzhou.  As he left, he said: "Elder sister, I was given
back my life by your family.  If you ever need anything, anything at
all, all you have to do is say the word and it will be done."

Han-chen and Zhu-ge came to visit often, and Hanchen soon found jobs in
the intelligence apparatus for both Dong, the former executioner who
had saved his life, and my grandmother's brother-in-law Pei-o, the
former prison warder.

Zhu-ge became very friendly with the family.  He had been studying
science at university in Tianjin and had fled to join the Kuomintang
when the city had fallen into Japanese hands.  On one of his visits my
mother introduced him to Miss Tanaka, who had been living with the
Xias.

They hit it off, got married, and went to live in rented rooms.  One
day Zhu-ge was cleaning his gun when he accidentally touched the
trigger and the gun went off.  The bullet passed straight through the
floor and killed the landlord's youngest son, who was in bed
downstairs.  The family did not dare to bring a charge against Zhu-ge
because they were frightened of intelligence men, who could accuse
anyone they chose to of being a Communist.  Their word was law, and
they had the power of life and death.  Zhu-ge's mother gave the family
a large sum of money as compensation.  Zhu-ge was distraught, but the
family did not even dare show any anger toward him.  Instead, they
showed exaggerated gratitude, out of fear that he might anticipate that
they would be angry, and harm them.  He found this hard to bear, and
soon moved out.

Lan's husband, Uncle Pei-o, prospered in the intelligence system and
was so delighted with his new employers that he changed his name to
"Xiao-shek' ("Loyalty to Chiang Kai-shek').  He was a member of a
three-man group under Zhu-ge.  Initially their job was to purge anyone
who had been pro-Japanese, but very soon this slid into watching out
for students showing pro-Communist sympathies.  For a while, "Loyalty'
Pei-o did what was asked of him, but his conscience soon began to
trouble him; he did not want to be responsible for sending people to
prison or choosing victims for extortion.  He asked for a transfer and
was given a job as a watchman at one of the city checi/points.  The
Communists had left the city of Jinzhou but had not gone very far. They
were engaged in constant battles with the Kuomintang in the surrounding
countryside.  The Jinzhou authorities were trying to keep. tight
control over the most vital commodities to stop the Communists from
getting hold of them.

Being in intelligence gave "Loyalty' power, which brought him money.
Gradually he began to change.  He started smoking opium, drinking
heavily, gambling, and frequenting brothels, and soon contracted a
venereal disease.  My grandmother offered him money to try to get him
to behave, but he carried on as before.  However, he could see that
food was becoming increasingly scarce for the Xias, and often invited
them to good meals at his house.  Dr.  Xia would not let my grandmother
go.

"Those are ill-gotten

Ruled by Different Masters l 19 gains and we don't want to touch them,"
he said.  But the thought of some decent food was sometimes too strong
a temptation for my grandmother and occasionally she would sneak off to
the Pei-o house with Yu-lin and my mother for a square meal.

When the Kuomintang first came to Jinzhou Yu-lin was fifteen years old.
He had been studying medicine with Dr.  Xia, who thought he had a
promising future as a doctor.

By now my grandmother had taken on the position of the female head of
the family as her mother, sister, and brother were all dependent on her
husband for a living, and she felt it was time Yu-lin got married.  She
soon settled on a woman who was three years older than him and came
from a poor family, which meant she would be hard-working and capable.
My mother went with my grandmother to see the prospective bride; when
she came in to bow to the visitors in the sitting room, she was wearing
a green velvet gown which she had had to borrow for the occasion.  The
couple were married in a registry office in 1946, the bride wearing a
rented Western-style white silk veil.  Yu-lin was sixteen and his wife
was nineteen.

My grandmother asked Han-chen to find Yu-lin a job.

One of the vital commodities was salt, and the authorities had
forbidden selling it to the countryside.  Of course, they were running
a salt racket themselves.  Han-chen got Yulin a job as a salt guard,
and several times he was almost involved in serious skirmishes with
Communist guerrillas and other Kuomintang factions who were trying to
capture the salt.  Many people were being killed in the fighting.

Yu-lin found the job frightening, and was also tormented by his
conscience.  Within a few months he quit.

By this time, the Kuomintang was gradually losing control of the
countryside, and was finding it harder and harder to get recruits.
Young men were increasingly unwilling to become 'bomb ashes' (pao-hul).
The civil war had become much more bloody, with enormous casualties,
and the danger of being conscripted or simply impressed into the army
was growing.  The
only way to keep Yu-lin out of uniform was to buy him some form of
insurance, so my grandmother asked Han-chen to find him a job in
intelligence.  To her surprise, he refused, telling her it was no place
for a decent young man.

My grandmother did not realize that Han-chen was in deep despair about
his work.  Like "Loyalty' Pei-o he had become an opium addict, and was
drinking heavily and visiting prostitutes.  He was visibly wasting
away.  Han-chen had always been a self-disciplined man, with a strong
sense of morality, and it was most unlike him to let himself go in this
way.  My grandmother thought that the ancient remedy of marriage might
pull him around, but when she put this to him he said he could not take
a wife, because he did not want to live.  My grandmotfier was shocked,
and pressed him to tell her why, but Han-chen only started weeping and
said bitterly that he was not free to tell her, and that she could not
help anyway.

Han-chen had joined the Kuomintang because he hated the Japanese.  But
things had turned out differently from what he had envisaged.  Being
involved in the intelligence system meant that he could hardly avoid
having innocent blood of his' fellow Chinese on his hands.  But he
could not get out.  What had happened to my mother's college friend Bai
was what happened to anyone who tried to quit.

Han-chen probably felt that the only way out was to kill himself, but
suicide was a traditional gesture of protest and might bring trouble to
his family.  Han-chen must have come to the conclusion that the only
thing he could do was to die a 'natural' death, which was why he was
going to such wild extremes in abusing his body and why he refused to
take any treatment.

On the eve of Chinese New Year 1947 he returned to his family home in
Yixian to spend the festival period with his brother and his elderly
father.  As if he felt that this was to be their last meeting, he
stayed on.  He fell gravely ill, and died in the summer.  He had told
my grandmother that the only regret he would have in dying was not
being able to fulfill his filial duty and hold a grand funeral for his
father.

But he did not die without fulfilling his obligation to my grandmother
and her family.  Even though he refused to take Yu-lin into
intelligence work, he acquired an identity card for him which said he
was a Kuomintang intelligence official.  Yu-lin never did any work for
the intelligence system, but his membership guaranteed him against
being conscripted, and he was able to stay and help Dr.  Xia in the
medicine shop.

One of the teachers at my mother's school was a young man named Kang,
who taught Chinese literature.  He was very bright and knowledgeable,
and my mother respected him tremendously.  He told her.  and some other
girls that he had been involved in anti-Kuomintang activities in the
city of Kunming in southwest China, and that his girlfriend had been
killed by a hand grenade during a demonstration.

His lectures were clearly pro-Communist, and made a strong impression
on my mother.

One morning in early 1947 my mother was stopped at the school gate by
the old porter.  He handed her a note and told her that Kang had gone.
What my mother did not know was that Kang had been tipped off, as some
of the Kuomintang intelligence agents were secretly working for the
Communists.  At the time my mother did not know much about the
Communists, or that Kang was one of them.  All she knew was that the
teacher she most admired had had to flee because he was about to be
arrested.

The note was from Kang, and consisted of only one word: "Silence."  My
mother saw two possible meanings in this word.  It could refer to a
line from a poem Kang had written in memory of his girlfriend, "Silence
in which our strength is gathering," in which case it might be an
appeal not to lose heart.  But the note could also be a warning against
doing something impetuous.  My mother had by then established quite a
reputation for fearlessness, and she commanded support among the
students.  The next thing she knew a new headmistress arrived.  She was
a delegate to the National Congress of the Kuomintang, reputedly with
ties to the secret services.  She brought with her a number of
intelligence men, including one called Yao-han, who became the
political supervisor, with the special task of keeping a watch on the
students.

The academic supervisor was the district party secretary of the
Kuomintang.

My mother's closest friend at this time was a distant male cousin
called Hu.  His father owned a chain of department stores in Jinzhou,
Mukden, and Harbin, and had a wife and two concubines.  His wife had
produced a son, Cousin Hu, while the concubines had not.  Cousin Hu's
mother therefore became the object of intense jealousy on their part.
One night when her husband was out of the house the concubines drugged
her food and that of a young male servant, then put them into the same
bed.  When Mr.  Hu came back and found his wife, apparently blind
drunk, in bed with the servant, he went berserk; he locked his wife up
in a tiny room in a remote corner of the house, and forbade his son to
see her again.  He had a sneaking suspicion that the whole thing might
have been a plot by his concubines, so he did not disown his wife and
throw her out, which would have been the ultimate disgrace (to himself
as well as to her).  He was worried that the concubines might harm his
son, so he sent him away to boarding school in Jinzhou, which is how my
mother met him, when she was seven and he was twelve.  His mother soon
went mad in her solitary confinement.

Cousin Hu grew up to be a sensitive boy who kept to himself.  He never
got over what had happened, and occasionally talked to my mother about
it.  The story made my mother reflect on the blighted lives of women in
her own family and on the numerous tragedies that had happened to so
many other mothers, daughters, wives, and concubines.  The
powerlessness of women, the barbarity of the age-old customs, cloaked
in 'tradition' and even 'morality," enraged her.  Although there had
been changes, they were buried by the still overwhelming prejudice.  My
mother was impatient for something more radical.

In her school she learned that one political force had openly promised
change the Communists.  The information came from a close friend of
hers, an eighteen-year old girl called Shu who had broken with her
family and was staying in the school because her father had tried to
force her into an arranged marriage with a boy of twelve.

One day Shu bade farewell to my mother: she and the man she was
secretly in love with were running away to join the Communists.

"They are our hope," were her parting words.

It was about this time that my mother became very close to Cousin Hu,
who had realized that he was in love with her when he found that he was
very jealous of young Mr.  Liu, whom he regarded as a dandy.  He was
delighted when she broke up with Liu, and came to see my mother almost
every day.

One evening in March 1947 they went to the cinema together.  There were
two kinds of tickets: one for a seat;

the other, which was much cheaper, for standing only.

Cousin Hu bought my mother a seat, but a standing ticket for himself,
saying he did not have enough money on him.

My mother thought this was a bit odd, and so she stole a glance in his
direction every now and then.  Halfway through the film she saw a
smartly dressed young woman approach him, slide by him slowly, and
then, for a split second, their hands touched.  She got up at once and
insisted on leaving.  When they got outside she demanded an
explanation.  At first Cousin Hu tried to deny that anything had
happened; when my mother made it clear she was not going to swallow
this, he said he would explain later.  There were things my mother
could not understand, he said, because she was too young.  When they
reached her house, she
refused to let him in.  Over the next few days he called repeatedly,
but my mother would not see him.

After a while, she was ready for an apology and a reconciliation, and
would keep looking out toward the gate to see if he was there.  One
evening, when it was snowing hard, she saw him coming into the
courtyard accompanied by another man.  He did not make for her part of
the house, but went straight to where the Xias' tenant, a man called
Yu-wu, was living.  After a short time Hu reemerged and walked briskly
over to her room.  With an urgent edge to his voice, he told her he had
to leave Jinzhou immediately, as the police were after him.  When she
asked him why, all he said was, "I am a Communist," and disappeared
into the snowy night.

It dawned on my mother that the incident in the cinema must have been a
clandestine mission of Cousin Hu's.  She was heartbroken, as there was
now no time to make up with him.  She realized that their tenant,
Yu-wu, must also be an underground Communist.  The reason Cousin Hu had
been brought to Yu-wu's quarters was to hide there.

Cousin Hu and Yu-wu had not known each other's identity until this
evening.  Both of them realized it was out of the question for Cousin
Hu to stay there, as his relationship with my mother was too well
known, and if the Kuomintang came to the house to look for him Yu-wu
would be discovered as well.  That same night Cousin Hu tried to make
for the Communist-controlled area, which lay about twenty miles beyond
the city boundaries.  Some time later, as the first buds of spring were
bursting out, Yu-wu received news that Hu had been captured as he left
the city.  His escort had been shot dead.  A later report said Hu had
been executed.

My mother had been turning more and more strongly against the
Kuomintang for some time.  The only alternative she knew was the
Communists, and she had been particularly attracted by their promises
to put an end to
injustices against women.  Up to now,
at the age of fifteen, she had not felt ready to commit herself fully.
The news of Cousin Hu's death made her mind up.  She decided to join
the Communists.

5. "Daughter for Sale for 10 Kilos of Rice'

In Battle for a New China

(1947-1948)

Yu-wu had first appeared at the house some months earlier bearing an
introduction from a mutual friend.  The Xias had just moved from their
borrowed residence into a big house inside the walls near the north
gate, and had been looking for a rich tenant to help with the rent.
Yu-wu arrived wearing the uniform of a Kuomintang officer, accompanied
by a woman whom he presented as his wife and a young baby.  In fact,
the woman was not his wife but his assistant.  The baby was hers, and
her real husband was somewhere far away in the regular Communist
army.

Gradually this 'family' became a real one.  They later had two children
together and their original spouses remarried.

Yu-wu had joined the Communist Party in 1938.  He had been sent to
Jinzhou from the Communists' wartime headquarters, Yan'an, shortly
after the Japanese surrender, and was responsible for collecting and
delivering informarion to the Communist forces outside the city.  He
operated under the identity of a Kuomintang military bureau chief for
one of the districts of Jinzhou, a position the Communists had bought
for him.  At the time, posts in the Kuomintang, even in the
intelligence system, were virtually

In Battle ybr a New China 127 for sale to the highest bidder.  Some
people bought posts to protect their families from being forced into
the army and from harassment by thugs, others to be able to extort
money.  Because of its strategic importance, there were a great many
officers in Jinzhou, which facilitated the Como munist infiltration of
the system.

Yu-wu played his part to perfection.  He gave a lot of gambling and
dinner parties, par fly to make connections and partly to weave a
protective web around himself.

Mingled with the constant comings and goings of Kuomintang officers and
intelligence officials was an unending stream of 'cousins' and
'friends."  They were always different people, but nobody asked any
questions.

Yu-wu had another layer of cover for these frequent visitors.  Dr.
Xia's surgery was always open, and Yu-wu's 'friends' could walk in off
the street without attracting attention, and then go through the
surgery to the inner courtyard.  Dr.  Xia tolerated Yu-wu's rowdy
parties without demur, even though his sect, the Society of Reason,
forbade gambling and drinking.  My mother was puzzled, but put it down
to her stepfather's tolerant nature.  It was only years later when she
thought back that she felt certain that Dr.  Xia had known, or guessed,
Yu-wu's real identity.

When my mother heard that her cousin Hu had been killed by the
Kuomintang she approached Yu-wu about working for the Communists.  He
turned her down, on the grounds that she was too young.

My mother had become quite prominent at her school and she was hoping
that the Communists would approach her.  They did, but they took their
time checking her out.

In fact, before leaving for the Communist-controlled area, her friend
Shu had told her own Communist contact about my mother, and had
introduced him to her as 'a friend'.

One day, this man came to her and told her out of the blue to go on a
certain day to a railway tunnel halfway between the Jinzhou south
station and the north station.

128 "Daughter JSr Sale Jbr i o Kilos of Rice' There, he said, a
good-looking man in his mid-twenties with a Shanghai accent would
contact her.  This man, whose name she later discovered was Liang,
became her controller.

Her first job was to distribute literature like Mao Zedong's On
Coalition Government, and pamphlets on land reform and other Communist
policies.  These had to be smuggled into the city, usually hidden in
big bundles of sorghum stalks which were to be used for fuel.  The
pamphlets were then repacked, often rolled up inside big green
peppers.

Sometimes Yu-lin's wife would buy the peppers and keep a lookout in the
street when my mother's associates came to collect the literature.  She
also helped hide the pamphlets in the ashes of various stoves, heaps of
Chinese medicines, or piles of fuel.  The students had to read this
literature in secret, though left-wing novels could be read more or
less openly: among the favorites was Maksim Gorky's Mother.

One day a copy of one of the pamphlets my mother had been distributing,
Mao's On New Democracy, ended up with a rather absent-minded
schoolfriend of hers, who put it in her bag and forgot about it.  When
she went to the market she opened her bag to get some money and the
pamphlet dropped out.  Two intelligence men happened to be there and
identified it from its flimsy yellow paper.  The girl was taken off and
interrogated.  She died under torture.

Many people had died at the hands of Kuomintang intelligence, and my
mother knew that she risked torture if she was caught.  This incident,
far from daunting her, only made her feel more defiant.  Her morale was
also boosted enormously by the fact that she now felt herself pan of
the Communist movement.

Manchuria was the key battleground in the civil war, and what happened
in Jinzhou was becoming more and more critical to the outcome of the
whole struggle for China.  There was no fixed front, in the sense of a
single

In Battle For a New China i 2~ battle line.  The Communists held the
northern part of Manchuria and much of the countryside; the Kuomintang
held the main cities, except for Harbin in the north, plus the seaports
and most of the railway lines.  By the end of 1947, for the first time,
the Communist armies in the area outnumbered those of their opponents;
during that year they had put over 300,000 Kuomintang troops out of
action.  Many peasants were joining the Communist army, or swinging
their support behind the Communists.  The single most important reason
was that the Communists had carried out a land-to-the-filler reform and
the peasants felt that backing them was the way to keep their land.

At the time the Communists controlled much of the area around Jinzhou.
Peasants were reluctant to enter the city to sell their produce because
they had to go through Kuomintang checkpoints where they were harassed:
exorbitant fees were extorted, or they simply had their products
confiscated.  The grain price in the city was rocketing upwards almost
day by day, made worse by the manipulation of greedy merchants and
corrupt officials.

When the Kuomintang first arrived, they had issued a new currency known
as the "Law money."  But they proved unable to control inflation.  Dr.
Xia had always been worried about what would happen to my grandmother
and my mother when he died and he was now nearly eighty.  He had been
putting his savings into the new money because he had faith in the
government.  After a time the Law money was replaced by another
currency, the Golden Yuan, which soon became worth so little that when
my mother wanted to pay her school fees she had to hire a rickshaw to
carry the huge pile of notes (to 'save face' Chiang Kai-shek refused to
print any note bigger than 10,000 yuan).  Dr.  Xia's entire savings
were gone.

The economic situation deteriorated steadily through the winter of
1947-48.  Protests against food shortages and price gouging multiplied.
Jinzhou was the key supply base for the large Kuomintang armies farther
north, and in x3o "Daughter for Sale Jbr I o Kilos of Rice'
mid-December 1947 a crowd of 20,000 people raided two well-stocked
grain stores.

One trade was prospering: trafficking in young girls for brothels and
as slave-servants to rich men.  The city was littered with beggars
offering their children in exchange for food.  For days outside her
school my mother saw an emaciated, desperate-looking woman in rags
slumped on the frozen ground.  Next to her stood a girl of about ten
with an expression of numb misery on her face.  A sack was poking up
out of the back of her collar and on it was a poorly written sign
saying "Daughter for sale for io kilos of rice."

Among those who could not make ends meet were the teachers.  They had
been demanding a pay rise, to which the government responded by
increasing tuition fees.  This had lit He effect, because the parents
could not afford to pay more.  A teacher at my mother's school died of
food poisoning after eating a piece of meat he had picked up off the
street.  He knew the meat was rotten, but he was so hungry he thought
he would take a chance.

By now my mother had become the president of the students' union.  Her
Party controller, Liang, had given her instructions to try to win over
the teachers as well as the students, and she set about organizing a
campaign to get people to donate money for the teaching staff.  She and
some other girls would go to cinemas and theaters and before the
performances started they would appeal for donations.  They also put on
song-and-dance shows and ran rummage sales, but the returns were paltry
people were either too poor or too mean.

One day she bumped into a friend of hers who was the granddaughter of a
brigade commander and was married to a Kuomintang officer.  The friend
told her there was going to be a banquet that evening for about fifty
officers and their wives in a smart restaurant in town.  In those days
there was a lot of entertaining going on among Kuomintang officials. My
mother raced off to her school and contacted as many people as she
could.  She told them to gather at 5 p.m. in front of the city's most
prominent landmark, the sixty-foot-high eleventh-century stone drum
tower.  When she got there, at the head of a sizable contingent, there
were over a hundred girls waiting for her orders.  She told them her
plan.  At around six o'clock they saw large numbers of officers
arriving in carriages and rickshaws.

The women were dressed to the nines, wearing silk and satin and
jingling with jewelry.

When my mother judged that the diners would be well into their food and
drink, she and some of the girls filed into the restaurant.  Kuomintang
decadence was such that security was unbelievably lax.  My mother
climbed onto a chair, her simple dark-blue cotton gown making her the
image of austerity among the brightly, embroidered silks and jewels.
She made a brief speech about how hard up the teachers were, and
finished with the words: "We all know you are generous people.  You
must be very pleased to have this opportunity to open your pockets and
show your generosity."

The officers were in a spot.  None of them wanted to look mean.  In
fact, they more or less had to try to show off.

And, of course, they wanted to get rid of the unwelcome intruders.  The
girls went round the heavily laden tables and made a note of each
officer's contribution.  Then, first thing next morning, they went
round to the officers' homes and collected their pledges.  The teachers
were enormously grateful to the girls, who delivered the money to them
right away, so it could be used before its value was wiped out, which
would be within hours.

There was no retribution against my mother, perhaps because the diners
were ashamed of being caught like this, and did not want to bring
further embarrassment on themselves although, of course, the whole town
knew about it at once.  My mother had successfully turned the rules of
the game against them.  She was appalled by the casual extravagance of
the Kuomintang elite while people were
starving to death in the streets and this made her even more
committed to the Communists.

As food was the problem inside the city, so clothing was in desperately
short supply outside, as the Kuomintang had placed a ban on selling
textiles to the countryside.  As a watchman on the gates, "Loyalty'
Pei-o's main job was to stop textiles being smuggled out of the city
and sold to the Communists.  The smugglers were a mixture of black
marketeers, men working for Kuomintang officials, and underground
Communists.

The usual procedure was that "Loyalty' and his colleagues would stop
the carts and confiscate the cloth, then release the smuggler in the
hope that he would come back with another load which they could also
seize.  Sometimes they had a deal with the smugglers for a
percentage.

Whether they had a deal or not, the guards would sell the cloth to the
Communist-controlled areas anyway.

"Loyalty' and his colleagues waxed fat.

One night a dirty, nondescript cart rolled up at the gate where
"Loyalty' was on duty.  He performed his customary charade, poking the
pile of cloth on the back while he swaggered around, hoping to
intimidate the driver and soften him up for an advantageous deal.  As
he sized up the value of the load and the likely resistance of the
driver, he was also hoping to engage him in conversation and find out
who his employer was.

"Loyalty' took his time because this was a big consignment, more than
he could get out of the city before dawn.

He got up beside the driver and ordered him to turn around and take the
consignment back into the city.  The driver, accustomed to being on the
receiving end of ~irbitrary instructions, did as he was told.

My grandmother was sound asleep in bed when she heard banging on the
door at about 1 a.m. When she opened it, she found "Loyalty' standing
there.  He said he wanted to leave the cartload at the house for the
night.  My grandmother had to agree, because the Chinese tradition made
it virtually impossible to say no to a relation.  The obligation to
one's family and relatives always took precedence over one's own moral
judgment.  She did not tell Dr.  Xia, who was still asleep.

Well before daybreak "Loyalty' reappeared with two cans; he transferred
the consignment onto them and drove off just as dawn was beginning to
light up the sky.  Less than half an hour later armed police appeared
and cordoned off the house.  The cart driver, who had been working for
another intelligence system, had informed his patrons.

Naturally, they wanted their merchandise back.

Dr.  Xia and my grandmother were quite put out, but at least the goods
had disappeared.  For my mother, though, the raid was almost a
catastrophe.  She had some Communist leaflets hidden in the house, and
as soon as the police appeared, she grabbed the leaflets and raced to
the toilet, where she pushed them down her padded trousers which were
tightened round the ankles to conserve heat, and put on a heavy winter
coat.  Then she sauntered out as nonchalantly as she could, pretending
she was on her way to school.  The policemen stopped her and said they
were going to search her.  She screamed at them that she would tell her
"Uncle' Zhu-ge how they had treated her.

Up to that moment the policemen had had no idea about the family's
intelligence connections.  Nor had they any idea who had confiscated
the textiles.  The administration of Jinzhou was in utter confusion
because of the enormous number of different Kuomintang units stationed
in the city and because anyone with a gun and some sort of protection
enjoyed arbitrary power.  When "Loyalty' and his men had appropriated
this load the driver did not ask them who they were working for.

The moment my mother mentioned Zhu-ge's name, there was a change in the
attitude of the officer.  Zhu-ge was a friend of his boss.  At a
signal, his subordinates lowered their guns and dropped their
insolently challenging manner.  The officer bowed stiffly and muttered
profuse apologies for
disturbing such an august family.  The rank and-file police looked even
more disappointed than their commander no booty meant no money, and no
money meant no food.  They shambled off sullenly, dragging their feet
as they went.

At the time there was a new university, the Northeast Exile University,
in Jinzhou, formed around students and teachers who had fled
Communist-occupied northern Manchuria.  Communist policies there had
often been harsh: many landowners had been killed.  In the towns, even
small factory owners and shopkeepers were denounced and their property
was confiscated.  Most intellectuals came from relatively well-to-do
families, and many had seen their families suffer under Communist rule
or been denounced themselves.

There was a medical college in the Exile University, and my mother
wanted to get into it.  It had always been her ambition to be a doctor.
This was partly Dr.  Xia's influence and partly because the medical
profession offered a woman the best chance of independence.  Liang
endorsed the idea enthusiastically.  The Party had plans for her.  She
enrolled in the medical college on a part-time basis in February
1948.

The Exile University was a battleground where the Kuomintang and the
Communists competed fiercely for influence.  The Kuomintang could see
how badly it was doing in Manchufig and was actively encouraging
students and intellectuals to flee farther south.  The Communists did
not want to lose these educated people.  They modified their land
reform program, and issued an order that urban capitalists were to be
well treated and intellectuals from well to-do families protected.
Armed with these more moderate policies, the Jinzhou underground set
out to persuade the students and teachers to stay on.  This became my
mother's main activity.

In spite of the Communists' policy switch, some students and teachers
decided it was safer to flee.  One shipload of students sailed to the
city of Tianjin, about 25o miles to the southwest, at the end of June.
When they arrived there they found that there was no food and nowhere
for them to stay.  The local Kuomintang urged them to join the army.

"Fight back to your homeland!"  they were told.

This was not what they had fled Manchuria for.  Some Communist
underground workers who had sailed with them encouraged them to take a
stand, and on 5 July the students demonstrated in the center of Tianjin
for food and accommodations.  Troops opened fire and scores of students
were injured, some seriously, and a number were killed.

When the news reached Jinzhou, my mother immediately decided to
organize support for the students who had gone to Tianjin.  She called
a meeting of the heads of the student unions of all the seven high and
technical schools, which voted to set up the Jinzhou Federation of
Student Unions.  My mother was elected to the chair.  They decided to
send a telegram of solidarity to the students in Tianjin and to stage a
march to the headquarters of General Chill, the martial law commander,
to present a petition.

My mother's friends were waiting anxiously at school for instructions.
It was a gray, rainy day and the ground had turned to sticky mud.
Darkness fell and there was still no sign of my mother and the other
six student leaders.  Then the news came that the police had raided the
meeting and taken them away.  They had been informed on by Yao-han, the
political supervisor at my mother's school.

They were marched to the martial law headquarters.

After a while, General Chill strode into the room.  He faced them
across a table and started to talk to them in a patient, paternalistic
tone of voice, apparently more in sorrow than in anger.  They were
young and liable to do rash things, he said.  But what did they know
about politics?  Did they realize they were being used by the
Communists? They should x36 "Daughter Jbr Sale for l o Kilos of Rice'
stick to their books.  He said he would release them if they would sign
a confession admitting their mistakes and identifying the Communists
behind them.  Then he paused to watch the effect of his words.

My mother found his lecturing and his whole attitude insufferable.  She
stepped forward and said in a loud voice:

"Tell us, Commander, what mistake have we made?"  The general became
irritated: "You were used by the Communist bandits to stir up trouble.
Isn't that mistake enough?"

My mother shouted back: "What Communist bandits?  Our friends died in
Tianjin because they had run away from the Communists, on your advice.
Do they deserve to be shot by you?  Have we done anything
unreasonable?"  After some fierce exchanges the general banged his fist
on the table and bellowed for his guards.

"Show her around," he said, and then, turning to my mother, "You need
to realize where you are!"  Before the soldiers could seize her, my
mother leaped forward and banged her fist on the table:

"Wherever I may be, I have not done anything wrong!"

The next thing my mother knew she was held tight by both arms and
dragged away from the table.  She was pulled along a corridor and down
some stairs into a dark room.

On the far side she could see a man dressed in rags.  He seemed to be
sitting on a bench and leaning against a pillar.

His head was lolling to one side.  Then my mother realized that he was
tied to the pillar and his thighs were tied to the bench.  Two men were
pushing bricks under his heels.

Each additional brick brought forth a deep, stifled groan.

My mother felt her head was filled with blood, and she thought she
heard the cracking of bones.  The next thing she knew she was looking
into another room.  Her guide, an officer, drew her attention to a man
almost next to where they were standing.  He was hanging from a wooden
beam by his wrists and was naked from the waist upward.

His hair hung down in a tangled mess, so that my mother could not see
his face.  On the floor was a brazier, with a man sit ling beside it
casually smoking a cigarette.  As my mother watched, he lifted an iron
bar out of the fire; the tip was the size of a man's fist and was
glowing red-hot With a grin, he plunged it into the chest of the man
hanging from the beam.  My mother heard a sharp scream of pain and a
horrible sizzling sound, saw smoke coming from the wound, and could
smell the heavy odor of burned flesh.

But she did not scream or faint.  The horror had aroused in her a
powerful, passionate rage which gave her enormous strength and overrode
any fear.

The officer asked her if she would now write a confession.  She
refused, repeating that she knew of no Communists behind her.  She was
bundled into a small room which contained a bed and some sheets.  There
she spent several long days, listening to the screams of people being
tortured in rooms nearby, and refusing repeated demands to name
names.

Then one day she was taken to a yard at the back of the building,
covered with weeds and rubble, and ordered to stand against a high
wall.  Next to her a man who had obviously been tortured and could
barely stand was propped up.  Several soldiers lazily took their
positions.  A man blindfolded her.  Even though she could not see, she
closed her eyes.  She was ready to die, proud that she was giving her
life for a great cause.

She heard shots, but felt nothing.  After a minute or so her blindfold
was removed and she looked around, blinking.  The man who had been
standing next to her was lying on the ground.  The officer who had
taken her down to the dungeons came over, grinning.  One eyebrow was
raised in surprise that this seventeen-year-old girl was not a
gibbering wreck.  My mother told him calmly that she had nothing to
confess.

She was taken back to her cell.  Nobody bothered her, and she was not
tortured.  After a few more days she was set free.  During the previous
week the Communist underground had been busy pulling strings.  My
grandmother had been to the martial law headquarters every day, weep
x38 "Daughter Jbr Sale Jbr l o Kilos of Rice' ing, pleading, and
threatening suicide.  Dr.  Xia had visited his most powerful patients,
bearing expensive gifts.  The family's intelligence connections were
also mobilized.

Many people had vouched for my mother in wrifng, saying that she was
not a Communist, she was just young and impetuous.

What had happened to her did not daunt her in the slightest.  The
moment she came out of prison she set about organizing a memorial
service for the dead students in Tianjin.  The authorities gave
permission for the service.

There was great anger in Jinzhou about what had happened to the young
people who had, after all, left on the government's advice.  At the
same time, the schools hurriedly announced an early end to the term,
scrapping examinations, in the hope that the students would go home and
disband.

At this point the underground advised its members to leave for the
Communist-controlled areas.  Those who did not want to, or could not
leave, were ordered to suspend their clandestine work.  The Kuomintang
was clamping down fiercely, and too many operatives were being arrested
and executed.  Liang was leaving, and he asked my mother to go too, but
my grandmother would not allow it.  My mother was not suspected of
being a Communist, she said, but if she left with the Communists she
would be.  And what about all the people who had vouched for her?  If
she went now they would all be in trouble.

So she stayed.  But she was longing for action.  She turned to Yu-wu,
the only person left in the city who she knew was working for the
Communists.  Yu-wu did not know Liang or my mother's other contacts.
They belonged to different underground systems, which operated
completely separately, so that if anyone was caught and could not
withstand torture they could only reveal a limited number of names.

Jinzhou was the key supply and logistic center for all the Kuomintang
armies in the northeast.  They numbered over half a million men, strung
out along vulnerable railway lines and concentrated in a few shrinking
areas around the main cities.  By the summer of 1948 there were about
200,000 Kuomintang troops in Jinzhou, under several different commands.
Chiang Kai-shek had been squabbling with many of his top generals,
juggling the commands, which created severe demoralization.  The
different forces were badly coordinated and often distrusted one
another.

Many strategists, including his senior American advisers, thought that
Chiang should abandon Manchuria completely.  The key to any pullout,
'voluntary' or forced, by sea or by rail, was the retention of Jinzhou.
The city was only a hundred miles north of the Great Wall, quite near
to China proper, where the Kuomintang position still seemed relatively
secure, and it was easily reinforced from the sea Huludao was only
about thirty miles to the south, and was linked by a seemingly secure
railway.

In spring 1948 the Kuomintang had begun to construct a new defense
system around Jinzhou, made of cement blocks encased in steel frames.
The Communists, they thought, had no tanks and poor artillery, and no
experience attacking heavily fortified positions.  The idea was to ring
the city with self-contained fortresses, each of which could operate as
an independent unit even if it was surrounded.

The fortresses were to be connected by trenches six feet wide and six
feet deep, protected by a continuous fence of barbed wire.  The supreme
commander in Manchuria, General Wei Li-huang, came on an inspection
visit and declared the system impregnable.

But the project was never finished, par fly due to lack of materials
and poor planning, but mainly because of corruption.  The man in charge
of the construction work siphoned off building materials and sold them
on the black market;

the workers were not paid enough to eat.  By September, when the
Communist forces began to cut the city off, only a third of the system
had been completed, much of it small,

x4o "Daughter for Sale Jbr ~ o Kilos of Rice' unconnected cement forts.
Other parts had been has lily assembled from mud taken from the old
city wall.

It was vital for the Communists to know about this system and about the
disposition of the Kuomintang troops.  The Communists were building up
enormous forces about a quarter of a million men for a decisive battle.
The commander in chief of all the Communist armies, Zhu De, cabled the
commander on the spot, Lin Biao: "Take Jinzhou ... and the whole
Chinese situation is in our hands."  Yu-wu's group was asked to provide
up-to-date information before the final attack.

He urgently needed more hands, and when my mother approached him asking
for work, he and his superiors were delighted.

The Communists had sent some officers into the city in disguise to
reconnoiter, but a man wandering around the outskirts alone would
immediately attract attention.  An amorous couple would be much less
conspicuous.  By then, Kuomintang rule had made it quite acceptable for
young men and women to be seen together in public.  Because the
reconnaissance officers were male, my mother would be ideal as a
'girlfriend."

Yu-wu told her to be at an appointed place at a particular time.  She
was to wear a pale-blue gown and a red silk flower in her hair.  The
Communist officer would be carrying a copy of the Kuomintang newspaper,
the Central Daily folded into a triangle, and would identify himself by
wiping sweat three times off the left side of his face and then three
times off the right.

On the appointed day, my mother went to a small temple just outside the
old north wall but within the defense perimeter.  A man carrying the
triangular newspaper came up to her and gave the correct signals.  My
mother stroked his right cheek three times with her right hand, then he
stroked her left cheek three times with his left hand.  Then my mother
took his arm, and they walked off.

My mother did not understand fully what he was doing,

In Battle for a New China x4x and she did not ask.  Most of the time
they walked in silence, only talking when they passed someone.  The
mission passed off without incident.

There were to be more, around the city outskirts and to the railway,
the vital communications artery.

It was one thing to obtain the information, but it was another to get
it out of the city.  By the end of July the checkpoints were firmly
shut, and anyone trying to enter or leave was thoroughly searched.
Yu-wu consulted my mother, whose ability and courage he had grown to
trust.

The vehicles of senior officers could go in and out without being
searched, and my mother thought of a contact she might be able to use.
One of her fellow students was the granddaughter of a local army
commander, General Ji, and the girl's brother was a colonel in their
grandfather's brigade.

The Jis were a Jinzhou family, with considerable influence.  They
occupied a whole street, nicknamed "Ji Street," where they had a large
compound with an extensive, well groomed garden.  My mother had often
strolled in the garden with her friend, and was quite friendly with her
brother, Hui-ge.

Hui-ge was a handsome young man in his mid-twenties who had a
university degree in engineering.  Unlike many young men from wealthy,
powerful families, he was not a dandy.  My mother liked him, and the
feeling was mutual.

He began to pay social calls on the Xias and to invite my mother to tea
parties.  My grandmother liked him a lot; he was extremely courteous,
and she considered him highly eligible.

Soon Hui-ge started to invite my mother out on her own.  At first his
sister accompanied him, pretending to be a chaperone, but soon she
would disappear with some flimsy excuse.  She praised her brother to my
mother, adding that he was their grandfather's favorite.  She must also
have told her brother about my mother, because my mother discovered
that he knew a lot about her, including the fact x42 "Daughter for Sale
for zo Kilos of Rice' that she had been arrested for her radical
activities.  They found they had much in common.  Hui-ge was very frank
about the Kuomintang.  Once or twice he tugged at his colonel's uniform
and sighed that he hoped the war would end soon so he could go back to
his engineering.  He told my mother he thought the Kuomintang's days
were numbered, and she had the feeling that he was baring his innermost
thoughts.

She was certain he was fond of her, but she wondered if there might be
political motives behind his actions.  She deduced that he must be
trying to get a message across to her, and through her to the
Communists.  The message had to be: I don't like the Kuomintang, and I
am willing to help you.

They became tacit conspirators.  One day my mother suggested that he
might surrender to the Communists with some troops (which was a fairly
common occurrence).  He said he was only a staff officer and did not
command any troops.  My mother asked him to try to persuade his
grandfather to go over, but he replied sadly that the old man would
probably have him shot if he even suggested it.

My mother kept Yu-wu informed, and he told her to cultivate Hui-ge.
Soon Yu-wu told her to ask Hui-ge to take her for a trip outside the
city in his jeep.  They went on such trips three or four times, and
each time, when they reached a primitive mud toilet, she said she had
to use it.

She got out and hid a message in a hole in the toilet wall while he
waited in his jeep.  He never asked any questions.

His conversations became more and more centered on his worries about
his family and himself.  In a roundabout way, he hinted that the
Communists might execute him: "I'm afraid I'll soon just be a
disembodied soul outside the western gate?"  (The Western Heaven was
supposed to be the destination of the dead, because it was the site of
eternal peace.  So the execution ground in Jinzhou, like most places in
China, was outside the western gate.) When

In Battle for a New China i 43 he said this, he would look
questioningly into my mother's eyes, clearly inviting contradiction.

My mother felt certain that because of what he had done for them the
Communists would spare him.  Although everything had been implicit, she
would say confidently:

"Don't think such gloomy thoughts?"  or "I'm sure that won't happen to
you!"

The Kuomintang position continued to deteriorate through the late
summer- and not only because of military action.  Corruption wreaked
havoc.  Inflation had risen to the unimaginable figure of just over
100,000 percent by the end of 1947 and it was to go to 2,870,000
percent by the end of 1948 in the Kuomintang areas.  The price of
sorghum, the main grain available, increased seventy fold overnight in
Jinzhou.  For the civilian population the situation was becoming more
desperate every day, as increasingly more food went to the army, much
of which was sold by local commanders on the black market.

The Kuomintang high command was divided over strategy.  Chiang Kai-shek
recommended abandoning Mukden, the largest city in Manchuria, and
concentrating on holding Jinzhou, but he was unable to impose a
coherent strategy on his top generals.  He seemed to place all his hope
on greater American intervention.  Defeatism permeated his top staff.

By September the Kuomintang held only three strongholds in Manchuria
Mukden, Changchun (the old capital of Manchukuo, Hsinking), and Jinzhou
and the 3o0 miles of railway track linking them.  The Communists were
encircling all three cities simultaneously, and the Kuomintang did not
know where the main attack would come.  In fact it was to be Jinzhou,
the most southerly of the three and the strategic key, because once it
fell the other two would be cut off from their supplies.  The
Communists were able to move large numbers of troops around undetected,
but the Kuomintang were dependent on the railway,
which was under constant
attack, and, to a lesser extent, on air transport.

The assault on Jinzhou began on 11 September 1948.

An American diplomat, John F. Melby, flying to Mukden, recorded in his
diary on 23 September: "North along the corridor to Manchuria the
Communist artillery was systematically making rubble out of the
airfield at Chinchow [Jinzhou]."  The next day, 24 September, the
Communist forces moved closer.  Twenty-four hours later Chiang Kaishek
ordered General Wei Li-huang to break out of Mukden with fifteen
divisions and relieve Jinzhou.  General Wei dithered, and by 26
September the Communists had virtually isolated Jinzhou.

By 1 October the encirclement of Jinzhou was completed.  Yixian, my
grandmother's hometown twenty-five miles to the north, fell that day.
Chiang Kai-shek flew to Mukden to take personal command.  He ordered
seven extra divisions to be thrown into the Jinzhou battle, but he was
unable even to get General Wei to move out of Mukden until 9 October,
two weeks after the order had been given and even then with only eleven
divisions, not fifteen.  On 6 October Chiang Kai-shek flew to Huludao
and ordered troops there to move up to relieve Jinzhou.

Some did, but piecemeal, and they were soon isolated and destroyed.

The Communists were getting ready to turn the assault on Jinzhou into a
siege.  Yu-wu approached my mother and asked her to undertake a
critical mission: to smuggle detonators into one of the ammunition
depots the one supplying Hui-ge's own division.  The ammunition was
stored in a big courtyard, the walls of which were tolaped with barbed
wire which was reputed to be electrified.

Everyone who went in and out was searched.  The soldiers living inside
the complex spent most of their time gambling and drinking.  Sometimes
prostitutes were brought in and the officers would hold a dance in a
makeshift club.  My mother told Hui-ge she wanted to go and have a look
at the dancing, and he agreed without asking any questions.

The detonators were handed to my mother the next day by a man she had
never seen.  She put them into her bag and drove into the depot with
Hui-ge.  They were not searched.  When they got inside, she asked
Hui-ge to show her around, leaving her bag in the car, as she had been
instructed.  Once they were out of sight, underground operatives were
supposed to remove the detonators.  My mother strolled at a
deliberately leisurely pace to give the men more time.  Hui-ge was
happy to oblige.

That night, the city was rocked by a gigantic explosion.

Detonations went off in chain reactions and the dynamite and shells lit
up the sky like a spectacular fireworks display.

The street where the depot had been was in flames.

Windows were shattered within a radius of about fifty yards.  The next
morning, Hui-ge invited my mother over to the Ji mansion.  His eyes
were hollow and he was unshaven.  He had obviously not slept a wink. He
greeted her a little more guardedly than usual.

After a heavy silence, he asked her whether she had heard the news. Her
expression must have confirmed his worst fears that he had helped to
cripple his own division.

He said there was going to be an investigation.

"I wonder whether the explosion will sweep my head from my shoulders,"
he sighed, 'or blow a reward my way?"  My mother, who was feeling sorry
for him, said reassuringly: "I am sure you are beyond suspicion.  I'm
certain you will be rewarded."  At this, Hui-ge stood up and saluted
her in formal fashion.

"Thank you for your promise!"  he said.

By now, Communist artillery shells had begun to crash into the city.
When my mother first heard the whine of the shells flying over, she was
a lit He frightened.  But later, when the shelling became heavier, she
got used to it.  It became like permanent thunder.  A kind of
fatalistic indifference deadened fear for most people.  The siege also
broke down Dr.  Xia's rigid Manchu ritual; for the first time the whole
household ate together, men and women,

x46 "Daughter Jbr Sale for I o Kilos of Rice' masters and servants.
Previously, they had been eating in no less than eight groups, all
having different food.  One day, as they were sitting around the table
preparing to have dinner, a shell came bursting through the window over
the kang, where Yu-lin's one-year-old son was playing, and thudded to a
halt under the dining table.  Fortunately, like many of the shells, it
was a dud.

Once the siege started there was no food to be had, even on the black
market.  A hundred million Kuomintang dollars could barely buy a pound
of sorghum.  Like most families who could afford to do so, my
grandmother had stored some sorghum and soybeans, and her sister's
husband, "Loyalty' Pei-o, used his connections to get some extra
supplies.  During the siege the family's donkey was killed by a piece
of shrapnel, so they ate it.

On 8 October the Communists moved almost a quarter of a million troops
into attack positions.  The shelling became much more intense.  It was
also very accurate.  The top Kuomintang commander, General Fan Han-jie,
said that it seemed to follow him wherever he went.  Many artillery
positions were knocked out, and the fortresses in the uncompleted
defense system came under heavy fire, as did the road and railway
links.  Telephone and cable lines were cut, and the electricity system
broke down.

On 13 October the outer defenses collapsed.  More than 100,000
Kuomintang troops retreated pell-mell into the center of the city. That
night a band of about a dozen disheveled soldiers stormed into the
Xias' house and demanded food.  They had not eaten for two days.  Dr.
Xia greeted them courteously and Yu-lin's wife immediately started
cooking a huge saucepan of sorghum noodles.

When they were ready, she put them on the kitchen table and went into
the next room to tell the soldiers.  As she turned her back, a shell
landed in the saucepan and exploded, spattering the noodles all over
the kitchen.  She dived under a narrow table in front of the kang.  A
soldier was ahead of her, but she grabbed him by the leg and

pulled him out.  My grandmother was terrified.

"What if he had turned around and pulled the trigger?"  she hissed once
he was out of earshot.

Until the very final stage of the siege the shelling was amazingly
accurate; few ordinary houses were hit, but the population suffered
from the terrible fires which the shelling ignited, and there was no
water to douse the flames.

The sky was completely obscured by thick, dark smoke and it was
impossible to see more than a few yards, even in daytime.  The noise of
the artillery was deafening.  My mother could hear people wailing, but
could never tell where they were or what was happening.

On 14 October, the final offensive started.  Nine hundred artillery
pieces bombarded the city nonstop.  Most of the family hid in an
improvised air-raid shelter which they had dug earlier, but Dr.  Xia
refused to leave the house.  He sat calmly on the kang in the corner of
his room by the window and prayed silently to the Buddha.  At one point
fourteen kittens ran into the room.  He was delighted: "A place a cat
tries to hide in is a lucky place," he said.  Not a single bullet came
into his room and all the kittens survived.  The only other person who
would not go down into the shelter was my great-grandmother, who just
curled up under the oak table next to the kang in her room.  When the
bat He ended the thick quilts and blankets covering the table looked
like a sieve.

In the middle of one bombardment, Yu-lin's baby son, who was down in
the shelter, wanted to have a wee-wee.

His mother took him outside, and a few seconds later the side of the
shelter where she had been sitting collapsed.

My mother and grandmother had to come up and take cover in the house.
My mother crouched next to the kang in the kitchen, but soon pieces of
shrapnel started hitting the brick side of the kang and the house began
to shake.

She ran out into the back garden.  The sky was black with smoke.
Bullets were flying through the air and ricocheting all over the place,
spattering against the walls; the sound
was like mighty rain pelting down, mixed with screams
and yells.

In the small hours of the next day a group of Kuomintang soldiers burst
into the house, dragging about twenty terrified civilians of all ages
with them the residents of the three neighboring courtyards.  The
troops were almost hysterical.  They had come from an arfllery post in
a temple across the street, which had just been shelled with pinpoint
accuracy, and were shouting at the civilians that one of them must have
given away their position.  They kept yelling that they wanted to know
who had given the signal.

When no one spoke up, they grabbed my mother and shoved her against a
wall, accusing her.  My grandmother was terrified, and hurriedly dug
out some small gold pieces and pressed them into the soldiers' hands.
She and Dr.  Xia went down on their knees and begged the soldiers to
let my mother go.  Yu-lin's wife said this was the only time she ever
saw Dr.  Xia looking really frightened.  He pleaded with the soldiers:
"She's my little girl.  Please believe me that she did not do it ....
'

The soldiers took the gold and let my mother go, but they forced
everyone into two rooms at bayonet point and shut them in so they would
not send any more signals, they said.  It was pitch-dark inside the
rooms, and very frightening.  But quite soon my mother noticed that the
shelling was decreasing.  The noises outside changed.

Mixed with the whine of bullets were sounds of hand grenades exploding
and the clash of bayonets.  Voices were yelling, "Put down your weapons
and we'll spare your life!"

there were blood-curdling shrieks and screams of anger and pain.  Then
the shots and the shouts came closer and closer, and she heard the
sound of boots clattering on the cobblestones as the Kuomintang
soldiers ran away down the street.

Eventually the din subsided a bit and the Xias could hear banging on
the side gate of the house.  Dr.  Xia went warily to the door of the
room and eased it open: the Kuomintang soldiers had gone.  Then he went
to the side gate of the house and asked who was there.  A voice
answered: "We are the people's army.  We have come to liberate you."
Dr.  Xia opened the gate and several men in baggy uniforms entered
swiftly.  In the darkness, my mother could see that they were wearing
white towels wrapped around their left sleeves like armbands and held
their guns at the ready, with fixed bayonets.

"Don't be afraid," they said.

"We won't harm you.  We are your army, the people's army."  They said
they wanted to check the house for Kuomintang soldiers.

It was not a request, though it was put politely.  The soldiers did not
turn the place upside down, nor did they ask for food or steal
anything.  After the search they left, bidding the family a courteous
farewell.

It was only when the soldiers entered the house that it sank in that
the Communists had really taken the city.  My mother was overjoyed This
time she did not feel let down by the Communist soldiers' dust covered
torn uniforms.

All the people who had been sheltering in the Xias' house were anxious
to get back to their houses to see if they had been damaged or looted.
One house had in fact been leveled, and a pregnant woman who had
remained there was killed.

Shortly after the neighbors left there was another knock on the side
gate.  My mother opened it: half a dozen terrified Kuomintang soldiers
stood there.  They were in a pitiable state and their eyes were gnawed
by fear.  They kowtowed to Dr.  Xia and my grandmother and begged for
civilian clothes.  The Xias felt sorry for them and gave them some old
clothes which they hurriedly put on over their uniforms and left.

At first light Yu-lin's wife opened the front gate.  Several corpses
were lying right outside.  She let out a terrified yell and ran back
into the house.  My mother heard her shriek and went outside to have a
look.  Corpses were lying all over the street, many of them with their
heads and limbs x5o "Daughter for Sale for lo Kilos of Rice' missing,
others with their intestines pouring out.  Some were just bloody
messes. Chunks of flesh and arms and legs were hanging from the
telegraph poles.  The open sewers were clogged with bloody water, human
flesh, and rubble.

The battle for Jinzhou had been herculean.  The final attack had lasted
thirty-one hours, and in many ways it was the turning point of the
civil war.  Twenty thousand Kuomintang soldiers were killed and over
80,000 captured.

No fewer than eighteen generals were taken prisoner, among them the
supreme commander of the Kuomintang forces in Jinzhou, General Fan
Han-jie, who had tried to escape disguised as a civilian.  As the
prisoners of war thronged the streets on their way to the temporary
camps, my mother saw a friend of hers with her Kuomintang officer
husband, both of them wrapped in blankets against the morning chill.

It was Communist policy not to execute anyone who laid down their arms,
and to treat all prisoners well.  This would help win over the ordinary
soldiers, most of whom came from poor peasant families.  The Communists
did not run prison camps.  They kept only middle- and high-ranking
officers, and dispersed the rest almost immediately.  They would hold
'speak bitterness' meetings for the soldiers, at which they were
encouraged to speak up about their hard lives as landless peasants. The
revolution, the Communists said, was all about giving them land. The
soldiers were given a choice: either they could go home, in which case
they would be given their fare, or they could stay with the Communists
to help wipe out the Kuomintang so that nobody would ever take their
land away again.  Most willingly stayed and joined the Communist army. 
Some, of course, could not physically reach their homes with a war
going on.  Mao had learned from ancient Chinese warfare that the most
effective way of conquering the people was to conquer their hearts and
minds.  The policy toward prisoners proved enormously successful. 
Particularly after

In Battle Jbr a New China 15 l Jinzhou, more and more Kuomintang
soldiers simply let themselves be captured.  Over 1.75 million
Kuomintang troops surrendered and crossed over to the Communists during
the civil war.  In the last year of the civil war, bat He casualties
accounted for less than 2o percent of all the troops the Kuomintang
lost.

One of the top commanders who had been caught had his daughter with
him; she was in an advanced stage of pregnancy.  He asked the Communist
commanding officer if he could stay in Jinzhou with her.  The Communist
officer said it was not convenient for a father to help his daughter
deliver a baby, and that he would send a 'woman comrade' to help her.
The Kuomintang officer thought he was only saying this to get him to
move on.  Later on he learned that his daughter had been very well
treated, and the 'woman comrade' turned out to be the wife of the
Communist officer.  Policy toward prisoners was an intricate
combination of political calculation and humanitarian consideration,
and this was one of the crucial factors in the Communists' victory.
Their goal was not just to crush the opposing army but, if possible, to
bring about its disintegration.  The Kuomintang was defeated as much by
demoralization as by firepower.

The first priority after the battle was cleaning up, most of which was
done by Communist soldiers.  The locals were also keen to help, as they
wanted to get rid of the bodies and the debris around their homes as
quickly as possible.

For days, long convoys of carts loaded with corpses and lines of people
carrying baskets on their shoulders could be seen wending their way out
of the city.  As it became possible to move around again, my mother
found that many people she knew had been killed; some from direct hits,
others buried under rubble when their houses had collapsed.

The morning after the siege ended the Communists put up notices asking
the townspeople to resume normal life as quickly as possible.  Dr.  Xia
hung out his gaily decorated
shingle to show that his
medicine shop was open and was later told by the Communist
administration that he was the first doctor in the city to do so.  Most
shops reopened on 20 October even though the streets were not yet
cleared of bodies.  Two days later, schools reopened and offices began
working normal hours.

The most immediate problem was food.  The new government urged the
peasants to come and sell food in the city and encouraged them to do so
by setting prices at twice what they were in the countryside.  The
price of sorghum fell rapidly, from 100 million Kuomintang dollars for
a pound to 2,200 dollars.  An ordinary worker could soon buy four
pounds of sorghum with what he could earn in a day.  Fear of starvation
abated.  The Communists issued relief grain, salt, and coal to the
destitute.  The Kuomintang had never done anything like this, and
people were hugely impressed.

Another thing that captured the goodwill of the locals was the
discipline of the Communist soldiers.  Not only was there no looting or
rape, but many went out of their way to demonstrate exemplary behavior.
This was in sharp contrast with the Kuomintang troops.

The city remained in a state of high alert.  American planes flew over
threateningly.  On 23 October sizable Kuomintang forces tried
unsuccessfully to retake Jinzhou with a pincer movement from Huludao
and the northeast.  With the loss of Jinzhou, the huge armies around
Mukden and Changchun quickly collapsed or surrendered, and by 2
November the whole of Manchuria was in Communist hands.

The Communists proved extremely efficient at restoring order and
getting the economy going again.  Banks in Jinzhou reopened on 3
December, and the electricity supply resumed the next day.  On 29
December a notice went up announcing a new street administration
system, with residents' committees in place of the old neighborhood
committees.  These were to be a key institution in the Communist system
of administration and control.  The next day

In Battle ~r a New China I 5 3 running water resumed and on the 3ist
the railwa~ reopened.

The Communists even managed to put an end to inflation, setting a
favorable exchange rate for converting the worthless Kuomintang money
into Communist "Great Wall' currency.

From the moment the Communist forces arrived, my mother had been
longing to throw herself into working for the revolution.  She felt
herself to be very much a part of the Communist cause.  After some days
of waiting impatiently, she was approached by a Party representative
who gave her an appointment to see the man in charge of youth work in
Jinzhou, a Comrade Wang Yu.

6. "Talking about Love' ^ Revolutionary Marriage

(1948-1949)

My mother set off to see Comrade Wang one morning on a mild autumn day,
the best time of year in Jinzhou.  The summer heat had gone and the air
had begun to grow cooler, but it was still warm enough to wear summer
clothes.  The wind and dust which plague the town for much of the year
were deliciously absent.

She was wearing a traditional loose pale blue gown and a white silk
scarf.  Her hair had just been cut short in keeping with the new
revolutionary fashion.  As she walked into the courtyard of the new
provincial government headquarters she saw a man standing under a tree
with his back to her, brushing his teeth at the edge of a flowerbed.
She waited for him to finish, and when he lifted his head she saw that
he was in his late twenties, with a very dark face and big, wistful
eyes.  Under his baggy uniform she could see that he was thin, and she
thought he looked a lit He shorter than herself.  There was something
dreamy about him.  My mother thought he looked like a poet.

"Comrade Wang, I am Xia De-hong from the students' association," she
said.

"I am here to report on our work."

"Wang' was the nora de guerre of the man who was to

A Revolutionary Marriage I 55 become my father.  He had entered Jinzhou
with the Communist forces a few days earlier.  Since late 1945 he had
been a commander with the guerrillas in the area.  He was now head of
the Secretariat and a member of the Communist Party Committee governing
Jinzhou, and was soon to be appointed head of the Public Affairs
Department of the city, which looked after education, the literacy
drive, health, the press, entertainment, sports, youth, and sounding
out public opinion.  It was an important post.

He was born in 1921 in Yibin in the southwestern province of Sichuan,
about 1,200 miles from Jinzhou.  Yibin, which then had a population of
about 30,000, lies at the spot where the Min River joins the Golden
Sand River to form the Yangtze, the longest river in China.  The area
around Yibin is one of the very fertile parts of Sichuan, which is
known as "Heaven's Granary," and the warm, misty climate in Yibin makes
it an ideal place for growing tea.  Much of the black tea consumed in
Britain today comes from there.

My father was the seventh of nine children.  His father had worked as
an apprentice for a textile manufacturer since the age of twelve.  When
he became an adult he and his brother, who worked in the same factory,
decided to start their own business.  Within a few years they were
prospering, and were able to buy a large house.

But their old boss was jealous of their success, and brought a lawsuit
against them, accusing them of stealing money from him to start their
business.  The case lasted seven years, and the brothers were forced to
spend all their assets trying to clear themselves.  Everyone connected
with the court extorted money from them, and the greed of the officials
was insatiable.  My grandfather was thrown into prison.  The only way
his brother could get him out was to get the ex-boss to drop the suit.
To do this he had to raise 1,000 pieces of silver.  This destroyed
them, and my great-uncle died soon afterward at the age of thirty-four
from worry and exhaustion.

My grandfather found himself looking after two families, with fifteen
dependents.  He started up his business again, and by the late 1920s
was beginning to do well.  But it was a time of widespread fighfng
among warlords, who all levied heavy taxes.  This, combined with the
effects of the Great Depression, made it an extremely difficult time to
run a textile factory.  In 1933 my grandfather died of overwork and
strain, at age forty-five.  The business was sold to pay off the debts,
and the family was scattered.  Some became soldiers, which was
considered pretty much a last resort; with all the fighting going on,
it was easy for a soldier to get killed.  Other brothers and cousins
found odd jobs and the gifts married as best they could.  One of my
father's cousins, who was fifteen years old and to whom he was very
attached, had to marry an opium addict several decades her senior. When
the sedan chair came to carry her away, my father ran after her, not
knowing if he would ever see her again.

My father loved books, and began to learn to read classical prose at
the age of three, which was quite exceptional.

The year after my grandfather died he had to abandon school.  He was
only thirteen and hated having to give up his studies.  He had to find
a job, so the following year, 1935, he left Yibin and went down the
Yangtze to Chongqing, a much bigger city.  He found a job as an
apprentice in a grocery store working twelve hours a day.  One of his
jobs was to carry his boss's enormous water pipe as he moved around the
city reclining on a bamboo chair carried on the shoulders of two men.
The sole purpose of this was for his boss to flaunt the fact that he
could afford a servant to carry his water pipe, which could easily have
been put in the chair.  My father received no pay, just a bed and two
meager meals a day.  He got no supper, and went to bed every night with
cramps from an empty stomach; he was obsessed by hunger.

His eldest sister was also living in Chongking.  She had married a
schoolteacher, and their mother had come to live with them after her
husband died.  One day my father was so hungry he went into their
kitchen and ate a cold sweet potato.  When his sister found out she
turned on him and yelled: "It's difficult enough for me to support our
mother.  I can't afford to feed a brother as well."  My father was so
hurt he ran out of the house and never returned.

He asked his boss to give him supper.  His boss not only refused, but
started to abuse him.  In anger, my father left and went back to Yibin
and lived doing odd jobs as an apprentice in one store after another.
He encountered suffering not only in his own life, but all around him.
Every day as he walked to work he passed an old man selling baked
rolls.  The old man, who shuffled along with great difficulty, bent
double, was blind.  To attract the attention of passersby, he sang a
heart-rending tune.  Every time my father heard the song he said to
himself that the sociew must change.

He began to cast around for some way out.  He had always remembered the
first time he heard the word 'communism': it was when he was seven
years old, in 1928.  He was playing near his home when he saw that a
big crowd had gathered at a crossroads nearby.  He squeezed his way to
the front: there he saw a young man sitting cross-legged on the ground.
His hands were tied behind his back; standing over him was a stout man
with an enormous broadsword.  The young man, strangely, was allowed to
talk for a time about his ideals and about something called communism.
Then the executioner brought the sword down on the back of his neck. My
father screamed and covered his eyes.  He was shaken to the core, but
he was also hugely impressed by the man's courage and calmness in the
face of death.

By the second half of the 1930s, even in the remote backwater of Yibin,
the Communists were beginning to organize a sizable underground.  Their
main plank was resisting the Japanese.  Chiang Kai-shek had adopted a
policy of nonresistance in the face of the Japanese seizure
of Manchuria and increasing encroachments on China
proper and had concentrated on trying to annihilate the Communists. The
Communists launched a slogan, "Chinese must not fight Chinese," and put
pressure on Chiang Kai-shek to focus on fighting the Japanese.  In
December 1936 Chiang was kidnapped by two of his own generals, one of
them the Young Marshal, Chang Hsuehliang, from Manchuria.  He was saved
partly by the Communists, who helped get him released in return for his
agreement to form a united front against Japan.  Chiang Kai-shek had to
consent, albeit half-heartedly, since he knew this would allow the
Communists to survive and develop.

"The Japanese are a disease of the skin," he said, 'the Communists are
a disease of the heart."  Though the Communists and the Kuomintang were
supposed to be allies, the Communists still had to work underground in
most areas.

In July 1937 the Japanese began their all-out invasion of China proper.
My father, like many others, felt appalled and desperate about what was
happening to his country.

At about this time he started working in a bookshop which sold
left-wing publications.  He devoured book after book at night in the
shop, where he functioned as a kind of night watchman.

He supplemented his earnings from the bookshop with an evening job as
an 'explainer' in a cinema.  Many of the films were American silents.
His job was to stand beside the screen and explain what was going on,
as the films were neither dubbed nor subtitled.  He also joined an
antiJapanese theater group, and as he was a slender young man with
delicate features, he acted women's roles.

My father loved the theater group.  It was through the friends he made
there that he first entered into contact with the Communist
underground.  The Communist stance about fighting the Japanese and
about creating a just society fired his imagination and he joined the
Party in 1938, when he was seventeen.  It was a time when the

Kuomintang was being extremely vigilant about Communist activities in
Sichuan.  Nanjing, the capital, had fallen to the Japanese in December
1937, and Chiang Kai-shek subsequently moved his government to
Chongqing.  The move precipitated a flurry of police activity in
Sichuan, and my father's theater group was forcibly disbanded.  Some of
his friends were arrested.  Others had to flee.  My father felt
frustrated that he could not do anything for his country.

A few years before, Communist forces had passed through remote parts of
Sichuan on their 6,000-mile Long March, which ultimately took them to
the small town of Yan'an in the northwest.  People in the theater group
had talked a lot about Yan'an as a place of camaraderie, uncorrupt and
efficient- my father's dream.  At the beginning of 1940 he set out on
his own long march to Yan'an.  He first went to Chongqing, where one of
his brothers-in-law, who was an officer in Chiang Kai-shek's army,
wrote a letter to help him cross Kuomintang-occupied areas and get
through the blockade that Chiang Kai-shek had thrown up around Yan'an.
The journey took him almost four months.  By the time he arrived it was
April 1940.

Yan'an lay on the Yellow Earth Plateau, in a remote and barren part of
northwest China.  Dominated by a nine tiered pagoda, much of the town
consisted of rows of caves cut into the yellow cliffs.  My father was
to make these caves his home for over five years.  Mao Zedong and his
much-depleted forces had arrived there at different times in 1935 -
1936, at the end of the Long March, and subsequently made it the
capital of their republic.  Yan'an was surrounded by hostile territory;
its chief advantage was its remoteness, which made it difficult to
attack.

After a short spell at a Party school, my father applied to join one of
the Party's most prestigious institutions, the Academy of
Marxist-Leninist Studies.  The entrance exam was quite stiff, but he
took first place, as a result of his reading deep into the night in the
loft of the bookshop in Yibin.  His fellow candidates were amazed. Most
of them had come from the big cities like Shanghai, and had looked down
on him as a bit of a yokel.  My father became the youngest research
fellow in the Academy.

My father loved Yan'an.  He found the people there full of enthusiasm,
optimism, and purpose.  The Party leaders lived simply, like everyone
else, in striking contrast with Kuomintang officials.  Yan'an was no
democracy, but compared with where he had come from it seemed to be a
paradise of fairness.

In 1942 Mao started a "Rectfication' campaign, and invited criticisms
about the way things were being run in Yan'an.  A group of young
research fellows from the Academy, led by Wang Shi-wei and including my
father, put up wall posters criticizing their leaders and demanding
more freedom and the right to greater individual expression.  Their
action caused a storm, and Mao himself came to read the posters.

Mao did not like what he saw, and turned his campaign into a
witch-hunt.  Wang Shi-wei was accused of being a Trotskyite and a spy.
My father, as the youngest person in the Academy, was said by Ai Si-qi,
the chief exponent of Marxism in China and one of the leaders of the
Academy, to have 'committed a very naive mistake."  Earlier, Ai Si-qi
had often praised my father as a 'brilliant and sharp mind."

My father and his friends were subjected to relentless criticisms and
obliged to undertake self-criticisms at intensive meetings for months.
They were told that they had caused chaos in Yan'an and weakened the
Party's unity and discipline, which could damage the great cause of
saving China from the Japanese and from poverty and injustice.  Over
and over again, the Party leaders inculcated into them the absolute
necessity for complete submission to the Party, for the good of the
cause.

The Academy was shut down, and my father was sent to teach ancient
Chinese history to semi-literate peasants turned-officials at the
Central Party School.  But the ordeal had turned him into a convert.
Like so many other young

people, he had invested his life and faith in Yan'an.  He could not let
himself be easily disappointed.  He regarded his harsh treatment as not
only justified, but even a noble experience soul-cleansing for the
mission to save China.

He believed that the only way this could be done was through
disciplined, perhaps drastic, measures, including immense personal
sacrifice and the total subordination of the self.

There were less demanding activities as well.  He toured the
surrounding areas collecting folk poetry, and learned to be a graceful
and elegant dancer in Western-style ballroom dancing, which was very
popular in Yan'an many of the Communist leaders, including the future
prime minister, Zhou Enlai, enjoyed it.  At the foot of the dry, dusty
hills was the meandering, dark-yellow, silt-filled Yan River, one of
the scores which join the majestic Yellow River, and here my father
often went swimming; he loved to do the backstroke while looking up at
the simple solid pagoda.

Life in Yan'an was hard but exhilarating.  In 1942, Chiang Kai-shek
6ghtened his blockade.  Supplies of food, clothing, and other
necessities became drastically curtailed.

Mao called on everyone to take up hoes and spinning wheels and produce
essential goods themselves.  My father became an excellent spinner.

He stayed in Yan'an for the whole of the war.  In spite of the
blockade, the Communists strengthened their control over large areas,
particularly in northern China, behind the Japanese lines.  Mao had
calculated well: the Communists had won vital breathing space.  By the
end of the war they claimed some sort of control over ninety-five
million people, about 20 percent of the population, in eighteen 'base
areas."  Equally important, they gained experience at running a
government and an economy under tough conditions.  This stood them in
good stead: their organizational ability and their system of control
were always phenomenal.

On 9 August 1945, Soviet troops swept into northeast

China.  Two days later the Chinese Communists offered them military
cooperation against the Japanese, but they were turned down: Stalin was
supporting Chiang Kaishek.  That same day the Chinese Communists
started to order armed units and political advisers into Manchuria,
which everyone realized was going to be of critical importance.

A month after the Japanese surrender my father was ordered to leave
Yan'an and head for a place called Chaoyang in southwest Manchuria,
about 700 miles to the east, near the border with Inner Mongolia.

In November, after walking for two months, my father and his small
group reached Chaoyang.  Most of the territory was barren hills and
mountains, almost as poor as Yan'an.  The area had been part of
Manchukuo until three months before.  A small group of local Communists
had proclaimed its own 'government."  The Kuomintang underground then
did the same.  Communist troops came racing over from Jinzhou, about
fifty miles away, arrested the Kuomintang governor, and executed him
for 'conspiring to overthrow the Communist government."

My father's group took over, with the authority of Yan'an, and within a
month a proper administration began to function for the whole area of
Chaoyang, which had a population of about 100,000.  My father became
its deputy chief.  One of the first acts of the new government was to
put up posters announcing its policies: the release of all prisoners;
the closure of all pawnshops pawned goods could be recovered free of
charge; brothels were to be closed and prostitutes given six months'
living allowance by their owners; all grain stores were to be opened
and the grain distributed to those most in need; all property belonging
to Japanese and collaborators was to be confiscated; and Chinese-owned
industry and commerce was to be protected.

These policies were enormously popular.  They benefited the poor, who
formed the vast majority of the population.  Chaoyang had never known
even moderately good government; it had been ransacked by different
armies in the warlord period, and then occupied and bled white by the
Japanese for over a decade.

A few weeks after my father had started his new job, Mao issued an
order to his forces to withdraw from all vulnerable cities and major
communication routes and to pull back into the countryside 'leaving the
high road alone and seizing the land on both sides' and 'surrounding
the cities from the countryside."  My father's unit withdrew from
Chaoyang into the mountains.  It was an area almost devoid of
vegetation, except for wild grass and the occasional hazelnut tree and
wild fruits.  The temperatures fell at night to around minus 30 F with
icy gales.  Anyone caught outside at night without cover froze to
death.  There was practically no food.  From the exhilaration of seeing
Japan's defeat and their own sudden expansion into large tracts of the
northeast, the Communists' apparent victory was seemingly turning to
ashes within weeks.  As my father and his men hunkered down in caves
and poor peasant huts, they were in a somber mood.

The Communists and the Kuomintang were both maneuvering for advantage
in preparation for a resumption of full-scale civil war.  Chiang
Kai-shek had moved his capital back to Nanjing, and with American help,
had transported large numbers of troops to North China, issuing secret
orders for them to occupy all strategic places as fast as possible. The
Americans sent a leading general, George Marshall, to China to try to
persuade Chiang to form a coalition government with the Communists as
junior partners.  A truce was signed on 10 January 1946, to go into
effect on 13 January.  On the 14th the Kuomintang entered Chaoyang and
immediately started setting up a large armed police force and an
intelligence network and arming local landlords' squads.  Altogether,
they put together a force of over 4,000 men to annihilate the
Communists in the area.

By February my father and his unit were on the run,

retreating deeper and deeper into more and more inhospitable terrain.
Most of the time they had to hide with the poorest peasants.  By April
there was nowhere left to run, and they had to break up into smaller
groups.  Guerrilla warfare was the only way to survive.  Eventually my
father set up his base at a place called Six Household Village, in
hilly country where the Xiaoling River starts, about sixty five miles
west of Jinzhou.

The guerrillas had very few arms; they had to obtain most of their guns
from the local police or 'borrow' them from landlord forces.  The other
main source was former members of the Manchukuo army and police, to
whom the Communists made a particular pitch because of their weapons
and fighting experience.  In my father's area, the main thrust of the
Communists' policy was to reduce the rent and interest on loans the
peasants had to pay to the landlords.  They also confiscated grain and
clothing from landlords and distributed them to the poor peasants.

At first progress was slow, but by July, when the sorghum had grown to
its full height ready for harvesting, and was high enough to conceal
them, the different guerrilla units were able to come together for a
meeting in Six Household Village, under a huge tree which stood guard
over the temple.  My father opened by referring to the Chinese Robin
Hood story, The Water Margin: "This is our "Hall of Justice."  We are
here to discuss how to "rid the people of evil and uphold justice on
behalf of Heaven."

At this point my father's guerrillas were fighting mainly westward, and
the areas they took included many villages inhabited by Mongolians.  In
November 1946, as winter closed in, the Kuomintang stepped up their
attacks.  One day my father was almost captured in an ambush.  After a
fierce firefight, he just managed to break out.  His clothes were torn
to shreds and his penis was dangling out of his trousers, to the
amusement of his comrades.

They rarely slept in the same place two nights running, and often had
to move several times in one night.  They could never take their
clothes off to sleep, and their life was an uninterrupted succession of
ambushes, encirclements, and breakouts.  There were a number of women
in the unit, and my father decided to move them and the wounded and
unfit to a more secure area to the south, near the Great Wall.  This
involved a long and hazardous journey through Kuomintang-held areas.
Any noise might be fatal, so my father ordered all babies to be left
behind with local peasants.  One woman could not bring herself to
abandon her child, and in the end my father told her she would have to
choose between leaving the baby behind or being court-martialed.  She
left the baby.

In the following months, my father's unit moved eastward toward Jinzhou
and the key railway line from Manchuria to China proper.  They fought
in the hills west of Jinzhou before the regular Communist army arrived.
The Kuomintang launched a number of unsuccessful 'annihilation
campaigns' against them.  The unit's actions began to have an impact.
My father, now twenty-five, was so well known that there was a price on
his head and "Wanted' notices up all over the Jinzhou area.  My mother
saw these notices, and began to hear a lot about him and his guerrillas
from her relatives in Kuomintang intelligence.

When my father's unit was forced to withdraw, Kuomintang forces
returned and took back from the peasants the food and clothing which
the Communists had confiscated from the landlords.  In many cases
peasants were tortured, and some were killed, particularly those who
had eaten the food which they had often done because they were starving
and could not now hand it back.

In SIX Household Village the man who had owned the most land, one Jin
Ting-quan, had also been the police chief, and had brutally raped many
local women.  He had run away with the Kuomintang and my father's unit
had presided over the meeting which opened his house and his grain
store.  When Jin came back with the Kuomintang the peasants were made
to grovel in front of him and return all the goods they had been given
by the Communists.

Those who had eaten the food were tortured and their homes smashed. One
man who refused to kowtow or return the food was slowly burned to
death.

In spring 1947 the tide began to turn, and in March my father's group
was able to retake the town of Chaoyang.

Soon the whole surrounding area was in their hands.  To celebrate their
victory, there was a feast followed by entertainment.  My father was
brilliant at inventing riddles out of people's names, which made him a
great hit with his comrades.

The Communists carried out a land reform, confiscating land which had
hitherto been owned by a small number of landlords and redistributing
it equally among the peasants.

In Six Household Village the peasants at first refused to take Jin
Ting-quan's land, even though he had now been arrested.  Although he
was under guard, they bowed and scraped to him.  My father visited many
peasant families, and gradually learned the horrible truth about him.
The Chaoyang government sentenced Jin to death by shooting, but the
family of the man who had been burned to death, with the support of the
families of other victims, determined to kill him the same way.  As the
flames began to lick around his body Jin clenched his teeth, and did
not utter even a moan until the moment the fire surrounded his heart.
The Communist officials sent to carry out the execution did not prevent
the villagers (from doing this.

Although the Communists were opposed to torture in theory and on
principle, officials were told that they should not intervene if the
peasants wished to vent their anger in passionate acts of revenge.

People such as Jin were not just wealthy owners of land, but had
wielded absolute and arbitrary power, which they indulged willfully,
over the lives of the local population.

They were called e-ba ('ferocious despots').

In some areas the killing extended to ordinary landlords, who were
called 'stones' obstacles to the revolution.

Policy toward the 'stones' was: "When in doubt, kill."  My father
thought this was wrong and told his subordinates, and the people at
public meetings, that only those who unquestionably had blood on their
hands should be sentenced to death.  In his reports to his superiors he
repeatedly said that the Party should be careful with human lives, and
that excessive executions would only harm the revolution.  It was
partly because many people like my father spoke up that in February
1948 the Communist leadership issued urgent instructions to stop
violent excesses.

All the time, the main forces of the Communist army were coming nearer.
In early 1948 my father's guerrillas joined up with the regular army.
He was put in charge of an intelligence-gathering system covering the
JinzhouHuludao area; his job was to track the deployment of Kuomintang
forces and monitor their food situation.  Much of his information came
from agents inside the Kuomintang, including Yu-wu.  From these reports
he heard of my mother for the first time.

The thin, dreamy-looking man my mother saw brushing his teeth in the
courtyard that October morning was known among his fellow guerrillas
for his fastidiousness.  He brushed his teeth every day, which was a
novelty to the other guerrillas and to the peasants in the villages he
had fought through.  Unlike everyone else, who simply blew their noses
onto the ground, he used a handkerchief, which he washed whenever he
could.  He never dipped his face towel in the public washbasin like the
other soldiers, as eye diseases were widespread.  He was also known as
scholarly and bookish and always carried some volumes of classical
poetry with him, even in battle.

When she had first seen the "Wanted' posters and heard about this
dangerous 'bandit' from her relatives, my mother could tell that they
admired as well as feared him.  Now she was not a bit disappointed that
the legendary guerrilla did not look at all warrior like

My father also knew of my mother's courage and, most unusual of all,
the fact that she, a seventeen-year-old girl, was giving orders to men.
An admirable and emancipated woman, he had thought, although he had
also imagined her as a fierce dragon.  To his delight he found her
pretty and feminine, even rather coquettish.  She was both soft spoken
and persuasive and also, something rare in China, precise.  This was an
extremely important quality for him, as he hated the traditional
florid, irresponsible, and vague way of talking.

She noticed that he laughed a lot, and that he had shiny white teeth,
unlike most other guerrillas, whose teeth were often brown and rotting.
She was also attracted by his conversation.  He struck her as learned
and knowledgeable definitely not the sort of man who would mix up
Flaubert and Maupassant.

When my mother told him she was there to report on the work of her
students' union, he asked her what books the students were reading.  My
mother gave him a list and asked if he would come and give them some
lectures on Marxist philosophy and history.  He agreed, and asked her
how many people there were at her school.  She gave him an exact figure
at once.  Then he asked her what proportion of them backed the
Communists; again she immediately gave him a careful estimate.

A few days later he turned up to start his course of lectures.  He also
took the students through Mao's works and explained what some of Mao's
basic theories were.  He was an excellent speaker, and the girls,
including my mother, were bowled over.

One day, he told the students that the Party was organizing a trip to
Harbin, the Communists' temporary capital in the north of Manchuria.
Harbin was largely built by Russians and was known as 'the Paris of the
East' because of its broad boulevards, ornate buildings, smart shops,
and European-style cafes.  The trip was presented as a sight seeing
tour, but the real reason for it was that the Party

was worried that the Kuomintang was going to try to retake Jinzhou, and
they wanted to get the pro-Communist teachers and students, as well as
the professional elite like doctors, out in case the city was
reoccupied but they did not want to set off alarm bells by saying so. 
My mother and a number of her friends were among the 170 people chosen
to go.

In late November my mother set off by train for the north in a state of
high excitement.  It was in snow-covered Harbin, with its romantic old
buildings and its Russian mood of lingering pensiveness and poetry,
that my parents fell in love.  My father wrote some beautiful poems for
my mother there.  Not only were they in very elegant classical style,
which was a considerable accomplishment, but she discovered that he was
a good calligrapher, which raised him even higher in her esteem.

On New Year's Eve he invited my mother and a girlfriend of hers to his
quarters.  He was living in an old Russian hotel, which was like
something out of a fairy tale, with a brightly colored roof, ornate
gables, and delicate plaster work around the windows and on the
veranda.

When my mother came in, she saw a bottle sitting on a rococo table; it
had foreign lettering on it champagne.

My father had never actually drunk champagne before; he had only read
about it in foreign books.

By this time it was well known among my mother's fellow students that
the two were in love.  My mother, being the student leader, often went
to give long reports to my father, and it was noticed that she did not
come back until the small hours.  My father had several other admirers,
including the friend who was with my mother that night, but she could
see from how he looked at my mother, his teasing remarks and the way
they seized every chance to be physically close to each other, that he
was in love with her.

When the friend left toward midnight, she knew my mother was going to
stay behind.  My father found a note under the empty champagne bottle:
"Alas!  I shall have no more reason to drink champagne!  I hope the
champagne bottle is always full for you!"

That night, my father asked my mother whether she was committed to
anyone else.  She told him about her previous relationships, and said
the only man she had really loved was her cousin Hu, but that he had
been executed by the Kuomintang.  Then, in line with the new Communist
moral code which, in a radical departure from the past, enjoined that
men and women should be equal, he told her about his previous
relationships.  He said he had been in love with a woman in Yibin, but
that that had ended when he left for Yan'an.  He had had a few
girlfriends in Yan'an, and in his guerrilla days, but the war had made
it impossible even to contemplate the idea of marriage.  One of his
former girlfriends was to marry Chen Boda, the head of my father's
section of the Academy in Yan'an, who later rose to enormous power as
Mao's secretary.

After hearing each other's frank accounts of their past lives, my
father said he was going to write to the Jinzhou City Party Committee
asking for permission to 'talk about love' (tan-lian-ai) with my
mother, with a view to marriage.

This was the obligatory procedure.  My mother supposed it was a bit
like asking permission from the head of the family, and in fact that is
exactly what it was: the Communist Party was the new patriarch.  That
night, after their talk, my mother received her first present from my
father, a romantic Russian novel called It's Only Love.

The next day my mother wrote home saying she had met a man she liked
very much.  The immediate reaction of her mother and Dr.  Xia was not
enthusiasm but concern, because my father was an official, and
officials had always had a bad name among ordinary Chinese.  Apart from
their other vices, their arbitrary power meant they were thought
unlikely to treat women decently.  My grandmother's immediate
assumption was that my father was married already and wanted my mother
as a concubine.  After all, he was well beyond the marrying age for men
in Manchuria.

After about a month it was judged safe for the Harbin group to return
to Jinzhou.  The Party told my father that he had permission to 'talk
about love' with my mother.

Two other men had also applied, but their applications came too late.
One of them was Liang, who had been her controller in the underground.
In his disappointment he asked to be transferred away from Jinzhou.
Neither he nor the other man had breathed a word of their intentions to
my mother.

My father got back to be told he had been appointed head of the Public
Affairs Department ofJinzhou.  A few days later my mother took him home
to introduce him to her family.  The moment he came in the door my
grandmother turned her back on him, and when he tried to greet her she
refused to answer.  My father was dark and terribly thin the result of
the hardships he had been through in the guerrilla days, and my
grandmother was convinced he was well over forty, and therefore that it
was impossible he had not been married before.  Dr.  Xia treated him
politely, if formally.

My father did not stay long.  When he left, my grandmother was in
floods of tears.  No official could be any good, she cried.  But Dr.
Xia already realized, through meeting my father and from my mother's
explanations, that the Communists exercised such tight control over
their people that an official like my father would not be able to
cheat.  My grandmother was only half reassured: "But he is from
Sichuan.  How can the Communists find out when he comes from so far
away?"

She kept up her barrage of doubts and criticism, but the rest of the
family took to my father.  Dr.  Xia got on very well with him, and they
would talk together for hours.

Yu-lin and his wife also liked him very much.  Yu-lin's wife had come
from a very poor family.  Her mother had been forced into an unhappy
marriage after her grandfather had staked her in a card game and lost.
Her brother had been caught in a roundup by the Japanese and had had to
do
three years of forced labor, which destroyed
his body.

From the day she married Yu-lin, she had to get up at three o'clock
every morning to start preparing the various different meals demanded
by the complicated Manchu tradition.  My grandmother was running the
house and, although they were in theory members of the same generation,
Yu-lin's wife felt that she was the inferior because she and her
husband were dependent on the Xias.  My father was the first person to
make a point of treating her as an equal, which in China was a
considerable departure from the past, and several times he gave the
couple film tickets, which for them was a big treat.  He was the first
official they had ever met who did not put on airs, and Yu-lin's wife
certainly felt that the Communists were a big improvement.

Less than two months after returning from Harbin my mother and father
filed their application.  Marriage had traditionally been a contract
between families, and there had never been civil registration or a
marriage certificate.

Now, for those who had 'joined the revolution," the Party functioned as
the family head.  Its criteria were '28-7-regiment-l' which meant that
the man had to be at least twenty-eight years old, a Party member for
at least seven years, and with a rank equivalent to that of a
regimental commander; the '1' referred to the only qualification the
woman had to meet, to have worked for the Party for a minimum of one
year.  My father was twenty-eight according to the Chinese way of
counting age (one year old at birth), he had been a Party member for
over ten years, and he held a position equivalent to that of a deputy
division commander.  Although my mother was not a member of the Party,
her work for the underground was accepted as meeting the '1' criterion,
and since she had come back from Harbin she had been working full time
for an organization called the Women's Federation, which dealt with
women's affairs: it supervised the freeing of concubines and shutting
down brothels, mobilized women to make shoes for the army, organized
their education and their employment, informed them of their rights,
and helped ensure that women were not entering into marriages against
their wishes.

The Women's Federation was now my mother's 'work unit' (dan-weO, an
institution wholly under the control of the Party, to which everyone in
the urban areas had to belong and which regulated virtually every
aspect of an employee's life like in an army.  My mother was supposed
to live on the premises of the Federation, and had to obtain its
permission to marry.  The Federation left it up to my father's work
unit, as he was a higher official.  The Jinzhou City Party Committee
speedily gave its written permission, but because of my father's
position, clearance also had to come from the Party Committee for the
province of West Liaoning.  Assuming there would be no problem, my
parents set the wedding day for 4 May, my mother's eighteenth
birthday.

On that day my mother wrapped up her bedroll and her clothes and got
ready to move into my father's quarters.

She wore her favorite pale blue gown and a white silk scarf.

My grandmother was appalled.  It was unheard of for a bride to walk to
the bridegroom's house.  The man had to get a sedan chair to carry her
over.  For a woman to walk was a sign that she was worthless and that
the man did not really want her.

"Who cares about all that stuff now?"  said my mother as she tied up
her bedroll.  But my grandmother was more dismayed at the thought that
her daughter was not going to have a magnificent traditional wedding.
From the moment a baby girl was born, her mother would start putting
things aside for her dowry.  Following the custom, my mother's
trousseau contained a dozen satin-covered quilts and pillows with
embroidered mandarin ducks, as well as curtains and a decorated pelmet
for a four-poster bed.  But my mother regarded a traditional ceremony
as old-fashioned and redundant.  Both she and my father wanted to get
rid of rituals like that, which they felt had nothing to do with their
feelings.  Love was the only thing that mattered to these two
revolutionaries.

My mother walked, carrying her bedroll, to my father's quarters.  Like
all officials, he was living in the building where he worked, the City
Party Committee; the employees were housed in rows of bungalows with
sliding doors situated around a big courtyard.  As dusk fell, and they
were on the point of going to bed for the night, my mother was kneeling
down to take off my father's slippers when there was a knock on the
door.  A man was standing there, and he handed my father a message from
the Provincial Party Committee.  It said they could not get married
yet.  Only the tightening of my mother's lips showed how unhappy she
was.  She just bent her head, silently gathered up her bedroll, and
left with a simple "See you later."  There were no tears, no scene, not
even any visible anger.  The moment was etched indelibly into my
father's mind.  When I was a child he used to say: "Your mother was so
graceful."

Then, jokingly, "How times have changed!  You're not like your mother!
You wouldn't do something like that kneel down to take off a man's
shoes!"

What had caused the delay was that the Provincial Committee was
suspicious of my mother because of her family connections.  They
questioned her in great detail about how her family had come to be
connected with Kuomintang intelligence.  They told her she must be
completely truthful.  It was like giving evidence in court.

She also had to explain how each of the Kuomintang officers had sought
her hand, and why she was friends with so many Kuomintang Youth League
members.  She pointed out that her friends were the most anti-Japanese
and the most socially conscious people; and that when the

Kuomintang had come to Jinzhou in 1945, they had seen it as the
government of China.  She herself might well have joined, but at
fourteen she was too young.  In fact, most of her friends had soon
switched to the Communists.

The Party was divided: the City Committee took the view that my
mother's friends had acted out of pamofic motives; but some of the
provincial leaders treated them with open-ended suspicion.  My mother
was asked to 'draw a line' between herself and her friends.

"Drawing a line' between people was a key mechanism the Communists
introduced to increase the gap between those who were 'in' and those
who were 'out."  Nothing, even personal relationships, was left to
chance, or allowed to be fluid.  If she wanted to get married, she had
to stop seeing her friends.

But the most painful thing for my mother was what was happening to
Hui-ge, the young Kuomintang colonel.  The moment the siege was over,
after her initial exhilaration that the Communists had won, her
strongest urge had been to see whether he was all right.  She ran all
the way through the blood-soaked streets to the Jis' mansion.  There
was nothing there no street, no houses, only a gigantic pile of rubble.
Hui-ge had disappeared.

In the spring, just as she was preparing to get married, she found out
that he was alive, a prisoner- and inJinzhou.

At the time of the siege he had managed to escape south and had ended
up at Tianjin; when the Communists took Tianjin in January 1949, he was
captured and brought back.

Hui-ge was not regarded as an ordinary prisoner of war.

Because of his family's influence in Jinzhou, he fell into the category
of' snakes in their old haunts," meaning established powerful local
figures.  They were especially dangerous for the Communists because
they commanded loyalty from the local population, and their
anti-Communist inclinations posed a threat to the new regime.

My mother felt confident that Hui-ge would be fairly treated after it
was known what he had done, and she immediately started to appeal on
his behalfi As was the procedure, she had to talk first to her
immediate boss in her unit, the Women's Federation, which forwarded the
appeal to a higher authority.  My mother did not know who had the final
say.  She went to Yu-wu, who knew about, and indeed had instructed, her
contact with Hui-ge, and asked him to vouch for the colonel.  Yu-wu
wrote a report describing what Hui-ge had done, but added that he had
perhaps acted out of love for my mother, and that he might not even
have known he was helping the Communists because he was blinded by
love.

My mother went to another underground leader who knew what the colonel
had done.  He too refused to say that Hui-ge had been helping the
Communists.  In fact he was not willing to mention the co loners role
in getting information out to the Communists at all, so that he could
take full credit for it himself.  My mother said that she and the
colonel had not been in love, but she could not produce any proof.  She
cited the veiled requests and promises that had passed between them,
but these were regarded only as evidence that the colonel was trying to
buy 'insurance," something about which the Party was particularly
chary.

All this was going on at the time that my mother and father were
preparing to get married, and it cast a dark shadow over their
relationship.  However, my father sympathized with my mother's
quandary, and thought Hui-ge should be treated fairly.  He did not let
the fact that my grandmother had favored the colonel as her son-in-law
influence his judgment.

In late May, permission finally arrived for the wedding to go ahead. My
mother was at a meeting of the Women's Federation when someone came in
and slipped a note into her hand.  The note was from the city Party
chief, Lin Xiao-xia, who was a nephew of the top general who had led
the Communist forces in Manchuria, Lin Biao.  It was in verse, and said
sun ply "The provincial authorities have given the okay.  You can't
possibly want to be stuck in a meeting.  Come quickly and get
married!"

My mother tried to look calm as she walked up and gave the note to the
woman presiding over the meeting, who nodded approval for her to leave.
She ran all the way to

A Revolutionary Mannage 17 7 my father's quarters, still wearing her
blue "Lenin suit," a uniform for government employees that had a
doublebreasted jacket tucked in at the waist and worn over bag~
trousers.  When she opened the door, she saw Lin Xiao-xia and the other
Party leaders and their bodyguards, who had just arrived.  My father
said a carriage had been sent for Dr.  Xia.  Lin asked: "What about
your mother-in-law?"  My father said nothing.

"That's not right," Lin said, and ordered a carriage to be sent for
her.  My mother felt very hurt, but attributed my father's action to
his loathing of my grandmother's Kuomintang intelligence connections.
Still, she thought, was that her mother's fault?  It did not occur to
her that my father's behavior might have been a reaction to the way her
mother had treated him.

There was no wedding ceremony of any kind, only a small gathering.  Dr.
Xia came up to congratulate the couple.  Everyone sat around for a
while eating fresh crabs which the City Party Committee had provided as
a special treat.  The Communists were trying to institute a frugal
approach to weddings, which had traditionally been the occasion for
huge expenditure, far out of proportion to what people could afford. It
was not at all unusual for families to bankrupt themselves to put on a
lavish wedding.

My parents had dates and peanuts, which had been served at weddings in
Yan'an, and dried fruit called long an which traditionally symbolizes a
happy union and sons.  After a short time, Dr.  Xia and most of the
guests left.  A group from the Women's Federation turned up late',
after their meeting was over.

Dr.  Xia and my grandmother had had no idea about the wedding, nor did
the first carriage driver tell them.  My grandmother only heard that
her daughter was about to be married when the second carriage came.  As
she hurried up the path and came into view through the window, the
women from the Federation started whispering to each other and then
scut fled out the back door.  My father left as well.  My mother was on
the verge of tears.  She knew the women from her group despised my
grandmother not only because of her Kuomintang connections but also
because she had been a concubine.  Far from being emancipated on these
issues, many Communist women from uneducated peasant backgrounds were
set in their traditional ways.  For them, no good gift would have
become a concubine even though the Communists had stipulated that a
concubine enjoyed the same status as a wife, and could dissolve the
'marriage' unilaterally.  These women from the Federation were the very
ones supposed to be implementing the Party's policies of
emancipation.

My mother covered up, telling her mother that her bridegroom had had to
go back to work: "It is not the Communist custom to give people leave
for a wedding.  In fact, I am about to go back to work myself."  My
grandmother thought that the offhand way in which the Communists
treated a big thing like a wedding was absolutely extraordinary, but
they had broken so many rules relating to traditional values, maybe
this was just one more.

At the time one of my mother's jobs was teaching reading and writing to
the women in the textile factory where she had worked under the
Japanese, and informing them about women's equality with men.  The
factory was still privately owned, and one of the foremen was still
beating women employees whenever he felt like it.  My mother was
instrumental in getting him sacked, and helped the women workers elect
their own forewoman.  But any credit she might have ?eceived for
achieving this was obscured by the Federation's dissatisfaction about
another matter.

One major task of the Women's Federation was to make cotton shoes for
the army.  My mother did not know how to make shoes, so she got her
mother and aunts to do it.

They had been brought up making elaborate embroidered shoes, and my
mother proudly presented the Women's Federation with a large number of
beautifully made shoes, far exceeding her quota.  To her surprise,
instead of being praised for her ingenuity, she was scolded like a
child.  The peasant women in the Federation could not conceive that
there could be a woman on the face of the earth who did not know how to
make shoes.  It was like saying someone did not know how to eat.  She
was criticized at the Federation meetings for her 'bourgeois
decadence."

My mother did not get on with some of her bosses in the Women's
Federation.  They were older, and conservative, peasant women who had
slogged for years with the guerrillas, and they resented pretty,
educated city girls like my mother who immediately attracted the
Communist men.

My mother had applied to join the Party, but they said that she was
unworthy.

Every time she went home she found herself being criticized.  She was
accused of being 'too attached to her family," which was condemned as a
'bourgeois habit," and had to see less and less of her own mother.

At the time there was an unwritten rule that no revolutionary could
spend the night away from his or her office except on Saturdays.  My
mother's assigned sleeping place was in the Women's Federation, which
was separated from my father's quarters by a low mud wall.  At night
she would clamber over the wall and cross a small garden to my father's
room, returning to her own room before dawn.

She was soon found out, and she and my father were criticized at Party
meetings.  The Communists had embarked on a radical reorganization not
just of institutions, but of people's lives, especially the lives of
those who had 'joined the revolution."  The idea was that everything
personal was political; in fact, henceforth nothing was supposed to be
regarded as 'personal' or private.  Pettiness was validated by being
labeled 'political," and meetings became the forum by which the
Communists channeled all sorts of personal animosities.

My father had to make a verbal self-criticism, and my mother a written
one.  She was said to have 'put love first," when revolution should
have had priority.  She felt very wronged.  What harm could it do the
revolution if she spent the night with her husband?  She could
understand the rationale for such a rule in the guerrilla days, but not
now.

She did not want to write a self-criticism, and told my father so.  To
her dismay he admonished her, saying: "The revolution is not won.  The
war is still going on.  We have broken the rules, and we should admit
mistakes.  A revolution needs steel-like discipline.  You have to obey
the Party even if you do not understand it or agree with it."

Soon after this disaster struck out of the blue.  A poet called Bian,
who had been in the delegation to Harbin and who had become a close
friend of my mother, tried to kill himself.  Bian was a follower of the
"New Moon' school of poetry, a leading exponent of which was Hu Shi,
who became Kuomintang ambassador to the.  United States.  It
concentrated on aesthetics and form and was~ particularly influenced by
Keats.  Bian had joined the Communists during the war, but then found
that his poetry was deemed not to be in harmony with the revolution,
which wanted propaganda, not self-expression.  He accepted this with
part of his mind, but he was also very torn and depressed.

He began to feel that he would never be able to write again, and yet,
he said, he could not live without his poetry.

His attempted suicide shocked the Party.  It was bad for its image for
people to think that anyone might be so disillusioned with Liberation
that they would try to kill themselves.  Bian was working in Jinzhou as
a teacher at the school for Party officials, many of whom were
illiterate.

The Party organization at the school conducted an investigation and
leapt to the conclusion that Bian had tried to kill himself because of
unrequited love for my mother.

In its criticism meetings the Women's Federation suggested that my
mother had led Bian on and then ditched him for a bigger prize, my
father.  My mother was furious, and demanded to see the evidence for
the accusation.  Of course, none was ever produced.

In this case, my father stood by my mother.  He knew that on the trip
to Harbin, when my mother was supposed

to have been having trysts with Bian, she had been in love with him,
not the poet.  He had seen Bian reading his poems to my mother and knew
that my mother admired him, and did not think there was anything wrong
with it.

But neither he nor my mother could stop the flood of gossip.  The women
in the Federation were particularly virulent.

At the height of this whispering campaign my mother heard that her
appeal for Hui-ge had been turned down.

She was beside herself with anguish.  She had made a promise to Hui-ge,
and now she felt that she had somehow misled him.  She had been
visiting him regularly in prison, bringing him news of her efforts to
get his case reviewed, and she had felt it was inconceivable that the
Communists would not spare him.  She had been genuinely optimistic and
had tried to cheer him up.  But this time when he saw her face,
red-eyed and distorted from the effort of hiding her despair, he knew
there was no hope.  They wept together, sitting in full view of the
guards with a table between them on which they had to place their
hands.

Hui-ge took my mother's hands in his; she did not pull back.

My father was informed of my mother's visits to the prison.  At first
he said nothing.  He sympathized with her predicament.  But gradually
he became angry.  The scandal about Bian's attempted suicide was at its
height, and now it was alleged that his wife had had a relationship
with a Kuomintang colonel and they were still supposed to be on their
honeymoon!  He was furious, but his personal feelings were not the
decisive factor in his acceptance of the Party's attitude toward the
colonel.  He told my mother that if the Kuomintang came back people
like Hui-ge would be the first to use their authority to help restore
it to power.  The Communists, he said, could not afford that risk: "Our
revolution is a matter of life and death."  When my mother tried to
tell him how Hui-ge had helped the Communists he responded that her
visits to the prison had
done Hui-ge no good,
particularly their holding hands.

Since the time of Confucius, men and women had to be married, or at
least lovers, to touch in public, and even under these circumstances it
was extremely rare.  The fact that my mother and Hui-ge had been seen
holding hands was taken as proof that they had been in love, and that
Hui-ge's service to the Communists had not been motivated by 'correct'
reasons.  My mother found it hard to disagree with him, but this did
not make her feel any less desolate.

Her sense of being caught up in impossible dilemmas was heightened by
what was happening to several of her relatives and many people close to
her.  When the Communists arrived, they had announced that anybody who
had worked for Kuomintang intelligence had to report to them at once.
Her uncle Yu-lin had never worked in intelligence, but he had an
intelligence card, and felt he should report to the new authorities.
His wife and my grandmother tried to dissuade him, but he thought it
best to tell the truth.

He was in a difficult situation.  If he had not turned himself in and
the Communists had discovered the facts about him, which was highly
likely, given their formidable organization, he would have been in dire
trouble.  But by coming forward, he himself had given them grounds to
suspect him.

The Party's verdict was: "Has a political blemish in his past.  No
punishment, but can only be employed under control."  This verdict,
like almost all others, was not delivered by a court, but by a Party
body.  There was no clear definition of what it meant, but as a result
of it, for three decades Yu-lin's life would depend on the political
climate and on his Party bosses.  In those days Jinzhou had a
relatively relaxed City Party Committee, and he was allowed to go on
helping Dr.  Xia in the shop.

My grandmother's brother-in-law, "Loyalty' Pei-o, was exiled to the
country to do manual labor.  Because he had no blood on his hands, he
was given a sentence called

'under surveillance."  Instead of being imprisoned, this meant being
guarded (just as effectively) in society.  His family chose to go to
the country with him, but before they could leave, "Loyalty' had to
enter a hospital.  He had contracted venereal disease.  The Communists
had launched a major campaign to wipe out VD, and anyone who had it was
obliged to undergo treatment.

His work 'under surveillance' lasted three years.  It was rather like
assigned labor under parole.  People under surveillance enjoyed a
measure of freedom, but they had to report to the police at regular
intervals with a detailed account of everything they had done, or even
thought, since their last visit, and they were openly watched by the
police.

When they finished their term of formal surveillance, they would join
people like Yu-lin in a looser category of 'quiet' surveillance.  One
common form of this was the 'sandwich' being kept under close watch by
two neighbors who had been specifically assigned this task, often
called 'two reds sandwiching a black."  Of course, other neighbors,
through the residents' committees, were also entitled and encouraged to
report and inform on the unreliable 'black."  The 'people's justice'
was watertight, and was a central instrument of rule because it
enlisted so many citizens in active collusion with the state.

Zhu-ge, the scholarly looking intelligence officer who had married Miss
Tanaka, my mother's Japanese teacher, was sentenced to forced labor for
life and exiled to a remote border area (along with many former
Kuomintang officials, he was released in an amnesty in 1959).  His wife
was sent back to Japan.  As in the Soviet Union, almost all of those
sentenced to detention did not go to prison but into labor camps, often
working in dangerous jobs or highly polluted areas.

Some important Kuomintang figures, including intelligence men, went
unpunished.  The academic supervisor at my mother's school had been
district secretary of the Kuomintang, but there was evidence that he
had helped to save the lives of many Communists and Communist
sympathizers, including my mother, so he was spared.

The headmistress and two teachers who had worked for intelligence
managed to hide, and eventually escaped to Taiwan.  So did Yao-han, the
political supervisor who had been responsible for my mother's arrest.

The Communists also spared big shots like the 'last emperor," Pu Yi,
and top generals because they were 'useful."  Mao's stated policy was:
"We kill small Chiang Kaiosheks.  We don't kill big Chiang Kai-she ks
Keeping people like Pu Yi alive, he reasoned, would 'be well received
abroad."  No one could complain openly about this policy, but it was a
cause of much discontent in private.

It was a time of great anxiety for my mother's family.

Her uncle Yu-lin and her aunt Lan, whose fate was hitched inexorably to
that of her husband, "Loyalty," were in a state of acute uncertainty
about their futures, and suffering ostracism.  But the Women's
Federation ordered my mother to write one self-criticism after another,
as her grief indicated she had 'a soft spot for the Kuomintang."

She was also sniped at for visiting a prisoner, Hui-ge, without asking
for permission from the Federation first.

Nobody had told her she was supposed to do this.  The Federation said
that they had not stopped her before because they made allowances for
someone who was 'new to the revolution'; they were waiting to see how
long it would take her to reach her own sense of discipline and ask the
Party for instructions.

"But what are the things for which I need to apply for instructions?"
she asked.

"Anything," was the answer.  The need to obtain authorization for an
unspecified 'anything' was to become a fundamental element in Chinese
Communist rule.  It also meant that people learned not to take any
action on their own initiative.

My mother became ostracized within the Federation, which was her whole
world.  There were whispers that she had been used by Hui-ge to help
him prepare for a comeback.

"What a mess she got herself into," exclaimed the women, 'all because
she was "loose."  Look at all these involvements with men!  And what
kind of men!"  My mother felt surrounded by accusing fingers, and that
the people who were supposed to be her comrades in a glorious new and
liberating movement were questioning her character and her commitment,
for which she had risked her life.

She was even criticized for having left the meeting of the Women's
Federation to go and get married a sin termed 'putting love first."  My
mother said that the city chief had asked her to go.  To this the
chairwoman retorted: "But it was up to you to show your correct
attitude by putting the meeting first."

Just eighteen, recently married, and full of hope for a new life, my
mother felt miserably confused and isolated.

She had always trusted her own strong sense of right and wrong, but
this now seemed to be in conflict with the views of her 'cause' and,
often, the judgment of her husband, whom she loved.  She began to doubt
herself for the first time.

She did not blame the Party, or the revolution.  Nor could she blame
the women in the Federation, because they were her comrades and seemed
to be the voice of the Party.  Her resentment turned against my father.
She felt that his loyalty was not primarily to her and that he always
seemed to side with his comrades against her.  She understood that it
might be difficult for him to express his support in public, but she
wanted it in private and she did not get it.  From the very beginning
of their marriage, there was a fundamental difference between my
parents.  My father's devotion to communism was absolute: he felt he
had to speak the same language in private, even to his wife, that he
did in public.  My mother was much more flexible;

her commitment was tempered by both reason and emotion.  She gave a
space to the private; my father did not.

My mother was finding Jinzhou unbearable.  She told my father she
wanted to leave, right away.  He agreed, in spite of the fact that he
was just about to receive a promotion.  He applied to the City Party
Committee for a transfer, giving as the reason that he wanted to go
back to his hometown, Yibin.  The Committee was surprised, as he had
just told them this was exactly what he did not want to do.  Throughout
Chinese history, it had been a rule that officials were stationed away
from their hometowns to avoid problems of nepotism.

In the summer of 1949 the Communists were advancing southward with
unstoppable momentum: they had captured Chiang Kai-shek's capital,
Nanjing, and seemed certain to reach Sichuan soon.  Their experience in
Manchuria had shown them that they badly needed administrators who were
local and loyal.

The Party endorsed my father's transfer.  Two months after their
marriage and less than one year after Liberation they were being driven
out of my mother's hometown by gossip and spite.  My mother's joy at
Liberation had turned to an anxious melancholy.  Under the Kuomintang
she had been able to discharge her tension in action and it had been
easy to feel she was doing the right thing, which gave her courage. Now
she just felt in the wrong all the time.  When she tried to talk it
over with my father he would tell her that becoming a Communist was an
agonizing process.  That was the way it had to be.

7. "Going through the Five Mountain Passes' My Mothefts Long March

(1949-1950)

Just before my parents left Jinzhou, my mother was granted provisional
membership in the Party, thanks to the deputy mayor who oversaw the
Women's Federation, who argued that she needed it because she was going
to a new place.

The decision meant she could become a full member in one year's time,
if she was deemed to have proved herself worthy.

My parents were to join a group of over a hundred people traveling to
the southwest, most of them to Sichuan.

The bulk of the group were men, Communist officials from the southwest.
The few women were Manchurians who had married Sichuanese.  For the
journey they were organized into units and given green army uniforms.
The civil war was still raging in their path.

On 27 July 1949 my grandmother, Dr.  Xia, and my mother's closest
friends, most of whom were under suspicion from the Communists, came to
the station to see them off.  As they stood on the platform saying
goodbye, my mother felt torn by contradictory feelings.  With one
part of her heart she felt
like a bird which was now going to burst out of its cage and fly to the
sky.  With the other part she wondered when or if- she would ever see
these people she loved, particularly her mother, again.  The journey
was fraught with danger, and Sichuan was still in the hands of the
Kuomintang.  It was also 1,000 miles away, inconceivably far, and she
had no idea if she would ever be able to get back to Jinzhou.  She felt
an overwhelming desire to cry, but she held back her tears because she
did not want to make her mother sadder than she already was.

As the platform slipped out of sight my father tried to comfort her. He
told her that she must be strong, and that as a young student 'joining
the revolution' she needed to 'go through the five mountain passes'
which meant adopting a completely new attitude to family, profession,
love, life-style, and manual labor, through embracing hardship and
trauma.  The Party's theory was that educated people like her needed to
stop being 'bourgeois' and become closer to the peasants, who formed
over 8o percent of the population.  My mother had heard these theories
a hundred times.  She accepted the need to reform oneself for a new
China; in fact she had just written a poem about meeting the challenge
of 'the storm of sand' in her future.  But she also wanted more
tenderness and personal understanding, and she resented the fact that
she did not get them from my father.

When the train reached Tianjin, about z5o miles to the southwest, they
had to stop because the line ended.  My father said he would like to
take her around the city.  Tianjin was a huge port where the United
States, Japan, and a number of European states had until recently had
'concessions," extraterritorial enclaves (General Xue had died in the
French concession in Tianjin, although my mother did not know this).
There were whole quarters built in different foreign styles, with
grandiose buildings: elegant turn-of-the-century French palaces; light
Italian pa lazzi

overblown, late rococo Austro-Hungarian townhouses.  It

My Mother's Long March ~ 89 was an extraordinary condensation of
display by eight different nations, all of whom had been trying to
impress one another and the Chinese.  Apart from the squat, heaD', gray
Japanese banks, familiar from Manchuria, and the green-roofed Russian
banks, with their delicate pink-and yellow walls, it was the first time
my mother had ever seen buildings like these.  My father had read a lot
of foreign literature, and the descriptions of European buildings had
always fascinated him.  This was the first time he had seen them with
his own eyes.  My mother could tell he was going to a lot of trouble to
try to fire her with his enthusiasm, but she was still down in the
dumps as they strolled along the streets, which were lined with heavily
scented Chinese scholar trees.  She was already missing her mother, and
she could not rid herself of her anger against my father for not saying
anything sympathetic, and for his stiffness, although she knew he was
trying, awkwardly, to help her out of her mood.

The broken railway line was only the beginning.  They had to continue
their journey on foot, and the route was peppered with local landlords'
forces, bandits, and units of Kuomintang soldiers who had been left
behind as the Communists advanced.  There were only three rifles in the
entire group, one of which my father had, but at each stage along the
route the local authorities sent a squad of soldiers as an escort,
usually with a couple of machine guns.

They had to walk long distances every day, often on rough paths,
carrying their bedrolls and other belongings on their backs.  Those who
had been in the guerrillas were used to this, but after one day the
soles of my mother's feet were covered with blisters.  There was no way
she could stop for a rest.  Her colleagues advised her to soak her feet
in hot water at the end of the day and to let the fluid out by piercing
the blisters with a needle and a hair.

This brought instant relief, but the next day it was laceratingly
painful when she had to start walking again.  Each morning she gritted
her teeth and struggled on.

19o "Going through the Five Mountain Passes'

Much of the way there were no roads.  The going was appalling,
especially when it rained: the earth became a mass of slippery mud, and
my mother fell down more times than she could count.  At the end of the
day she would be covered with mud.  When they reached their destination
for the night, she would collapse on the ground and just lie there,
unable to move.

One day they had to walk over thirty miles in heavy rain.

The temperature was well over 9o F, and my mother was soaked to the
skin with rain and sweat.  They had to climb a mountain not a
particularly high one, only about 3,000 feet, but my mother was
completely exhausted.  She felt her bedroll weighing on her like a huge
stone.  Her eyes were clogged with sweat pouring from her forehead.
When she opened her mouth to gasp for air, she felt she could not get
enough into her lungs to breathe.  Thousands of stars were dancing
before her eyes and she could hardly drag one foot in front of the
other.  When she got to the top she thought her misery was over, but
going downhill was almost as difficult.  Her calf muscles seemed to
have turned to jelly.  It was wild country, and the steep, narrow path
ran along the edge of a cliff, with a drop of hundreds of feet.  Her
legs were trembling and she felt sure she was going to fall into the
abyss.  Several times she had to cling to trees to keep from toppling
over the cliff.

After they had crossed the mountain there were several deep,
fast-flowing rivers in their path.  The water level rose to her waist
and she found it almost impossible to keep her footing.  In the middle
of one river she stumbled and felt she was about to be swept away when
a man leaned over and caught hold of her.  She almost broke down and
wept, particularly since at this very moment she spotted a friend of
hers whose husband was carrying her across the river.

Although the husband was a senior official, and had the right to use a
car, he had waived his privilege in order to walk with his wife.

My father was not carrying my mother.  He was being

My Mother's Long March 19i driven along in a jeep, with his bodyguard.
His rank entitled him to transportation either a jeep or a horse,
whichever was available.  My mother had often hoped that he would give
her a lift, or at least carry her bedroll in his jeep, but he never
offered.  The evening after she almost drowned in the river, she
decided to have it out with him.

She had had a terrible day.  What was more, she was vomiting all the
time.  Could he not let her travel in his jeep occasionally?  He said
he could not, because it would be taken as favoritism since my mother
was not entitled to the car.  He felt he had to fight against the
age-old Chinese tradition of nepotism.  Furthermore, my mother was
supposed to experience hardship.  When she mentioned that her friend
was being carried by her husband, my father replied that that was
completely different: the friend was a veteran Communist.  In the 193OS
she had commanded a goerrilla unit jointly with Kim II Sung, who later
became president of North Korea, fighting the Japanese under appalling
conditions in the northeast.  Among the long list of sufferings in her
revolutionary career was the loss of her first husband, who had been
executed on orders from Stalin.  My mother could not compare herself to
this woman, my father said.  She was only a young student.  If other
people thought she was being pampered she would be in trouble.

"It's for your own good," he added, reminding her that her application
for full Party membership was pending.

"You have a choice: you can either get into the car or get into the
Party, but not both."

He had a point.  The revolution was fundamentally a peasant revolution,
and the peasants had an unrelentingly harsh life.  They were
particularly sensitive about other people enjoying or seeking comfort.
Anyone who took part in the revolution was supposed to toughen
themselves to the point where they became inured to hardship.  My
father had done this at Yan'an and as a goerrilla.

My mother understood the theory, but that did not stop her thinking
about the fact that my father was giving her

192 "Going through the Five Mountain Passes' no sympathy while she was
sick and exhausted the whole time, trudging along, carrying her
bedroll, sweating, vomiting, her legs like lead.

One night she could not stand it anymore, and burst into tears for the
first time.  The group usually stayed overnight in places like empty
storerooms, or classrooms.  That night they were all sleeping in a
temple, packed close together on the ground.  My father was lying next
to her.

When she first started crying, she turned her face away from him and
buried it in her sleeve, trying to muffle her sobs.  My father woke up
at once and hurriedly clapped his hand over her mouth.  Through her
tears she heard him whispering into her ear: "Don't cry out loud!  If
people hear you, you will be critcized."  To be criticized was serious.
It meant her comrades would say she was not worthy of 'being in the
revolution," even a coward.  She felt him urgently pushing a
handkerchief into her hand so that she could stifle her sobs.

The next day my mother's unit head, the man who had saved her from
falling over in the river, took her aside and told her he had received
complaints about her crying.

People were saying she had behaved like 'a precious lady from the
exploiting classes."  He was not unsympathetic, but he had to reflect
what other people were saying.  It was disgraceful to cry after walking
a few steps, he said.  She was not behaving like a proper
revolutionary.  From then on, though she often felt like it, my mother
never cried once.

She slogged on.  The most dangerous area they had to go through was the
province of Shandong, which had fallen to the Communists only a couple
of months previously.  On one occasion they were walking through a deep
valley when bullets started pouring down on them from above.  My mother
took cover behind a rock.  The shooting went on for about ten minutes,
and when it died down they found that one of their group had been
killed trying to get around behind the assailants, who turned out to be
bandits.  Several others were injured.  They buffed the dead man by the
roadside.  My father and the other officials gave up their horses to
the injured.

After forty days of marching and more skirmishes they reached the city
of Nanjing, about 7o0 miles due south of Jinzhou, which had been the
capital of the Kuomintang government.  It is known as 'the Furnace of
China," and in mid-September it was still like an oven.  The group was
housed in a barracks.  The bamboo mattress on my mother's bed had a
dark human figure imprinted on it by the sweat of those who had slept
there before her.  The group had to do military training in the
sweltering heat, learning how to tie up a bedroll, puttees, and
knapsack on the double, and practicing quick marching carrying their
kits.  As part of the army, they had to observe strict discipline. They
wore khaki uniforms and rough cotton shirts and underwear.  Their
uniforms had to be buttoned right up to the neck and they were never
allowed to unbutton the collar.  My mother found it hard to breathe,
and like everyone she had a huge dark patch of sweat covering her back.
They also wore a double-thickness cotton cap, which had to fit tightly
around the head so that it did not show any hair.  This made my mother
perspire profusely, and the edge of her cap was permanently soaked in
sweat.

Occasionally they were allowed out, and the first thing she did was to
devour several ice lollipops.  Many of the people in the group had
never been in a big city, apart from their brief stop at Tianjin.  They
were tremendously excited by the ice lollipops, and bought some to take
back to their comrades in the barracks, wrapping them up carefully in
their white hand towels and putting them in their bags.  They were
amazed when they got back to find that all that was left was water.

At Nanjing they had to attend political lectures, some of which were
given by Deng Xiaoping, the future leader of China, and General Chen
Yi, the future foreign minister.

My mother and her colleagues sat on the lawn at the

Central University, in the shade, while the lecturers stood in the
blazing sun for two or three hours at a stretch.  In spite of the heat,
the lecturers mesmerized their audience.

One day my mother and her unit had to run several miles on the double,
fully laden, to the tomb of the founding father of the republic, Sun
Yat-sen.  When they returned, my mother felt an ache in her lower
abdomen.

There was a performance of the Peking Opera that night in another part
of the city, with one of China's most famous stars in the lead.  My
mother had inherited her mother's passion for the Peking Opera and was
looking forward eagerly to the performance.

That evening she walked with her comrades in file to the opera, which
was about five miles away.  My father went in his car.  On the way, my
mother felt more pain in her abdomen, and contemplated turning back,
but decided against it.  Halfway through the performance the pain
became unbearable.  She went over to where my father was sitting and
asked him to take her home in his car.  She did not tell him about the
pain.  He looked round to where his driver was sitting and saw him
glued to his seat, openmouthed.  He turned back to my mother and said:
"How can I interrupt his enjoyment just because my wife wants to
leave?"  My mother lost any desire to e~la'm that she was in agony and
turned abruptly away.

She walked all the way back to the barracks in excruciating pain.
Everything in front of her eyes was spinning.  She saw blackness with
sharp stars and felt as though she were plodding through cotton wool.
She could not see the road and lost track of how long she had been
walking.  It seemed like a lifetime.  When she got back, the barracks
was deserted.  Everybody except the guards had gone to the opera.  She
managed to drag herself to her bed, and by the light of a lamp she saw
that her trousers were soaked with blood.  She fainted as soon as her
head hit the bed.  She had lost her first child.  And there was nobody
near her.

A little later my father returned.  Being in a car, he got back before
most of the others.  He found my mother sprawled on the bed.  At first
he thought she was just exhausted, but then he saw the blood and
realized that she was unconscious.  He rushed off to find a doctor, who
thought she must have had a miscarriage.  Being an army doctor he had
no experience of what to do, so he telephoned a hospital in the city
and asked them to send an ambulance.  The hospital agreed but only on
condition that they were paid in silver dollars for the ambulance and
the emergency operation.  Even though he had no money of his own, my
father agreed without hesitation.  Being 'with the revolution' brought
automatic health insurance.

My mother had very nearly died.  She had to have a blood transfusion
and her womb scraped.  When she opened her eyes after the operation she
saw my father sit ling by her bedside.  The first thing she said was:
"I want a divorce."

My father apologized profusely.  He had had no idea she had been
pregnant nor, in fact had she.  She knew that she had missed her
period, but had thought it was probably the result of the unrelenting
exertion of the march.  My father said he had not known what a
miscarriage was.  He promised to be much more considerate in future,
and said over and over again he loved her and would reform.

While my mother was in a coma, he had washed her blood-soaked clothes,
which was very unusual for a Chinese man.  Eventually my mother agreed
not to ask for a divorce, but she said she wanted to go back to
Manchuria to resume her medical studies.  She told my father she could
never please the revolution, no matter how hard she tried; all she ever
got was criticism.

"I might as well leave," she said.

"You mustn't!"  my father said, anxiously.

"That will be interpreted as meaning you are afraid of hardship.

You will be regarded as a deserter and you will have no future.  Even
if the college accepted you, you would never be able to get a good job.
You would be discriminated against for the rest of your life."  My
mother was not yet aware that there was an unbreakable ban on opting
out of

196 "Going through the Fbve Mountain Passes' the system, because,
typically, it was unwritten.  But she caught the tone of extreme
urgency in his voice.  Once you were 'with the revolution' you could
never leave.

My mother was in the hospital when, on i October, she and her comrades
were alerted to expect a special broadcast, which would come over
loudspeakers that had been rigged up around the hospital.  They
gathered to listen to Mao proclaiming the founding of the People's
Republic from the top of the Gate of Heavenly Peace in Peking.  My
mother cried like a child.  The China she had dreamed of, fought for,
and hoped for was here at last, she thought, the country to which she
could devote herself heart and soul.  As she listened to Mao's voice
announcing that 'the Chinese people have stood up," she chided herself
for ever having wavered.  Her suffering was trivial compared to the
great cause of saving China.  She felt intensely proud and full of
nationalistic feeling, and pledged to herself that she would stick with
the revolution forever.  When Mao's short proclamation was over, she
and her comrades burst into cheers and threw their caps in the air a
gesture the Chinese Communists had learned from the Russians.

Then, after drying their tears, they had a little feast to celebrate.

A few days before the miscarriage, my parents had their first formal
photograph taken together.  It shows them both in army uniform, staring
pensively and rather wistfully into the camera.  The photograph was
taken to commemorate their entry into the former Kuomintang capital. My
mother immediately sent a print to her mother.

On 3 October my father's unit was moved out.  Communist forces were
nearing Sichuan.  My mother had to stay in the hospital another month,
and was then allowed some time to recuperate in a magnificent mansion
which had belonged to the main financier of the Kuomintang, Chiang
Kai-shek's brother-in-law H. H. Kung.  One day her unit was told they
were going to be extras in a documentary film about the liberation of
Nanjing.  They were given civilian clothes and dressed up as ordinary
citizens welcoming the Communists.  This reconstruction, which was not
inaccurate, was shown all over China as a 'documentary' - a common
practice.

My mother stayed on in Nanjing for nearly two more months.  Every now
and then she would get a telegram or a bunch of letters from my father.
He wrote every day and sent the letters whenever he could find a post
office that was working.  In every one, he told her how much he loved
her, promised to reform, and insisted that she must not go back to
Jinzhou and 'desert the revolution."

Toward the end of December, my mother was told there was a place for
her on a steamer with some other people who had been left behind
because of illness.  They were to assemble on the dock at nightfall
Kuomintang bombing made it too dangerous during daylight.  The quay was
shrouded in a chilly fog.  The few lights had been turned out as a
precaution against air raids.  A bitter north wind was sweeping snow
across the river.  My mother had to wait for hours on the dock,
desperately stamping her numb feet, which were clad only in the
standard-issue thin cotton shoes known as 'liberation shoes," some of
which had slogans such as "Beat Chiang Kai-shek' and "Safeguard Our
Land' painted on their soles.

The steamer carried them west along the Yangtze.  For about the first
200 miles, as far as the town of Anqing, it moved only at night, tying
up during the day among reeds on the north bank of the river to hide
from Kuomintang planes.  The ship carried a contingent of soldiers, who
set up machine guns on the deck, and a large amount of military
equipment and ammunition.  There were occasional skirmishes with
Kuomintang forces and landowners' gangs.  Once, as they were edging
into the reeds to anchor for the day, they came under heavy fire and
some Kuomintang troops tried to board the ship.  My mother and the
other women hid belowdecks while the guards fought them off.  The ship
had to sail off and anchor farther on.

When they reached the Yangtze Gorges, where Sichuan begins and the
river becomes dramatically narrower, they had to change into two
smaller boats which had come from Chongqing.  The military cargo and
some guards were transferred to one boat, while the rest of the group
took the second boat.

The Yangtze Gorges were known as 'the Gates of Hell."

One afternoon the bright winter sun suddenly disappeared.

My mother rushed on deck to see what had happened.  On both sides huge
perpendicular cliffs towered over the river, leaning toward the boat as
though they were about to crush it.  The cliffs were covered with thick
vegetation and were so high that they almost obscured the sky.  Every
cliff seemed steeper than the last, and they looked as though some
mighty sword had smashed down from heaven and cleaved its way through
them.

The small boat battled for days against the currents, whirlpools,
rapids, and submerged rocks, Sometimes the force of the current swept
it backwards, and it felt as though it was going to capsize at any
moment.  Often my mother thought they were going to be dashed into a
cliff, but each time the helmsman managed to steer away at the last
second.

The Communists had taken most of Sichuan only within the last month. It
was still infested with Kuomintang troops, who had been stranded there
when Chiang Kaishek had abandoned his resistance on the mainland and
fled to Taiwan.  The worst moment came when a band of these Kuomintang
soldiers shelled the first boat, which was carrying the ammunition. 
One round hit it square on.

My mother was standing on deck when it blew up about a hundred yards
ahead of her.  It seemed as though the whole fiver suddenly burst into
fire.  Flaming chunks of timber rushed toward my mother's boat, and it
looked as if there was no way they could avoid colliding with the
burning wreckage.  But just as a collision seemed inevitable, it
floated past, missing them by inches.  Nobody showed any signs of fear,
or elation.  They all seemed to have grown numb to death.  Most of the
guards on the first boat were killed.

My mother was entering a whole new world of climate and nature.  The
precipices along the gorges were covered with gigantic rattan creepers
which made the eerie atmosphere even more exotic.  Monkeys were jumping
from branch to branch in the luxuriant foliage.  The endless,
magnificent, precipitous mountains were a stunning novelty after the
flat plains around Jinzhou.

Sometimes the boat would moor at the foot of a narrow flight of black
stone stairs, which seemed to climb endlessly up the side of a mountain
with its peak hidden in the clouds.  Often there was a small town at
the top of the mountain.  Because of the permanent thick mist, the
inhabitants had to burn rapeseed-oil lamps even in the daytime.

It was chilly, with damp winds blowing off the mountains and the fiver.
To my mother, the local peasants seemed horribly dark, bony, and tiny,
with much sharper features and much bigger and rounder eyes than the
people she was used to.  They wore a kind of turban made of long white
cloth wound around their foreheads.  White being the color of mourning
in China, my mother at first thought they were wearing mourning.

By the middle of January they had reached Chongqing, which had been the
Kuomintang's capital during the war against Japan, where my mother had
to move to a smaller boat for the next stage to the town of Luzhou,
about a hundred miles farther upriver.  There she received a message
from my father that a sampan had been sent to meet her and that she
could come to Yibin right away.  This was the first she knew that he
had arrived at his destination alive.  By now her resentment against
him had evaporated.

It was four months since she had seen him, and she missed him.  She had
imagined the excitement he must have felt along the way at seeing so
many sites described by the ancient poets, and she felt a glow of
warmth in the sure zoo "Going through the Five Mountain Passes'
knowledge that he would have composed poems for her on the journey.

She was able to leave that same evening.  Next morning when she woke,
she could feel the warmth of the sun coming through the soft mist.  The
hills along the river were green and gentle, and she was able to lie
back and relax and listen to the water lapping against the prow of the
sampan.  She got to Yibin that afternoon, the eve of Chinese New Year.
Her first sight of file town was like an apparition a delicate image of
a city floating in the clouds.

As the boat approached the quay, she looked about for my father.
Eventually, through the mist, she could make out his hazy image: he was
standing in an unbuttoned army greatcoat, his bodyguard behind him. The
riverbank was wide and covered with sand and cobblestones.  She could
see the city climbing up to the top of the hill.  Some of the houses
were built on long, thin, wooden stilts and seemed to be swaying in the
wind as though they might collapse at any minute.

The boat tied up at a dock on the promontory at the tip of the city.  A
boatman laid down a plank of wood and my father's bodyguard came across
and took my mother's bedroll.  She bounced down the gangway, and my
father stretched out his arms to help her off.  It was not the proper
thing to embrace in public, though my mother could tell he was as
excited as she, and she felt very happy.

8. "Returnins Home Robed in Embroidered Silk' To Family and Bandits
(1949-1951)

All the way, my mother had been wondering what Yibin would be like.
Would there be electricity?  Would the mountains be as high as those
along the Yangtze?  Would there be theaters?  As she climbed up the
hill with my father, she was thrilled to see she had come to a
beautiful place.  Yibin stands on a hill overlooking a promontory at
the confluence of two rivers, one clear, the other muddy.

She could see electric lights shining in the rows of cottages.

Their walls were made of mud and bamboo, and to her eyes the thin,
curved files on the roofs seemed delicate, almost lace like compared to
the heavy ones needed to cope with the winds and snow of Manchuria.  In
the distance, through the mist, she could see little houses of bamboo
and earth set in the midst of dark-green mountains covered in camphor
trees, meta sequoia and tea bushes.  She felt unburdened at last, not
least because my father was letting his bodyguard carry her bedroll.
Having passed through scores of war-torn towns and villages, she was
delighted to see that here there was no war damage at all.  The

7,000-man Kuomintang garrison had surrendered without a fight.

My father was living in an elegant mansion which had been taken over by
the new government as combined offices and living quarters, and my
mother moved in with him.  It had a garden full of plants she had never
seen:

phoebe nanmu, papayas, and bananas, on grounds covered with green moss.
Goldfish swam in a tank, and there was even a turtle.  My father's
bedroom had a double sofa bed, the softest thing she had ever slept on,
having previously known only brick kangs.  Even in winter, all one
needed in Yibin was a quilt.  There was no biting wind or all-pervasive
dust like in Manchuria.  You did not have to wear a gauze scarf over
your face to be able to breathe.  The well was not covered with a lid;
there was a bamboo pole sticking out, with a bucket tied to the other
end for drawing water.

People washed their clothes on slabs of smooth shiny stones propped up
at a slight angle, and used palm-fiber brushes to clean them.  These
operations would have been impossible in Manchuria, where the clothes
would immediately have been either covered in dust or frozen solid. For
the first time in her life, my mother could eat rice and fresh
vegetables every day.

The following weeks were my parents' real honeymoon.

For the first time my mother could live with my father without being
criticized for 'putting love first."  The general atmosphere was
relaxed; the Communists were elated at their sweeping victories and my
father's colleagues did not insist on married couples staying together
only on Saturday nights.

Yibin had fallen less than two months earlier, on I i December 1949. My
father had arrived six days later, and had been appointed head of the
county of Yibin, which had a population of over a million people, about
100,000 of whom lived in the city of Yibin.  He had arrived by boat
with a group of more than a hundred students who had 'joined the
revolution' in Nanjing.  When the boat came up the Yangtze, it stopped
first at the Yibin power station on the riverbank opposite the city,
which had been a stronghold of the underground.  Several hundred
workers came out to greet my father's party on the quay, waving lit He
red paper flags with five stars the new flag of Communist China and
shouting welcoming slogans.  The flags had the stars in the wrong place
the local Communists did not know the right place to put them.  My
father went ashore with another officer to address the workers, who
were delighted when they heard him speaking in Yibin dialect.  Instead
of the ordinary army cap which everyone else was wearing he wore an old
eight-cornered cap of the type which the Communist army used to wear in
the 192os and early 193os, which struck the locals as unusual and
rather stylish.

Then the boat took them across the river to the city.  My father had
been away ten years.  He had been very fond of his family, especially
his youngest sister, to whom he had written enthusiastically from
Yan'an about his new life and how he wanted her to join him there
someday.  The letters had stopped coming as the Kuomintang tightened
its blockade, and the first the family had heard from my father for
many years was when they received the photo of him and my mother taken
in Nanjing.  For the previous seven years they had not even known if he
was alive.  They had missed him, cried at the thought of him, and
prayed to the Buddha for his safe return.  With the photograph he had
sent a note saying he would soon be in Yibin, and that he had changed
his name.  While in Yan'an, like many others, he had taken a nora de
guerre, Wang Yu.  Yu meant "Selfless to the point of being considered
foolish."  As soon as he arrived my father reverted to his real
surname, Chang, but he incorporated his nora de guerre and called
himself Chang Shou-yu, meaning "Keep Yu."

Ten years before, my father had left as a poor, hungry, and put-upon
apprentice; now he had returned, not yet thirty, as a powerful man.
This was a traditional Chinese dream, which has entered the language as
yi-jin-huanxiang, 'returning home robed in embroidered silk."  His
family was tremendously proud of him, and they were longing to see what
he was like after ten years, as they had heard all sorts of strange
things about the Communists.

And of course his mother, especially, wanted to know about his new
wife..

My father talked and laughed loudly and heartily.  He was the picture
of unrestrained, almost boyish excitement.

He has not changed after all, his mother thought with a sigh of relief
and happiness.  Through their traditional, deep-rooted reserve, the
family showed their joy in their eager, tear-filled eyes.  Only his
youngest sister was more animated.  She talked vividly while playing
with her long plaits, which every now and then she threw back over her
shoulder when she tilted her head to emphasize what she was saying.  My
father smiled as he recognized the traditional Sichuan gesture of
feminine playfulness.  He had almost forgotten it in his ten years of
austerity in the North.

There was a lot of catching up to do.  My father's mother was well into
her account of what had happened to the family since he had left when
she said there was one thing worrying her: what was going to happen to
her eldest daughter, who had looked after her in Chongqing.  This
daughter's husband had died and left her some land, which she had hired
a few laborers to work.  There were a lot of rumors flying around about
the Communists' land reform, and the family was worried that she would
be classified as a landlord and have her land taken away.  The women
became emotional, their worries shading into recriminations: "What is
going to happen to her?  How is she going to live?  How can the
Communists do a thing like this?"

My father was hurt and exasperated.  He burst out: "I have looked
forward so much to this day, to share our victory with you.  All
injustice is going to be a thing of the past.  It is a time to be
positive, to rejoice.  But you are so distrustful, so critical.  You
only want to find fault..."

Whereupon he burst into tears like a lit He boy.  The women all cried
too.  For him, they were tears of disappointment and frustration.  For
them, the feelings must have been more complex; among them were doubt
and uncertainty.

My father's mother was living in the old family home just outside the
city, which had been left to her by her husband when he died.  It was a
modestly luxurious country house low-lying, made of wood and brick, and
walled off from the road.  It had a big garden at the front, and at the
back was a field of winter plums, which gave off a delicious perfume,
and thick bamboo groves, which lent it the atmosphere of an enchanted
garden.  It was spotlessly clean.  All the windows were gleaming, and
there was not a speck of dust anywhere.  The furniture was made of
beautiful shiny padauk wood, which is a deep red, sometimes almost
shading into black.  My mother fell in love with the house from her
first visit, on the day after she arrived in Yibin.

This was an important occasion.  In Chinese tradition the person with
the most power over a married woman was always her mother-in-law, to
whom she had to be completely obedient and who would tyrannize her.
When she in turn became a mother-in-law, she would bully her own
daughter-in-law in the same way.  Liberating daughters-in-law was an
important Communist policy, and rumors abounded that Communist
daughters-in-law were arrogant dragons, ready to boss their
mothers-in-law around.  Everyone was on tenterhooks waiting to see how
my mother would behave.

My father had a very large extended family, and they all gathered in
the house that day.  As my mother approached the front gate, she heard
people whispering, "She's coming, she's coming!"  Adults were shushing
their children, who were jumping around trying to catch a glimpse of
the strange Communist daughter-in-law from the far north.

When my mother entered the sitting room with my father, her
mother-in-law was seated at the far end on a formal, carved square
padauk chair.  Leading up to her on both sides of the room, enhancing
the formality, were two symmetrical rows of square, exquisitely carved
padauk chairs.  A small table with a vase or some other ornament on it
stood between every two chairs.  Walking up the middle, my mother saw
that her mother-in-law had a very calm face, with high cheekbones
(which my father had inherited), small eyes, a sharp chin, and thin
lips which drooped slightly at the corners.  She was tiny, and her eyes
seemed to be half closed, almost as though she were medltaling.  My
mother walked slowly up to her with my father, and stopped in front of
her chair.  Then she knelt and kowtowed three times.  This was the
correct thing to do according to the traditional ritual, but everyone
had been wondering if the young Communist would go through with it. The
room burst into relieved sighs.  My father's cousins and sisters
whispered to his obviously delighted mother:

"What a lovely daughter-in-law!  So gentle, so pretty, and so
respectful!  Mother, you are really in good fortune?

My mother was quite proud of her little conquest.  She and my father
had spent some time discussing what to do.

The Communists had said they were going to get rid of kowtowing, which
they considered an insult to human dignity, but my mother wanted to
make an exception, just this once.  My father agreed.  He did not want
to hurt his mother, or offend his wife not after the miscarriage; and
besides, this kowtow was different.  It was to make a point for the
Communists.  But he would not kowtow himself, although it was expected
of him.

All the women in my father's family were Buddhists, and one of his
sisters, Jun-ying, who was unmarried, was particularly devout.  She
took my mother to kowtow to a statue of the Buddha, to the shrines of
the family ancestors which were set up on Chinese New Year, and even to
the groves of winter plum.~ and bamboo in the back garden.

Aunt Jun-ying believed that every flower and every tree had a spirit.
She would ask my mother to do a dozen kowtows to the bamboos to beg
them not to flower, which the Chinese believed portended disaster.  My
mother found all this great fun.  It reminded her of her childhood and
gave her a chance to indulge her sense of playfulness.  My father did
not approve, but she mollified him by saying it was just a performance
to help the Communists' image.

The Kuomintang had said the Communists would wipe out all traditional
customs, and she said it was important for people to see that this was
not happening.

My father's family was very kind to my mother.  In spite of her initial
formality, my grandmother was in fact extremely easygoing.  She seldom
passed judgment, and was never critical.  Aunt Jun-ying's round face
was marked by smallpox, but her eyes were so gentle that anyone could
see that she was a kind woman, with whom they could feel safe and
relaxed.  My mother could not help comparing her new in-laws with her
own mother.  They did not exude her energy and sprightliness, but their
ease and serenity made my mother feel completely at home.  Aunt
Jun-ying cooked delicious spicy Sichuan food, which is quite different
from the bland northern food.  The dishes had exotic names which my
mother loved: 'tiger fights the dragon," 'imperial concubine chicken,"
'hot saucy duck," 'suckling golden cock crows to the dawn."  My mother
went to the house often, and would eat with the family, looking out
into the orchard of plums, almonds, and peaches which made a sea of
pink and white blossoms in early spring.  She found a warm, welcoming
atmosphere among the women in the Chang family, and felt very much
loved by them.

My mother was soon assigned a job in the Public Affairs Department of
the government of Yibin County.  She spent very little time in the
office.  The first priority was to feed the population and this was
beginning to be difficult.

The southwest was the last holdout of the Kuomintang leadership, and a
quarter of a million soldiers had been stranded in Sichuan when Chiang
Kai-shek fled the province for Taiwan in December 1949.  Sichuan was,

zo8 "Returning Home Robed in Embroidered Silk' moreover, one of the few
places where the Communists had not occupied the countryside before
they took the cities.  Kuomintang units, disorganized but often well
armed, still controlled much of the countryside in southern Sichuan,
and most of the food supply was in the hands of landlords who were
pro-Kuomintang.  The Communists urgently needed to secure supplies to
feed the cities, as well as their own forces and the large numbers of
Kuomintang troops who had surrendered.

At first they sent people out to try to buy food.  Many of the big
landlords had traditionally had their own private armies, which now
joined up with the bands of Kuomintang soldiers.  A few days after my
mother reached Yibin, these forces launched a full-scale uprising in
south Sichuan.  Yibin was in danger of starvation.

The Communists started sending out armed teams made up of officials
escorted by army guards to collect food.  Almost everyone was
mobilized.  Government offices were empty.  In the whole of the Yibin
county government only two women were left behind: one was a
receptionist and the other had a newborn baby.

My mother went on a number of these expeditions, which lasted many days
at a time.  There were thirteen people in her team: seven civilians and
six soldiers.  My mother's gear consisted of a bedroll, a bag of rice,
and a heavy umbrella made of tung-oil-painted canvas, all of which she
had to carry on her back.  The team had to trek for days through wild
country and over what the Chinese call 'sheep's-intestine trails'
treacherous narrow mountain paths winding around steep precipices and
gullies.

When they came to a village they would go to the shabbiest hovel and
try to form a rapport with the very poor peasants, telling them that
the Communists would give people like them their own land and a happy
life, and then asking them which landowners had rice hoarded.  Most of
the peasants had inherited a traditional fear and suspicion of any
officials.  Many had only vaguely heard of the Communists,

To Family and Bandits 2oq and everything they had heard was bad; but my
mother, having quickly modified her northern dialect with a local
accent, was highly articulate and persuasive.  Explaining the new
policy turned out to be her forte.  If the team succeeded in getting
information about the landlords, they would go and try to persuade them
to sell at designated collection points, where they would be paid on
delivery.

Some were scared and disgorged without much fuss.

Others informed on the team's whereabouts to one of the armed gangs. My
mother and her comrades were often fired at, and spent every night on
the alert, sometimes having to move from place to place to avoid
attack.

At first they would stay with poor peasants.  But if the bandits found
out someone had helped them, they would kill the entire household.
After a number of killings, the team decided they could not jeopardize
innocent people's lives.  So they slept in the open, or in abandoned
temples.

On her third expedition, my mother started vomiting and suffering from
dizzy spells.  She was pregnant again.

She got back to Yibin exhausted and desperate for a rest, but her team
had to set off on another expedition at once.

It had been left vague what a pregnant woman should do, and she was
torn about whether to go or not.  She wanted to go, and the mood at the
time was very much one of self sacrifice it was considered shameful to
complain about anything.  But she was frightened by the memory of her
miscarriage only five months before, and by the thought of having
another one in the midst of the wilderness, where there were no doctors
or transportation.  Moreover, the expeditions involved almost daily bat
ties with the bandits, and it was important to be able to run and run
fast.  Even walking made her dizzy.

Still, she decided to go.  There was one other woman going, who was
also pregnant.  One afternoon the team was settling down for lunch in a
deserted courtyard.  They assumed the owner had fled, probably from
them.  The shoulder-high mud walls which ran around the weed-covered
yard had collapsed
in several places.  The wooden gate was unlocked and was creaking in
the spring breeze.

The team's rice was being prepared in the abandoned kitchen by their
cook, when a middle-aged man appeared.

He had the appearance of a peasant: he was wearing straw sandals and
loose trousers, with a big apronlike piece of cloth tucked up on one
side into a cotton cummerbund, and he had a dirty white turban on his
head.  He told them that a gang of men belonging to a notorious group
of bandits known as the Broadsword Brigade was headed their way and
that they were especially keen to capture my mother and the other woman
in the team, because they knew they were the wives of high Communist
officials.

This man was not an ordinary peasant.  Under the Kuomintang, he had
been the chieftain of the local township, which governed a number of
villages, including the one the team was in.  The Broadsword Brigade
had tried to win his cooperation, as they did with all former
Kuomintang men and landlords.  He had joined the brigade, but he wanted
to keep his options open, and he was tipping off the Communists to buy
insurance.  He told them the best way to escape.

The team immediately jumped up and ran.  But my mother and the other
pregnant woman could not move very fast, so the chieftain led them out
through a gap in the wall and helped them hide in a haystack nearby.
The cook lingered in the kitchen to wrap up the cooked rice and pour
cold water onto the wok to cool it down so that he could take it with
him.  The rice and the wok were too precious to be abandoned; an iron
wok was hard to obtain, especially in wartime.  Two of the soldiers
stayed in the kitchen helping him and trying to hurry him up.  At last
the cook grabbed the rice and the wok and the three of them raced for
the back door.  But the bandits were already coming through the front
door, and caught up with them after a few yards.  They fell on them and
knifed them to death.  The gang was short of guns and did not have
enough

To Family and Bandits 21 I ammunition to shoot at the rest of the team,
whom they could see not far away.  They did not discover my mother and
the other woman in the haystack.

Not long afterward the gang was captured, along with the chieftain.  He
was both a leader of the gang and one of the 'snakes in their old
haunts," which made him eligible for execution.  But he had tipped off
the team and saved the lives of the two women.  At the time, death
sentences had to be endorsed by a three-man review board.  It happened
that the head of the tribunal was my father.  The second member was the
husband of the other pregnant woman, and the third was the local police
chief.

The tribunal split two to one.  The husband of the other woman voted to
spare the chieftain's life.  My father and the police chief voted to
uphold the death sentence.  My mother pleaded with the tribunal to let
the man live, but my father was adamant.  This was exactly what the man
had been banking on, he told my mother: he had chosen this particular
team to tip off precisely because he knew it contained the wives of two
important officials.

"He has a lot of blood on his hands," my father said.  The husband of
the other woman disagreed vehemently.

"But," my father retorted, banging his fist on the table, 'we cannot be
lenient, precisely because our wives are involved.  If we let personal
feelings influence our judgment, what would be the difference between
the new China and the old?"  The chieftain was executed.

My mother could not forgive my father for this.  She felt that the man
should not die, because he had saved so many lives, and my father, in
particular, 'owed' him a life.  The way she looked at it, which was how
most Chinese would have seen it, my father's behavior meant he did not
treasure her, unlike the husband of the other woman.

No sooner was the trial over than my mother's team was sent off to the
countryside again.  She was still feeling very sick from her pregnancy,
vomiting a lot and exhausted all the time.  She had had pains in her
abdomen ever since the violent rush to the haystack.  The husband of
the other pregnant woman decided he was not going to let his wife go
again.

"I will protect my pregnant wife," he said.

"And I will protect any wives who are pregnant.  No pregnant woman
should have to undergo such dangers."  But he met fierce opposition
from my mother's boss, Mrs.  Mi, a peasant woman who had been a
guerrilla.  It was unthinkable for a peasant woman to take a rest if
she was pregnant.

She worked right up to the moment of delivery, and there were
innumerable stories about women cutting the umbilical cord with a
sickle and carrying on.  Mrs.  Mi had borne her own baby on a
battlefield and had had to abandon it on the spot a baby's cry could
have endangered the whole unit.  After losing her child, she seemed to
want others to suffer a similar fate.  She insisted on sending my
mother off again, producing a very effective argument.  At the time, no
Party members were allowed to marry except relatively senior officials
(those who qualified as '28-7-regiment-I ').

Any woman who was pregnant, therefore, was virtually bound to be a
member of the elite.  And if they did not go, how could the Party hope
to persuade other people to go?

My father agreed with her, and told my mother she ought togo.

My mother accepted this, in spite of her fears of another miscarriage.
She was prepared to die, but she had hoped that my father would be
against her going and would say so; that way she would have felt he put
her safety first.

But she could see that my father's first loyalty was to the revolution,
and she was bitterly disappointed.

She spent several painful and exhausting weeks traipsing around the
hills and mountains.  The skirmishes were intensifying.  Almost every
day came news of members of other teams being tortured and murdered by
bandits.  They were particularly sadistic to women.  One day the corpse
of one of my father's nieces was dumped just outside the city gate: she
had been raped and knifed, and her vagina was a bloody mess.  Another
young woman was caught by the

Broadsword Brigade during a skirmish.  They were surrounded by armed
Communists, so they tied the woman up and told her to shout out to her
comrades to let them escape.  Instead she shouted, "Go ahead, don't
worry about me!"  Every time she called out one of the bandits cut a
hunk out of her flesh with a knife.  She died horribly mutilated. After
several such incidents, it was decided that women would not be sent on
food-collecting expeditions anymore.

Meanwhile, in Jinzhou my grandmother had been worrying constantly about
her daughter.  As soon as she got a letter from her saying she had
arrived in Yibin, she decided to go and make sure she was all right. In
March 195o she set off on her own long march across China, alone.

She knew nothing about the rest of the huge country, and imagined that
Sichuan was not only mountainous and cut off, but also lacking in the
daily necessities of life.  Her first instinct was to take a large
supply of basic goods with her.  But the country was still in a state
of upheaval, and fighting was still going on along her intended route;
she realized she was going to have to carry her own luggage, and
probably walk a good deal of the way, which was extremely difficult on
bound feet.  In the end she set fled on one small bundle, which she
could carry herself.

Her feet had grown bigger since she had married Dr.  Xia.  By
tradition, the Manchus did not practice foot binding so my grandmother
had taken off the binding cloths and her feet gradually grew a little. 
This process was almost as painful as the original binding.  The broken
bones could not mend, of course, so the feet did not go back to their
original shape, but remained crippled and shrunken.  My grandmother
wanted her feet to look normal, so she used to stuff cotton wool into
her shoes.

Before she left, Lin Xiao-xia, the man who had brought her to my
parents' wedding, gave her a document which said she was the mother of
a revolutionary; with this, Party

214 "Returning Horne Robed in Embroidered Silk' organizations along the
way would provide her with food, accommodations, and money.  She
followed almost the same route as my parents, taking the train part of
the way, sometimes traveling in trucks, and walking when there was no
other transportation.  Once she was on an open truck with some women
and children who all belonged to families of Communists.  The truck
stopped for some of the children to have a pee.  The moment it did so
bullets ripped into the wooden planks around the side.  My grandmother
hunkered down in the back while bullets zinged by inches above her
head.  The guards fired back with machine guns and managed to silence
the attackers, who turned out to be Kuomintang stragglers.  My
grandmother emerged unscathed, but several of the children and some of
the guards were killed.

When she got to Wuhan, a big city in central China, which was about
two-thirds of the way, she was told that the next stretch, by boat up
the Yangtze, was unsafe because of bandits.  She had to wait a month
until things quieted down even so, her ship was attacked several times
from the shore.  The boat, which was rather ancient, had a flat, open
deck, so the guards built a wall of sandbags about four feet high down
both sides of it, with slits for their guns.  It looked like a floating
fortress.  Whenever it was fired on, the captain would put it on full
steam ahead and try to race through the fusillade, while the guards
shot back from behind their sandbagged embrasures.  My grandmother
would go belowdecks and wait until the shooting was over.

She changed to a smaller boat at Yichang and passed through the Yangtze
Gorges, and by May she was near Yibin, sitting in a boat covered with
palm fronds, sailing quietly among crystal-clear ripples, the breeze
scented with orange blossom.

The boat was rowed upstream by a dozen oarsmen.  As they rowed they
sang traditional Sichuan opera arias and improvised songs about the
names of the villages they were passing, the legends of the hills, and
the spirits of the bamboo groves.  They sang about their moods too.  My
grandmother was most amused by the flirtatious songs they sang to one
of the female passengers, with a twinkle in their eye.  She could not
understand most of the expressions they used, because they were in
Sichuan dialect, but she could tell they were sexually suggestive by
the way the passengers gave out low laughs betraying both pleasure and
embarrassment.  She had heard about the Sichuan character, which was
supposed to be as saucy and spicy as the food.  My grandmother was in a
happy mood.  She did not know that my mother had had several close
shaves with death, nor had my mother said anything about her
miscarriage.

It was mid-May when she arrived.  The journey had taken over two
months.  My mother, who had been feeling sick and miserable, was
ecstatic at seeing her again.  My father was not so pleased.  Yibin was
the first time he had been alone with my mother in an even semi-stable
situation.  He had only just gotten away from his mother-inlaw, and now
here she was again, when he had hoped she was a thousand miles away. He
was well aware that he was no match for the bonds between mother and
daughter.

My mother was seething with resentment against my father.  Since the
bandit threat had become more acute, the quasi-military life-style had
been reinstated.  And because they were both away so much, my mother
rarely spent the night with my father.  He was traveling around the
country most of the time, investigating conditions in the rural areas,
hearing the peasants' complaints, and dealing with every kind of
problem, particularly ensuring the food supply.  Even when he was in
Yibin, my father would work late at the office.  My parents were seeing
less and less of each other, and were drifting apart again.

The arrival of my grandmother reopened old wounds.

She was allotted a room in the courtyard where my parents were living.
At the time, all officials were living on a comprehensive allowance
system called gong-ji-zhi.  They

2 x6 "Returning Home Robed in Embroidered Silk' received no salary, but
the state provided them with housing, food, clothing, and daily
necessities, plus a tiny amount of pocket money as in an army. Everyone
had to eat in canteens, where the food was meager and unappetizing.

You were not allowed to cook at home, even if you had cash from some
other source.

When my grandmother arrived she started selling some of her jewelry to
buy food in the market; she was especially keen to cook for my mother
because it was traditionally thought vital for pregnant women to eat
well.  But soon complaints started pouring in via Mrs.  Mi about my
mother being 'bourgeois' getting privileged treatment and using up
precious fuel which, like food, had to be collected from the
countryside.  She was also criticized for being 'pampered'; having her
mother there was bad for her reeducation.  My father made a
self-criticism to his Party organization and ordered my grandmother to
stop cooking at home.  My mother resented this, and so did my
grandmother.

"Can't you stand up for me just once?"  my mother said bitterly.

"The baby I am carrying is yours as well as mine, and it needs
nourishment!"  Eventually my father conceded a little: my grandmother
could cook at home twice a week, but no more.  Even this was breaking
the rules, he said.

It turned out that my grandmother was breaking a more important rule.
Only officials of a certain rank were entitled to have their parents
staying with them, and my mother did not qualify.  Because officials
did not receive salaries, the state was responsible for looking after
their dependants, and wanted to keep the numbers down.  Even though my
father was senior enough, he let his own mother continue to be
supported by Aunt Jun-ying.  My mother pointed out that her mother
would not be a burden on the state, because she had enough jewelry to
support herself, and she had been invited to stay with Aunt Jun-ying.
Mrs.  Mi said my grandmother should not be there at all and would have
to go back to Manchuria.  My father agreed.

My mother argued vehemently with him, but he said that a rule was a
rule and he would not fight to have it bent.  In old China one of the
major vices was that anyone with power was above the rules, and an
important component of the Communist revolution was that officials,
like everyone else, should be subject to rules.  My mother was in
tears.  She was afraid of having another miscarriage.

Perhaps my father could consider her safety and let her mother stay
until the birth?  Still he said no.

"Corruption always starts with lit He things like this.  This is the
sort of thing that will erode our revolution."  My mother could not
find any argument to win him over.  He has no feelings, she thought. He
does not put my interests first.  He does not love me.

My grandmother had to go, and my mother was never to forgive my father
for this.  My grandmother had been with her daughter for little more
than a month, having spent over two months traveling across China, at
the risk of her life.  She was afraid my mother might have another
miscarriage, and she did not trust the medical services in Yibin.
Before she left she went to see my aunt Jun-ying and solemnly kowtowed
to her, saying she was leaving my mother in her care.  My aunt was sad,
too.  She was worried about my mother, and wanted my grandmother to be
there for the birth.  She went to plead with her brother, but he would
not budge.

With a heavy heart, and amid bitter tears, my grandmother hobbled down
to the quay with my mother to take the little boat back down the
Yangtze on the start of the long and uncertain journey back to
Manchuria.  My mother stood on the riverbank, waving as the boat
disappeared into the mist, and wondering if she would ever see her
mother again.

It was July 195o.  My mother's one-year provisional membership in the
Party was due to end, and her Party cell was grilling her intensively.
It had only three members:

my mother, my father's bodyguard, and my mother's boss,

Mrs.  Mi.  There were so few Party members in Yibin that these three
had been thrown together rather incongruously.  The other two, who were
both full members, were leaning toward turning down my mother's
application, but they did not give a straightforward no.  They just
kept grilling her and forcing her to make endless self-criticisms.

For each self-criticism, there were many criticisms.  My mother's two
comrades insisted that she had behaved in a 'bourgeois' manner.  They
said she had not wanted to go to the country to help collect food; when
she pointed out that she had gone, in line with the Party's wishes,
they retorted: "Ah, but you didn't really want to go."  Then they
accused her of having enjoyed privileged food cooked, moreover, by her
mother at home and of succumbing to illness more than most pregnant
women.  Mrs.  Mi also criticized her because her mother had made
clothes for the baby.

"Who ever heard of a baby wearing new clothes?"

she said.

"Such a bourgeois waste!  Why can't she just wrap the baby up in old
clothes like everyone else?"  The fact that my mother had shown her
sadness that my grandmother had to leave was singled out as definitive
proof that she 'put family first," a serious offense.

The summer of 195o was the hottest in living memory, with high humidity
and temperatures above 100 F. My mother had been washing every day, and
she was attacked for this, too.  Peasants, especially in the North
where Mrs.  Mi came from, washed very rarely, because of the shortage
of water.  In the guerrillas, men and women used to compete to see who
had the most 'revolutionary insects' (lice).

Cleanliness was regarded as un proletarian  When the steamy summer
turned into cool autumn my father's bodyguard weighed in with a new
accusation: my mother was 'behaving like a Kuomintang official's grand
lady' because she had used my father's leftover hot water.  At the
time, in order to save fuel, there was a rule that only officials above
a certain rank were entitled to wash with hot water.

My father fell into this group, but my mother did not.  She had been
strongly advised by the women in my father's family not to touch cold
water when she came near to delivery time.  After the bodyguard's
criticism, my father would not let my mother use his water.  My mother
felt like screaming at him for not taking her side against the endless
intrusions into the most irrelevant recesses of her life.

The Party's all-around intrusion into people's lives was the very point
of the process known as 'thought reform."

Mao wanted not only external discipline, but the total subjection of
all thoughts, large or small.  Every week a meeting for 'thought
examination' was held for those 'in the revolution."  Everyone had both
to criticize themselves for incorrect thoughts and be subjected to the
criticism of others.

The meetings tended to be dominated by self-righteous and petty-minded
people, who used them to vent their envy and frustration; people of
peasant origin used them to attack those from 'bourgeois' backgrounds.
The idea was that people should be reformed to be more like peasants,
because the Communist revolution was in essence a peasant revolution.
This process appealed to the guilt feelings of the educated; they had
been living better than the peasants, and self-criticism tapped into
this.

Meetings were an important means of Communist control.  They left
people no free time, and eliminated the private sphere.  The pettiness
which dominated them was justified on the grounds that prying into
personal details was a way of ensuring thorough soul-cleansing.  In
fact, pettiness was a fundamental characteristic of a revolution in
which intrusiveness and ignorance were celebrated, and envy was
incorporated into the system of control.  My mother's cell grilled her
week after week, month after month, forcing her to produce endless
self-criticisms.

She had to consent to this agonizing process.  Life for a revolutionary
was meaningless if they were rejected by the Party.  It was like
excommunication for a Catholic.  Besides, it was standard procedure. My
father had gone through it and had accepted it as part of 'joining the
revolution."  In fact, he was still going through it.  The Party had
never hidden the fact that it was a painful process.  He told my mother
her anguish was normal.

At the end of all this, my mother's two comrades voted against full
Party membership for her.  She fell into a deep depression.  She had
been devoted to the revolution, and could not accept the idea that it
did not want her; it was particularly galling to think she might not
get in for completely petty and irrelevant reasons, decided by two
people whose way of thinking seemed light years away from what she had
conceived the Party's ideology to be.  She was being kept out of a
progressive organization by backward people, and yet the revolution
seemed to be telling her that it was she who was in the wrong.  At the
back of her mind was another, more practical point which she did not
even spell out to herself: it was vital to get into the Party, because
if she failed she would be stigmatized and ostracized.

With these thoughts churning through her mind, my mother came to feel
the world was against her.  She dreaded seeing people and spent as much
time as possible alone, crying to herself.  Even this she had to
conceal, as it would have been considered as showing lack of faith in
the revolution.  She found she could not blame the Party, which seemed
to her to be in the right, so she blamed my father, first for making
her pregnant and then for not standing by her when she was attacked and
rejected.  Many times she wandered along the quay, gazing down into the
muddy waters of the Yangtze, and thought of committing suicide to
punish him, picturing to herself how he would be filled with remorse
when he found she had killed herself.

The recommendation of her cell had to be approved by a higher
authority, which consisted of three open-minded intellectuals.  They
thought my mother had been treated unfairly, but the Party rules made
it difficult for them to overturn the recommendation of her cell.  So
they procrastinated.  This was relatively easy because the three were
seldom in one place at the same time.  Like my father and
the other male officials, they were usually
away in different parts of the countryside foraging for food and
fighting bandits.  Knowing that Yibin was almost undefended, and driven
to desperation by the fact that all their escape routes both to Taiwan
and through Yunnan to Indochina and Burma had been cut, a sizable army
of Kuomintang stragglers, landlords, and bandits laid siege to the
city, and for a time it looked as though it was going to fall.  My
father raced back from the countryside as soon as he heard about the
attack.

The fields started just outside the city walls and there was vegetation
to within a few yards of the gates.  Using this for cover, the
attackers managed to get right up to the walls and began to pound the
north gate with huge battering rams.  In the vanguard was the
Broadsword Brigade, consisting largely of unarmed peasants who had
drunk 'holy water' which, they believed, made them immune to bullets.
The Kuomintang soldiers were behind them.  At first the Communist army
commander tried to aim his fire at the Kuomintang, not at the peasants,
whom he hoped to scare into retreating.

Even though my mother was seven months pregnant, she joined the other
women in taking food and water to the defenders on the walls and
carrying the wounded to the rear.  Thanks to the training she had had
at school, she was good at first aid.  She was also brave.  After about
a week, the attackers abandoned the siege and the Communists
counterattacked, mopping up virtually all armed resistance in the area
for good.

Immediately after this, land reform started in the Yibin area.  The
Communists had passed an agrarian reform law that summer, which was the
key to their program for transforming China.  The basic concept, which
they called 'the land returning home," was to redistribute all
farmland, as well as draft animals and houses, so that every farmer
owned a more or less equal amount of land.  Landowners were to be
allowed to keep a plot, on the same basis as everyone else.  My father
was one of the people running the program.  My mother was excused from
going to the villages because of her advanced pregnancy.

Yibin was a rich place.  A local saying has it that with one year's
work, peasants could live at ease for two.  But decades of incessant
warfare had devastated the land; on top of this had come heavy taxes to
pay for the fighting and for the eight-year war against Japan.
Depredations had escalated when Chiang Kai-shek moved his wartime
capital to Sichuan, and corrupt officials and carpetbaggers had
descended on the province.  The last straw came when the Kuomintang
made Sichuan their final redoubt in 1949 and levied exorbitant taxes
just before the Communists arrived.  All this, plus greedy landlords,
had combined to produce appalling poverty in the rich province.  Eighty
percent of the peasants did not have enough to feed their families.  If
the crops failed, many were reduced to eating herbs and the leaves of
sweet potatoes, which were normally fed to pigs.  Starvation was
widespread, and life expectancy was only about forty years.  The
poverty in such a rich land was one of the reasons my father had been
attracted to communism in the first place.

In Yibin the land reform drive was on the whole nonviolent, partly
because the fiercer landlords had been involved in the rebellions
during the first nine months of Communist rule and had already been
killed in battle or executed.  But there was some violence.  In one
case a Party member raped the female members of a landowner's family
and then mutilated them by cutting off their breasts.  My father
ordered that the man be executed.

One bandit gang had captured a young Communist, a university graduate,
while he was out in the country looking for food.  The bandit chief
ordered him to be cut in half.

The chief was later caught, and beaten to death by the Communist land
reform team leader, who had been a friend of the man who had been
killed.  The team leader then cut out the chief's heart and ate it to
demonstrate his revenge.  My father ordered the team leader to be
dismissed from his job, but not shot.  He reasoned that while he had
engaged in a form of brutality, it was not against an innocent person
but a murderer, and a cruel one at that.

The land reform took over a year to complete.  In the majority of
cases, the worst the landlords suffered was the loss of most of their
land and their homes.  So-called open-minded landlords, those who had
not joined the armed rebellion, or who had actually helped the
Communist underground, were treated well.  My parents had friends whose
families were local landlords, and had been to dinner at their grand
old houses before they were confiscated and divided up among the
peasants.

My father was completely wrapped up in his work, and was not in town
when my mother gave birth to her first child, a girl, on 8 November.
Because Dr.  Xia had given my mother the name De-hong, which
incorporates the character for 'wild swan' (Hong) with a generation
name (De), my father named my sister Xiao-hong, which means 'to be
like' (Xiao) my mother.  Seven days after my sister's birth Aunt
Jun-ying had my mother brought home from the hospital to the Chang
house on a bamboo litter carried by two men.  When my father got back a
few weeks later, he said to my mother that, as a Communist, she should
not have allowed herself to be carried by other human beings.

She said she had done it because, according to traditional wisdom,
women were not supposed to walk for a while after a birth.  To this my
father replied: what about the peasant women who have to carry on
working in the fields immediately after they give birth?

My mother was still in a deep depression, uncertain whether she could
stay in the Party or not.  Unable to let her rage out on my father or
the Party, she blamed her baby daughter for her misery.  Four days
after they came out of the hospital, my sister cried all through the
night.

My mother was at the end of her tether, and screamed at her and smacked
her quite hard.  Aunt Jun-ying, who was sleeping in the next room,
rushed in and said: "You're exhausted.  Let me look after her."  From
then on my aunt looked after my sister.  When my mother went back to
her own place a few weeks later my sister stayed on with Aunt Jun-ying
in the family house.

To this day my mother remembers with grief and remorse the night she
hit my sister.  When my mother went to see her, Xiao-hong used to hide,
and in a tragic reversal of what had happened to her as a young child
at General Xue's mansion my mother would not allow Xiao-hong to call
her "Mother."

My aunt found a wet-nurse for my sister.  Under the allowance system
the state paid for a wet-nurse for every newborn baby in an official's
family, and also provided free physical checkups for the wet-nurses,
who were treated as state employees.  They were not servants, and did
not even have to wash diapers.  The state could afford to pay for them
since, according to the Party's rules governing people 'in the
revolution," the only ones who were allowed to marry were senior
officials, and they produced relatively few babies.

The wet-nurse was in her late teens, and her own baby had been
stillborn.  She had married into a landlord family who had now lost
their income from the land.  She did not want to work as a peasant, but
wanted to be with her husband, who taught and lived in Yibin City.
Through mutual friends she was put in touch with my aunt and went to
live in the Chang family house with her husband.

Gradually my mother began to pull out of her depression.  After the
birth she was allowed thirty days' statutory leave, which she spent
with her mother-in-law and Aunt Jun-ying.  When she went back to work
she moved to a new job in the Communist Youth League of Yibin City, in
connection with a complete reorganization of the region.

The region of Yibin, covering an area of about 7,500 square miles and
with a population of over two million, was redivided into nine rural
counties and one city, Yibin.

My father became a member of the four-man committee which governed the
whole of the region and the head of the Depa~iment of Public Affairs
for the region.

This reorganization transferred Mrs.  Mi and brought my mother a new
boss: the head of the Department of Public Affairs for the city of
Yibin, which controlled the Youth League.  In Communist China, in spite
of the formal rules, the personality of one's immediate boss was far
more important than in the West.  The boss's attitude is the Party's.
Having a nice boss makes all the difference to one's life.

My mother's new chief was a woman called Zhang Xiting.  She and her
husband had been in an army unit which was part of the force earmarked
to take Tibet in 195o.

Sichuan was the staging post for Tibet, which was considered the back
of beyond by Han Chinese.  The couple had asked to be discharged and
were sent to Yibin instead.

Her husband was called Liu Jie-ting.  He had changed his name to
Jie-ting ("Linked to Ting') to show how much he admired his wife.  The
couple became known as 'the two Tings."

In the spring my mother was promoted to head of the Youth League, an
important job for a woman not yet twenty.  She had recovered her
equilibrium and much of her old bounce.  It was in this atmosphere that
I was conceived, in June 1951.

Heaven'-living

My mother was now in a new Party cell, made up of herself, Mrs.  Ting,
and a third woman who had been in the Yibin underground, with whom my
mother got on very well.  The nonstop intrusion and demands for
self-criticisms came to an immediate halt.  Her new cell quickly voted
for her to become a full Party member, and in July she was given Party
membership.

Her new boss, Mrs.  Ting, was no beauty, but her slender figure,
sensuous mouth, freckled face, lively eyes, and sharp repartee all
exuded energy and showed she was a character.  My mother warmed to her
at once.

Instead of sniping at her like Mrs.  Mi, Mrs.  Ting let my mother do
all sorts of things she wanted, like reading novels; before, readin, g
a book without a Marxist cover would bring down a rain of criticism
about being a bourgeois intellectual.  Mrs.  Ting allowed my mother
to

Living with an Incorruptible Man 227 go to the cinema on her own, which
was a great privilege, as at the time those 'with the revolution' were
allowed to see only Soviet films and even then only in organized groups
whereas the public cinemas, which were privately owned, were still
showing old American films, such as Charlie Chaplin's.  Another thing
which meant a lot to my mother was that she could now have a bath every
other day.

One day my mother went to the market with Mrs.  Ting and bought two
yards of fine pink flower-patterned cotton from Poland.  She had seen
the cloth before, but had not dared to buy it for fear of being
criticized for being frivolous.  Soon after she had reached Yibin, she
had had to hand in her army uniform and return to her "Lenin suit."

Under that she wore a shapeless, undyed, rough cotton shirt.  There was
no rule saying it was compulsory to wear this garb, but anyone who did
not do the same as everybody else would come in for criticism.  My
mother had been longing to wear a dash of color.  She and Mrs.  Ting
rushed over to the Changs' house with the cloth in a state of high
excitement.  In no time, four pretty blouses were ready, two for each
of them.  Next day they wore them under their Lenin jackets.  My mother
turned her pink collar out and spent the whole day feeling terribly
excited and nervous.

Mrs.  Ting was even more daring; she not only turned her collar outside
her uniform, but rolled up her sleeves so that a broad band of pink
showed on each arm.

My mother was staggered, almost awestruck, at this defiance.  As
expected, there were plenty of disapproving glances.  But Mrs.  Ting
held her chin up: "Who cares?"  she said to my mother.  My mother was
tremendously relieved;

with the sanction of her boss, she could ignore any criticisms, verbal
or wordless.

One reason Mrs.  Ting was not frightened of bending the rules a bit was
that she had a powerful husband, who was less scrupulous in exercising
his power.  A sharp-nosed, sharp-chinned, and slightly hunched man of
my father's age, Mr.  Ting was head of the Party Organization
Department for the region of Yibin, which was a very important
position, as this department was in charge of promotions, demotions,
and punishments.  It also kept the files of Party members.  In
addition, Mr.  Ting, like my father, was a member of the four-man
committee governing the region of Yibin.

In the Youth League my mother was working with people her own age. They
were better educated, more carefree, and more ready to see the humorous
side of things than the older, self-righteous, peasant-turned
Party-official women she had been working with before.

Her new colleagues liked dancing, they went on picnics together, and
they enjoyed talking about books and ideas.

Having a responsible job also meant my mother was treated with more
respect, and this increased as people realized that she was extremely
capable as well as dynamic.

As she grew to be more confident and to rely less on my father, she
felt less disappointed with him.  Besides, she was getting used to his
attitudes; she had stopped expecting him always to put her first, and
was much more at peace with the world.

Another bonus of my mother's promotion was that it qualified her to
bring her mother to Yibin on a permanent basis.  At the end of August z
95 x, after an exhausting journey, my grandmother and Dr.  Xia arrived;
the transportation system was working properly again and they had
traveled the whole way by regular train and boat.  As dependants of a
government official, they were assigned lodgings at the state's
expense, a three-room house in a guesthouse compound.  They received a
free ration of basic goods, like rice and fuel, which were delivered to
them by the manager of the compound, and they were also given a small
allowance to buy other food.  My sister and her wet-nurse went to live
with them, and my mother spent most of her brief spare time there,
enjoying my grandmother's delicious cooking.

My mother was delighted to have her mother and Dr.  Xia, whom she loved
with her.  She was particularly glad that they were no longer in
Jinzhou, as war had recently broken out in Korea, on the doorstep of
Manchuria; at one point in late 195o American troops had stood on the
banks of the Yalu River, on the border between Korea and China, and
American planes had bombed and strafed towns in Manchuria.

One of the first things my mother wanted to know was what had happened
to Hui-ge, the young colonel.  She was devastated to hear that he had
been executed by firing squad, by the bend in the river outside the
western gate of Jinzhou.

For the Chinese, one of the most terrible things that could happen was
not to have a proper burial.  They believed that only when the body was
covered and placed deep in the earth could the dead find peace.  This
was a religious feeling, but it also had a practical side: if the body
was not buried, it would be torn to pieces by wild dogs and picked to
the bone by birds.  In the past, the bodies of people who had been
executed had traditionally been exposed for three days as a lesson to
the population; only then were the corpses collected and given a sort
of burial.

Now the Communists issued an order that the family should immediately
bury an executed relative; if they could not do it, the task was
carried out by grave diggers hired by the government.

My grandmother had gone herself to the execution ground.  Hui-ge's body
had been left lying on the ground, fiddled with bullets, one of a row
of corpses.  He had been shot along with fifteen other people.  Their
blood had stained the snow dark red.  There was no one from his family
left in the city, so my grandmother had hired professional undertakers
to give him a decent burial.  She herself brought a long piece of red
silk in which to wrap his body.  My mother asked if there were other
people she knew there.  Yes, there had been.  My grandmother had z3o
"When a Man Gets Power..."

bumped into a woman she knew who was collecting the corpses of her
husband and her brother.  Both had been Kuomintang district chiefs.

My mother was also horrified to hear that my grandmother had been
denounced by her own sister-in-law, Yu-lin's wife.  She had long felt
put-upon by my grandmother, as she had to do the hard work around the
house, while my grandmother ran it as its mistress.  The Communists had
urged everyone to speak up about 'oppression and exploitation," so Mrs.
Yu-lin's grudges were given a political framework.  When my grandmother
collected Hui-ge's corpse Mrs.  Yu-lin denounced her for being well
disposed toward a criminal.  The neighborhood gathered to hold a
'struggle meeting' to 'help' my grandmother understand her 'faults." 
My grandmother had to attend, but wisely decided to say nothing and
appear meekly to accept the criticism.  Inwardly, she was fuming
against her sister-in-law and the Communists.

The episode did not help relations between my grandmother and my
father.  When he found out what she had done, he was enraged, saying
she was more in sympathy with the Kuomintang than with the Communists.
But it was obvious that he also felt a twinge of jealousy.  While she
hardly spoke to my father, my grandmother had been very fond of Hui-ge
and had considered him a good match for my mother.

My mother was caught in the middle between her mother and her husband;
and between her personal feelings, her grief over Hui-ge's death, and
her political feelings, her commitment to the Communists.

The execution of the colonel was part of a campaign to 'suppress
counterrevolution ari  Its goal was to eliminate all supporters of the
Kuomintang who had had power or influence, and it was triggered by the
Korean War, which had started in June 195o.  When US troops had come
right up to the Manchurian border Mao had feared the United States
might attack China, or unleash Chiang Kai-shek's army against the
mainland, or both.  He sent over a million men into Korea to fight on
the side of the North Koreans against the Americans.

Although Chiang Kai-shek's army never left Taiwan, the United States
did organize an invasion into southwest China by Kuomintang forces from
Burma; raids were also frequent in the coastal areas, many agents were
landed, and acts of sabotage increased.  Large numbers of Kuomintang
soldiers and bandits were still at large and there were sizable
rebellions in parts of the hinterland.  The Communists worried that
supporters of the Kuomintang might try to topple their newly
established order, and that if Chiang Kai-shek tried to stage a
comeback they would rise up as a fifth column.  They also wanted to
show people that they were there to stay, and getting rid of their
opponents was one way to impress the concept of stability on the
population, who had traditionally yearned for it.  However, opinions
were divided about the degree of ruthlessness necessary.  The new
government decided not to be fainthearted.  As one official document
put it: "If we do not kill them they will come back and kill us."

My mother was not convinced by the argument, but she decided there was
not much point trying to talk to my father about it.  In fact she
rarely saw him, as he spent much of the time away in the countryside,
troubleshooting.

Even when he was in town, she did not see much of him.

Officials were supposed to work from 8 a.m. until 11 p.m., seven days
a week, and one or both of them usually came home so late they hardly
had time to talk to each other.

Their baby daughter did not live with them, and they ate in the
canteen, so there was almost nothing one could call a home life.

Once the land reform was completed, my father was off again,
supervising the construction of the first proper road through the
region.  Formerly, the only link between Yibin and the outside world
had been by river.  The government decided to build a road south to the
province of Yunnan.

In only one year, using no machinery at all, they built over eighty
miles through a very hilly area, with numerous rivers.  The labor force
was made up of peasants, who worked in exchange for food.

During the digging, the peasants hit the skeleton of a dinosaur, which
got slightly damaged.  My father made a self-criticism and ensured it
was excavated carefully and shipped to a museum in Peking.  He also
sent soldiers to guard some tombs dating from about ~ zoo from which
the peasants had been taking bricks to improve their pigsties.

One day two peasants were killed by a rock slide.  My father walked
through the night along mountain paths to the scene of the accident.
This was the first time in their lives the local peasants had set eyes
on an official of my father's rank, and they were moved to see that he
was concerned about their well-being.  In the past it had been assumed
that all officials were only out to line their pockets.

After what my father did, the locals thought the Communists were
marvelous.

Meanwhile, one of my mother's main jobs was to galvanize support for
the new government, particularly among factory workers.  From the
beginning of 1951 she had been visiting factories, making speeches,
listening to complaints, and sorting out problems.  Her job included
explaining to the young workers what communism was and encouraging them
to join the Youth League and the Party.  She lived for long periods in
a couple of factories: Communists were supposed to 'live and work among
the workers and peasants," as my father was doing, and to know their
needs.

One factory just outside the city made insulating circuits.

Living conditions there, as in every other factory, were appalling,
with scores of women sleeping in a huge shack built of straw and
bamboo.  The food was woefully inadequate: the workers got meat only
about twice a month, even though they were doing exhausting work.  Many
of the women had to stand in cold water for eight hours at a stretch
washing the porcelain insulators.  Tuberculosis, from malnutrition and
lack of hygiene, was common.  The eating bowls and chopsticks were
never properly washed and were all mixed up together.

In March my mother began to cough up a little blood.

She knew at once that she had TB, but she kept on working.  She was
happy because no one was intruding on her life.  She believed in what
she was doing, and she was excited by the results of her work:
conditions in the factory were improving, the young workers liked her,
and many pledged their allegiance to the Communist cause as the result
of her.  She genuinely felt that the revolution needed her devotion and
self-sacrifice, and she worked flat out, all day, seven days a week.
But after working without a break for months, it became obvious that
she was extremely ill.

Four cavities had developed in her lungs.  By the summer she was also
pregnant with me.

One day in late November my mother fainted on the factory floor.  She
was rushed to a small hospital in the city which had originally been
set up by foreign missionaries.

There she was looked after by Chinese Catholics.  There was still one
European priest there, and a few European nuns, wearing religious
habits.  Mrs.  Ting encouraged my grandmother to bring her food, and my
mother ate an enormous amount- a whole chicken, ten eggs, and a pound
of meat a day sometimes.  As a result, I became gigantic in her womb
and she put on thirty pounds.

The hospital had a small amount of American medicine for TB.  Mrs. Ting
charged in and got hold of the whole lot for my mother.  When my father
found out he asked Mrs.  Ting to take at least half of it back, but she
snapped at him: "What sense does that make?  As it is, this is not
enough for one person.  If you don't believe me, you can go and ask the
doctor.  Besides, your wife works under me and I am making the
decisions about her."  My mother was enormously grateful to Mrs.  Ting
for standing up to my father.  He did not insist.  He was obviously
torn between concern for my mother's health and his principles,
according to which his wife's interest must not override that of the
ordinary people, and at least some of the medicine ought to be saved
for others.

Because of my huge size and the way I grew upward, the cavities in her
lungs were compressed and started to close.  The doctors told her this
was a compliment to her baby, but my mother thought the credit should
probably go to the American medicine she had been able to take, thanks
to Mrs.  Ting.  My mother stayed in the hospital three months, until
February 1952, when she was eight months pregnant.  One day she was
suddenly asked to leave, 'for her own safety."  A friend told her that
some guns had been found in the residence of a foreign priest in
Peking, and all foreign priests and nuns had fallen under extreme
suspicion.

She did not want to leave.  The hospital was set in a pretty garden
with beautiful water lilies, and she found the professional care and
the clean environment, which were rare in China at that time, extremely
soothing.  But she had no choice, and was moved to the Number One
People's Hospital.  The director of this hospital had never delivered a
baby before.  He had been a doctor with the Kuomintang army until his
unit had mutinied and gone over to the Communists.  He was worried that
if my mother died giving birth, he would be in dire trouble because of
his background and because my father was a high official.

Near the date when I was due to appear, the director suggested to my
father that my mother should be moved to a hospital in a larger city,
where there were better facilities and specialist obstetricians.  He
was afraid that when I emerged, the sudden removal of pressure might
cause the cavities in my mother's lung to reopen and produce a
hemorrhage.  But my father refused; he said his wife had to be treated
like anyone else, as the Communists had pledged themselves to combat
privilege.  When my mother heard this she thought bitterly that he
always seemed to act against her interest and that he did not care
whether she lived or died.

I was born on 25 March 1952.  Because of the complexi~' of the case, a
second surgeon was invited in from another hospital.  Several other
doctors were present, along with staff with extra oxygen and blood
transfusion equipment, and Mrs.  Ting.  Chinese men traditionally did
not attend births, but the director asked my father to stand by outside
the delivery room because it was a special case and to protect himself
in case anything went wrong.  It was a very difficult delivery.  When
my head came out, my shoulders, which were unusually broad, got caught.
And I was too fat.

The nurses pulled my head with their hands, and I came out squeezed
blue and purple, and half strangled.  The doctors placed me first in
hot water, then in cold water, and lifted me up by my feet and smacked
me hard.  Eventually I started crying, very loudly, too.  They all
laughed with relief.

I weighed just over ten pounds.  My mother's lungs were undamaged.

A woman doctor picked me up and showed me to my father, whose first
words were: "Oh dear, this child has bulging eyes!"  My mother was very
upset at this remark.

Aunt Jun-ying said, "No, she just has beautiful big eyes!"

As for every occasion and condition in China, there was a particular
dish considered just right for a woman immediately after she had given
birth: poached eggs in raw sugar juice with fermented glutinous rice.
My grandmother prepared these in the hospital, which, like all
hospitals, had kitchens where patients and their families could cook
their own food, and had them ready the minute my mother was able to
eat.

When the news of my birth reached Dr.  Xia, he said:

"All, another wild swan is born."  I was given the name Er-hong, which
means "Second Wild Swan."

Giving me my name was almost the last act in Dr.  Xia's long life. Four
days after I was born he died, at the age of eighty-two.  He was
leaning back in bed drinking a glass of milk.  My grandmother went out
of the room for a minute and when she came back to get the glass she
saw the milk had spilled and the glass had fallen to the floor.  He had
died instantly and painlessly.

Funerals were very important events in China.  Ordinary people would
often bankrupt themselves to lay on a grand ceremony and my grandmother
loved Dr.  Xia and wanted to do him proud.  There were three things she
absolutely insisted on: first, a good coffin; second, that the coffin
must be carried by pallbearers and not pulled on a cart; and third, to
have Buddhist monks to chant the sutras for the dead and musicians to
play the mona, a piercing woodwind ins manent traditionally used at
funerals.  My father agreed to the first and second requests, but
vetoed the third.  The Communists regarded any extravagant ceremony as
wasteful and 'feudal."  Traditionally, only very lowly people were
buried quietly.  Noise-making was considered important at a funeral to
make it a public affair:, this brought 'face' and also showed respect
for the dead.  My father insisted there could be no suona or monks.  My
grandmother had a blazi g row with him.  For her, these were essentials
which she just had to have.  In the mid die of the altercation she
fainted from anger and grief.  She was also wrought up because she was
all alone at the saddest moment of her life.  She had not told my
mother what had happened, for fear of upsetting her, and the fact that
my mother was in the hospital meant that my grandmother had to deal
directly with my father.  After the funeral she had a nervous breakdown
and had to be hospitalized for almost two months.

Dr.  Xia was buried in a cemetery on top of a hill on the edge of
Yibin, overlooking the Yangtze.  His grave was shaded by pines,
cypresses, and camphor trees.  In his short time in Yibin Dr.  Xia had
won the love and respect of all who knew him.  When he died, the
manager of the guesthouse where he had been living arranged
everything

Lh'ing with an Incorruptible Man 237 for my grandmother and led his
staff in the silent tuner al procession.

Dr.  Xia had been happy in his old age.  He loved Yibin and took
tremendous pleasure in all the exotic flowers which flourished in the
subtropical climate, so different from Manchuria.  Right up until the
very end he enjoyed extraordinarily good health.  He had had a good
life in Yibin, with his own house and courtyard rent free; he and my
grandmother were well looked after, with abundant supplies of food
delivered to their home.  It was the dream of every Chinese, in a
society without any social security, to be cared for in old age.  Dr.
Xia was able to enjoy this, and it was no small thing.

Dr.  Xia had got on very well with everybody, including my father, who
respected him enormously as a man of principle.  Dr.  Xia considered my
father a very knowledgeable man.  He used to say he had seen many
officials in the past, but never one like my father.  Common wisdom had
it that 'there is no official who is not corrupt," but my father never
abused his position, not even to look after the interests of his own
family.

The two men would talk together for hours.  They shared many ethical
values, but whereas my father's were dressed in the garb of an
ideology, Dr.  Xia's rested on a humanitarian foundation.  Once Dr. Xia
said to my father: "I think the Communists have done many good things. 
But you have killed too many people.  People who should not have been
killed."

"Like who?"  my father asked.

"Those masters in the Society of Reason," which was the quasi-religious
sect to which Dr.  Xia had belonged.  Its leaders had been executed as
part of the campaign to 'suppress counterrevolution ari  The new regime
suppressed all secret societies, because they commanded loyalties, and
the Communists did not want divided loyalties.

"They were not bad people, and you should have let the Society be," Dr.
Xia said.  There was a long pause.

My father tried to defend the Communists, saying that the struggle with
the Kuomintang was a matter of life and death.

Dr.  Xia could tell that my father was not fully convinced himself, but
felt he had to defend the Party.

When my grandmother left the hospital she came to live with my parents.
My sister and her wet-nurse also moved in.  I shared a room with my
wet-nurse, who had had her own baby twelve days before I was born and
had taken the job because she desperately needed money.  Her husband, a
manual worker, was in jail for gambling and dealing in opium, both of
which had been outlawed by the Communists.  Yibin had been a major
center of the opium trade, with an estimated 25,000 addicts, and opium
had previously circulated as money.  Opium dealing had been closely
linked to gangsters and provided a substantial portion of the
Kuomintang's budget.  Within two years of coming to Yibin the
Communists wiped out opium smoking.

There was no social security or unemployment benefit for someone in the
position of my wet-nurse.  But when she came to us the state paid her
salary, which she sent to her mother-in-law, who was looking after her
baby.  My nurse was a tiny woman with fine skin, unusually big round
eyes, and long exuberant hair, which she kept in a bun.

She was a very kind woman, and treated me like her own daughter.

Traditionally, square shoulders were regarded as unbecoming for girls,
so my shoulders were bound tightly to make them grow into the required
sloppy shape.  This made me bawl so loudly that my nurse would release
my arms and shoulders, allowing me to wave at people who came to the
house, and clutch them, which I liked doing from an early age.  My
mother always attributed my outgoing character to the fact that she was
happy when she was pregnant with me.

We were living in the old landlord's mansion where my father had his
office; it had a big garden with Chinese pepper trees, banana groves,
and lots of sweet-smelling flowers and subtropical plants, which were
looked after by a gardener provided by the government.  My father greys
his own tomatoes and chiles.  He enjoyed this work, but it was also one
of his principles that a Communist official should perform physical
labor, which had traditionally been looked down on by mandarins.

My father was very affectionate to me.  When I began to crawl, he would
lie on his stomach to be my 'mountains," and I would climb up and down
him.

Soon after I was born my father was promoted to become the governor of
the Yibin region, the number-two man in the area, below only the first
secretary of the Party.  (The Party and the government were formally
distinct, but actually inseparable.)

When he had first returned to Yibin, his family and old friends all
expected him to help them.  In China it was assumed that anyone in a
powerful position would look after their relatives.  There was a
well-known saying: "When a man gets power, even his chickens and dogs
rise to heaven."  But my father felt that nepotism and favoritism were
the slippery slope to corruption, which was the root of all the evils
of the old China.  He also knew that the local people were watching him
to see how the Communism would behave, and that what he did would
influence how they regarded communism.

His strictness had already estranged him from his family.

One of his cousins had asked him for a recommendation for a job in the
box office at a local cinema.  My father told him to go through the
official channels.  Such behavior was unheard of, and after this no one
ever asked him for a favor again.  Then something else happened soon
after he was appointed governor.  One of his older brothers was a tea
expert who worked in a tea marketing office.  The economy was doing
well in the early 195os, production was expanding, and the local tea
board wanted to promote him to manager.  All promotions above a certain
level had to be cleared by my father.  When the recommendation landed

24o "When a Man Gets Power..."

on his desk, he vetoed it.  His family was incensed, and so was my
mother.

"It's not you who is promoting him, it's his management!"  she
exploded.

"You don't have to help him, but you don't have to block him either!"
My father said that his brother was not capable enough and that he
would not have been put forward for promotion if he had not been the
governor's brother.  There was a long tradition of anticipating the
wishes of one's superiors, he pointed out.

The tea management board was indignant because my father's action
implied that their recommendation had ulterior motives.  My father
ended up offending everyone, and his brother never spoke to him
again.

But my father was unrepentant.  He was fighting his own crusade against
the old ways, and he insisted on treating everyone by the same
criteria.  But there was no objective standard for fairness, so he
relied on his own instincts, bending over backward to be fair.  He did
not consult his colleagues, partly because he knew that none of them
would ever tell him that a relative of his was undeserving.

His personal moral crusade reached its zenith in 1953 when a civil
service ranking system was instituted.  All officials and government
employees were divided into twenty-six grades.  The pay of the lowest
grade, Grade 26, was one-twentieth of that of the highest grade.  But
the real difference lay in the subsidies and perks.  The system
determined almost everything: from whether one's coat was made of
expensive wool or cheap cotton to the size of one's apariment and
whether it had an indoor toilet or not.

The grading also determined every official's access to information.  A
very important part of the Chinese Communist system was that all
information was not only very tightly controlled, but highly
compatia~tentalized and rationed, not only to the general public who
were told very little but also within the Party.

Although its eventual significance was not apparent, even at the time
civil servants could feel that the grading system was going to be
crucial to their lives, and they were
all nervous about what grade they
would get.  My father, whose grade had already been set at 11 by
higher authorities, was in charge of vetting the rankings proposed for
everyone in the Yibin region.  These included the husband of his
youngest sister, who was his favorite.  He demoted him two grades.  My
mother's department had recommended my mother to be Grade i5; he
relegated her to Grade 17.

This grade system is not directly linked to a person's position in the
civil service.  Individuals could be promoted without necessarily being
upgraded.  In nearly four decades, my mother was upgraded only twice,
in 1962 and 198z; each time she moved up only one grade, and by 199o
she was still Grade z5.  With this ranking, in the 198OS, she was not
entitled to buy a plane ticket or a 'soft seat' on a train: these can
be bought only by officials of Grade z4 and above.  So, thanks to my
father's actions in 1953, almost forty years later she was one rung too
low on the ladder to travel in comfort in her own country.  She could
not stay in a hotel room which had a private bath, as these were for
Grade 13 and above.  When she applied to change the electric meter in
her apartment to one with a larger capacity, the management of the
block told her that only officials of Grade x3 and above were entitled
to a bigger meter.

The very acts which infuriated my father's family were deeply
appreciated by the local population, and his reputation has endured to
this day.  One day in 1952 the headmaster of the Number One Middle
School mentioned to my father that he was having difficulty finding
accommodations for his teachers.

"In that case, take my family's house it's too big for only three
people," my father said instantly, in spite of the fact that the three
people were his mother, his sister Jun-ying, and a brother who was
retarded, and that they all adored the beautiful house with its
enchanted garden.  The school was delighted; his family less so,
although he found them a small house in the middle of town.  His mother
was not too pleased, but being a gracious and understanding woman, she
said nothing.

Not every official was as incorruptible as my father.

Quite soon after taking power, the Communists found themselves facing a
crisis.  They had attracted the support of millions of people by
promising clean government, but some officials began taking bribes or
bestowing favors on their families and friends.  Others threw
extravagant banquets, which is a traditional Chinese indulgence, almost
a disease, and a way of both entertaining and showing of fall at the
expense, and in the name, of the state, at a time when the government
was extremely short of funds; it was trying to reconstruct the
shattered economy and also fight a major war in Korea, which was eating
up about 50 percent of the budget.

Some officials started embezzling on a large scale.  The regime was
worried.  It sensed that the goodwill which had swept it into power and
the discipline and dedication which had ensured its success were
eroding.  In late 195I it decided to launch a movement against
corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.  It was called the "Three Antis
Campaign."  The government executed some corrupt officials, imprisoned
quite a number, and dismissed many others.

Even some veterans of the Communist army who had been involved in
large-scale bribery or embezzlement were executed, to set an example.
Henceforth, corruption was severely punished, and it became rare among
officials for the next couple of decades.

My father was in charge of the campaign in his region.

There were no corrupt senior officials in his area, but he felt it was
important to demonstrate that the Communists were keeping their promise
to provide clean government.

Every official had to make a self-criticism about any infraction,
however minor: for example, if they had used an office telephone to
make a personal call, or a piece of official notepaper to write a
private letter.  Officials became so scrupulous about using state
property that most of them would not even use the ink in their office
to write anything except official communications.  When they switched
from official business to something personal they changed pens.

There was a puritanical zeal about sticking to these prescriptions.  My
father felt that through these minutiae they were creating a new
attitude among the Chinese: public property would, for the first time,
be strictly separate from private; officials would no longer treat the
people's money as their own, or abuse their positions.  Most of the
people who worked with my father took this position, and genuinely
believed that their painstaking efforts were directly linked to the
noble cause of creating a new China.

The Three Antis Campaign was aimed at people in the Party.  But it
takes two to make a corrupt transaction, and the corrupters were often
outside the Party, especially 'capitalists," factory owners and
merchants, who had still hardly been touched.  Old habits were deeply
entrenched.

In spring 1952, soon after the Three Antis Campaign got go' rag
another, overlapping campaign was started.  This was called the "Five
Antis' and was aimed at capitalists.

The five targets were bribery, tax evasion, fraud, theft of state
property, and obtaining economic information through corruption.  Most
capitalists were found to have committed one or more of these offenses,
and the punishment was usually a fine.  The Communists used this
campaign to coax and (more often) cow the capitalists, but in such a
way as to maximize their usefulness to the economy.

Not many were imprisoned.

These two linked campaigns consolidated mechanisms of control,
originally developed in the early days of communism, which were unique
to China.  The most important was the 'mass campaign'
(qiun-zhongyun-dong), which was conducted by bodies known as 'work
teams' (gong-zuo-zu).

Work teams were ad hoc bodies, made up mainly of employees from
government offices and headed by senior Party officials.  The central
government in Peking would send teams to the provinces to vet the
provincial officials and employees.  These, in turn, formed teams which
checked up on the next level, where the process was repeated, all the
way down to the grass roots.  Normally, no one could become a member of
a work team who had not already been vetted in that particular
campaign.

Teams were sent to all organizations where the campaign was to be
conducted 'to mobilize the people."  There were compulsory meefngs most
evenings to study instructions issued by the top authorities.  Team
members would talk, lecture, and try to persuade people to stand up and
expose suspects.  People were encouraged to place anonymous complaints
in boxes provided for the purpose.  The work team would investigate
each case.  If the investigation confirmed the charge, or revealed
grounds for suspicion, the team would formulate a verdict which was
sent up to the next level of authority for approval.

There was no genuine appeal system, although a person who came under
suspicion could ask to see the evidence and would usually be allowed to
make some sort of defense.

Work teams could impose a range of sentences including public
criticism, dismissal from one's job, and various forms of surveillance;
the maximum sentence they could give was to send a person to the
countryside to do physical labor.  Only the most serious cases went to
the formal judicial system, which was under the Party's control.  For
each of the campaigns, a set of guidelines was issued from the very
top, and the work teams had to abide strictly by these.  But when it
came down to individual cases, the judgment and even the temperament-
of the specific work team could also be important.

In each campaign everyone in the category which had been designated as
the target by Peking came under some degree of scrufny, mostly from
their work mates and neighbors rather than the police.  This was a key
invention of

Mao's to involve the entire population in the machinery of control. Few
wrongdoers, according to the regime's criteria, could escape the
watchful eyes of the people,

especially in a society with an age-old concierge mentality-.

But the 'efficiency' was acquired at a tremendous price:

because the campaigns operated on very vague criteria, and because of
personal vendettas, and even gossip, many innocent people were
condemned.

Aunt Jun-ying had been working as a weaver to help support her mother,
her retarded brother, and herself.

Every night she worked into the small hours, and her eyes became quite
badly damaged from the dim light.  By 1952 she had saved and borrowed
enough money to buy two more weaving machines, and had two friends
working with her.  Although they divided the income, in theory my aunt
was paying them because she owned the machines.  In the Five Antis
Campaign anyone employing other people fell under some sort of
suspicion.  Even very small businesses like Aunt Jun-ying's, which were
in effect cooperatives, came under investigation.  She wanted to ask
her friends to leave, but did not want them to feel she was giving them
the sack.  But then the two friends told her it would be best if they
left.  They were worried that if someone else threw mud at her, she
might think it was them.

By the middle of 1953 the Three Antis and Five Antis campaigns had
wound down; the capitalists had been brought to heel, and the
Kuomintang had been eradicated.

Mass meetings were coming to an end, as officials had come to recognize
that much of the information which emerged at them was unreliable.
Cases were being examined on an individual basis.

In May 1953 my mother went into hospital to have her third child, who
was born on 23 May: a boy called Jinming.  It was the missionary
hospital where she had stayed when she was pregnant with me, but the
missionaries had now been expelled, as had happened all over China.  My
mother had just been given a promotion to head of the Public Affairs
Department for the city of Yibin, still working under Mrs.  Ting, who
had risen to be Party secretary for the city.  At the time my
grandmother was also in the hospital with severe asthma.  And so was I,
with a navel infection; my wet-nurse was staying with me in the
hospital.  We were being given good treatment, which was free, as we
belonged to a family 'in the revolution."  Doctors tended to give the
very scarce hospital beds to officials and their families.  There was
no public health service for the majority of the population: peasants,
for example, had to pay.

My sister and my auntJun-ying were staying with friends in the country,
so my father was alone at home.  One day Mrs.  Ting came to report on
her work.  Afterward she said she had a headache and wanted to lie
down.  My father helped her onto one of the beds, and as he did so she
pulled him down toward her and tried to kiss and stroke him.  My father
backed away at once.

"You must be very exhausted," he said, and immediately left the room. A
few moments later he returned, in a very agitated state.  He was
carrying a glass of water which he put on the bedside table.

"You must know that I love my wife," he said, and then, before Mrs.
Ting had a chance to do anything, he went to the door and closed it
behind him.  Under the glass of water he had left a piece of paper with
the words "Communist morality."

A few days later my mother left the hospital.  As she and her baby son
crossed the threshold of the house, my father said: "We're leaving
Yibin the minute we can, for good."

My mother could not imagine what had got into him.  He told her what
had happened, and said Mrs.  Ting had been eyeing him for some time. My
mother was more shocked than angry.

"But why do you want to leave so urgently?"

she asked.

"She's a determined woman," my father said.

"I'm afraid she might try again.  And she is also a vindictive woman.
What I am most worried about is that she might try to harm you.  That
would be easy, because you work under her."

"Is she that bad?"  my mother replied.

"I' did hear some gossip that when she was in jail under the

Kuomintang she seduced the warder, that sort of thing.

But some people like to spread rumors.  Anyway, I'm not surprised she
should fancy you," she smiled.

"But do you think she would really turn nasty on me?  She is my best
friend here."

"You don't understand there is something called "rage out of being
shamed" [nao-xiu-cheng-nu].  I know that is how she is feeling.  I
wasn't very tactful.  I must have shamed her.  I'm sorry.  On the spur
of the moment I acted on impulse, I'm afraid.  She is a woman who will
take revenge."

My mother could visualize exactly how my father might have abruptly
rebuffed Mrs.  Ting.  But she could not imagine Mrs.  Ting would be
that malicious, nor could she see what disaster Mrs.  Ting could bring
down on them.  So my father told her about his predecessor as governor
of Yibin, Mr.  Shu.

Mr.  Shu had been a poor peasant who had joined the Red Army on the
Long March.  He did not like Mrs.  Ting, and criticized her for being
flirtatious.  He also objected to the way she wound her hair into many
6ny plaits, which verged on the outrageous for the 6me.  Several times
he said that she should cut her plaits.  She refused, telling him to
mind his own business, which only made him redouble his criticisms,
making her even more hostile to him.  She decided to take revenge on
him, with the help of her husband.

There was a woman working in Mr.  Shu's office who had been the
concubine of a Kuomintang official who had fled to Taiwan.  She had
been seen trying her charms on Mr.  Shu, who was married, and there was
gossip about them having an affair.  Mrs.  Ting got this woman to sign
a statement saying that Mr.  Shu had made advances to her and had
forced her to have sex with him.  Even though he was the governor, the
woman decided the Tings were more fearsome.  Mr.  Shu was charged with
using his position to have relations with a former Kuomintang
concubine, which was considered inexcusable for a Communist veteran.

A standard technique in China to bring a person down was to draw
together several different charges to make the case appear more
substantial.  The Tings found another 'offense' with which to charge
Mr.  Shu.  He had once disagreed with a policy put forward by Peking
and had written to the top Party leaders stating his views.  According
to the Party charter, this was his right; moreover, as a veteran of the
Long March, he was in a privileged position.  So he felt confident that
he could be quite open with his complaints.  The Tings used this to
claim that he was opposed to the Party.

Stringing the two charges together, Mr.  Ting proposed expelling Mr.
Shu from the Party and sacking him.  Mr.  Shu denied the charges
vigorously.  The first, he said, was simply untrue.  He had never made
a pass at the woman;

all he had done was to be civil to her.  As for the second, he had done
nothing wrong and had no intention of opposing the Party.  The Party
Committee that governed the region was composed of four people: Mr. Shu
himself, Mr.  Ting, my father, and the first secretary.  Now Mr. Shu
was judged by the other three.  My father defended him.  He felt sure
Mr.  Shu was innocent, and he regarded writing the letter as completely
legitimate.

When it came to the vote, my father lost, and Mr.  Shu was dismissed.
The first secretary of the Party supported Mr.  Ting.  One reason he
did so was that Mr.  Shu had been in the 'wrong' branch of the Red
Army.  He had been a senior officer in what was called the Fourth Front
in Sichuan in the early 193OS.  This army had joined forces with the
branch of the Red Army led by Mao on the Long March in 1935.  Its
commander, a flamboyant figure called Zhang Guo-tao, challenged Mao for
the leadership of the Red Army and lost.  He then left the Long March
with his troops.  Eventually, after suffering heavy casualties, he was
forced to rejoin Mao.  But in 1938, after the Communists reached
Yan'an, he went over to the Kuomintang.  Because of this, anyone who
had been in the Fourth Front bore a stigma, and their allegiance to Mao
was considered suspect.  This issue was particularly touchy, as many of
the people in the Fourth Front had come from Sichuan.

After the Communists took power this type of unspoken stigma was
attached to any part of the revolution which Mao had not directly
controlled, including the underground, which included many of the
bravest, most dedicated and best educated Communists.  In Yibin, all
the former members of the underground felt under some sort of pressure.
Among the added complications was the fact that many of the people in
the local underground had come from well-to-do backgrounds, and their
families had suffered at the hands of the Communists.  Moreover,
because they were usually better educated than the people who had
arrived with the Communist army, who were mainly from peasant
backgrounds and often illiterate, they became the object of envy.

Though himself a guerrilla fighter, my father was instinctively much
closer to the underground people.  In any case, he refused to go along
with the insidious ostracism, and spoke out for the former members of
the underground.

"It is ridiculous to divide Communists into "underground" and over
ground he often said.  In fact, most of the people he picked to work
with him had been in the underground, because they were the most
able.

My father thought that to consider Fourth Front men like Mr.  Shu as
suspect was unacceptable, and he fought to have him rehabilitated.
First, he advised him to leave Yibin to avoid further trouble, which he
did, taking his last meal with my family.  He was transferred to
Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, where he was given a job as a
clerk in the Provincial Forestry Bureau.  From there he wrote appeals
to the Central Committee in Peking, naming my father as his reference.
My father wrote supporting his appeal.  Much later, Mr.  Shu was
cleared of 'opposing the Party," but the lesser charge of 'having
extramarital affairs' stood.  The former concubine who had lodged the
accusation dared not retract it, but she gave a patently feeble and
incoherent account of the alleged advances, which was clearly designed
to signal to the investigating group that the accusations were untrue.
Mr.  Shu was given a fairly senior post in the Forestry Ministry in
Peking, but he did not get his old position back.

The point my father was trying to get across to my mother was that the
Tings would stop at nothing to set He old scores.  He gave more
examples and repeated that they had to leave at once.  The very next
day he traveled to Chengdu, one day's journey to the north.  There he
went straight to the governor of the province, whom he knew well, and
asked to be transferred, saying that it was very difficult to work in
his hometown and to cope with the expectations of his many relatives.
He kept his real reasons to himself, as he had no hard evidence about
the Tings.

The governor, Lee Daozhang, was the man who had originally sponsored
the application by Mao's wife, Jiang (~mg, to join the Party.  He
expressed sympathy with my father's position and said he would help him
get a transfer, but he did not want him to move immediately: all the
suitable posts in Chengdu had been filled.  My father said he could not
wait, and would accept anything.  After trying hard to dissuade him,
the governor finally gave up and told him he could have the job of head
of the Arts and Education Office.  But he warned, "This is much below
your ability."  My father said he did not mind as long as there was a
job to do.

My father was so worried that he did not go back to

Yibin at all, but sent a message to my mother telling her to join him
as soon as possible.  The women in his family said it was out of the
question for my mother to move so soon after giving birth, but my
father was terrified about what Mrs.  Ting might do, and as soon as the
traditional month's postnatal convalescence was over, he sent his
bodyguard to Yibin to collect us.

It was decided that my brother Jin-ming would stay behind, as he was
considered too young to travel.  Both his wet-nurse and my sister's
wanted to stay, to be near their families.  Jin-ming's wet-nurse was
very fond of him, and she asked my mother if she could keep him with
her.  My mother agreed.  She had complete confidence in her.

My mother, my grandmother, my sister, and I, with my wet-nurse and the
bodyguard, left Yibin before dawn one night at the end of June.  We all
crammed into a jeep with our meager luggage, just a couple of
suitcases.  At the time, officials like my parents did not own any
property at all only a few articles of basic clothing.  We drove over
potholed dirt roads until we reached the town of Neijiang in the
morning.  It was a sweltering day, and we had to wait there for hours
for the train.

Just as it was finally coming into the station, I suddenly decided I
had to relieve myself and my nurse picked me up and carried me to the
edge of the platform.  My mother was afraid that the train might
suddenly leave and tried to stop her.  My nurse, who had never seen a
train before and had no concept of a timetable, rounded on her and said
rather grandly: "Can't you tell the driver to wait?  Er-hong has to
have a pee."  She thought everyone would, like her, automatically put
my needs first.

Because of our different status, we had to split up when we got on the
train.  My mother was in a second-class sleeper with my sister, my
grandmother had a soft seat in another carriage, and my nurse and I
were in what was called the 'mothers' and children's compartment,"
where she had a hard seat and I had a cot.  The bodyguard was in a
fourth carriage, with a hard seat.

As the train chugged slowly along my mother gazed out at the rice
paddies and sugarcane.  The occasional peasants walking on the mud
ridges seemed to be half asleep under their broad-brimmed straw hats,
the men naked to the waist.  The network of streams flowed haltingly,
obstructed by tiny mud dams which channeled the water into the numerous
individual rice paddies.

My mother was in a pensive mood.  For the second time within four
years, she and her husband and family were having to decamp from a
place to which they were deeply attached.  First from her hometown,
Jinzhou, and now from my father's, Yibin.  The revolution had not, it
seemed, brought a solution to their problems.  Indeed, it had caused
new ones.  For the first time she vaguely reflected on the fact that,
as the revolution was made by human beings, it was burdened with their
failings.  But it did not occur to her that the revolution was doing
very lit He to deal with these failings, and actually relied on some of
them, often the worst.

As the train approached Chengdu in the early afternoon, she found
herself increasingly looking forward to a new life there.  She had
heard a lot about Chengdu, which had been the capital of an ancient
kingdom and was known as 'the City of Silk' after its most famous
product.  It was also called 'the City of Hibiscus," which was said to
bury the city with its petals after a summer storm.  She was twenty two
At the same age, some twenty years before, her mother had been living
as a virtual prisoner in Manchuria in a house belonging to her absent
warlord 'husband," under the watchful eyes of his servants; she was the
plaything and the property of men.  My mother, at least, was an
independent human being.  Whatever her misery, she was sure it bore no
comparison with the plight of her mother as a woman in old China.  She
told herself she had a lot to thank the Communist revolution for.  As
the train pulled into Chengdu station, she was full of determination to
throw herself into the great cause again.

10.  "Suffering Will Make You a

Better Communist' My Mother Falls under Suspicion

~'1953-195d)

My father met us at the station.  The air was motionless and
oppressive, and my mother and my grandmother were exhausted from the
jolting car journey the night before and the burning heat which had
blown through the train all the way.  We were taken to a guesthouse
belonging to the Sichuan provincial government, which was to be our
temporary lodging.  My mother's transfer had happened so quickly that
she had not been assigned a job, and there had been no time to make
proper arrangements about a place for us to live.

Chengdu was the capital of Sichuan, which was the most populous
province in China, with some sixty-five million people then.  It was a
large city, with a population of over half a million, and had been
founded in the fifth century BC.  Marco Polo visited it in the
thirteenth century and was enormously impressed by its prosperity.  It
was laid out on the same plan as Peking, with ancient palaces and major
gates all on a north-south axis which divided the city neatly

254 "Suffering Will Make You a Better Communist' into two parts,
western and eastern.  By 1953 it had outgrown its original neat plan
and was divided into three administrative districts eastern, western,
and the outskirts.

Within a few weeks of arriving my mother was given a job.  My father
was consulted about it, but, in the good' old tradition of China, not
my mother herself.  My father said anything would do, as long as she
was not working directly under him, so she was made head of the Public
Affairs Department for the Eastern District of the city.  As one's work
unit was responsible for one's accommodations, she was assigned rooms
which belonged to her department, in a traditional courtyard.  We moved
into these rooms, while my father stayed on in his office suite.

Our living quarters were in the same compound as the Eastern District
administration.  Government offices were mostly housed in large
mansions which had been confiscated from Kuomintang officials and
wealthy landlords.  All government employees, even senior officials,
lived at their office.  They were not allowed to cook at home, and all
ate in canteens.  The canteen was also where everyone got their boiled
water, which was fetched in thermos flasks.

Saturday was the only day married couples were allowed to spend
together.  Among officials, the euphemism for making love was 'spending
a Saturday."  Gradually, this regimented life-style relaxed a bit and
married couples were able to spend more time together, but almost all
still lived and spent most of their time in their office compounds.

My mother's depariment ran a very broad field of activities, including
primary education, health, entertainment, and sounding out public
opinion.  At the age of twenty-two, my mother was in charge of all
these activities for about a quarter of a million people.  She was so
busy we hardly ever saw her.  The government wanted to establish a
monopoly (known as 'unified purchasing and marketing') over trade in
the basic commodities grain, cotton, edible o'fi, and meat.  The idea
was to get the peasants to sell these exclusively to the government,
which would then ration them out to the urban population and to parts
of the countrx where they were in short supply.

When the Chinese Communist Party launched a new policy, they
accompanied it with a propaganda drive to help put the new policy
across.  It was part of my mother's job to try to convince people that
the change was for the good.

The core of the message this time was that China had a huge population
and that the problem of feeding and clothing it had never been solved;
now the government wanted to make sure the basic necessities were
fairly distributed and that nobody starved while others hoarded grain
or other essentials.  My mother set about her job with gusto, rushing
around on her bicycle, talking at endless meetings every day, even when
she was in the last months of pregnancy with her fourth child.  She
enjoyed her work, and believed in it.

She only went into the hospital at the last minute to have her next
child, a son, who was born on 15 September 1954.

It was a dangerous delivery again.  The doctor was getting ready to go
home when my mother stopped him.  She was bleeding abnormally, and knew
there was something wrong.  She insisted on the doctor staying and
giving her a checkup.  A fragment of her placenta was missing.  Finding
it was considered a major operation, so the doctor had her placed under
a general anesthetic and searched her womb again.  They found the
fragment, which probably saved her life.

My father was in the countryside trying to galvanize support for the
state monopoly program.  He had just been upgraded to Grade 10 and
promoted to deputy director of the Public Affairs Department for the
whole of Sichuan.

One of its major functions was to keep a running check on public
opinion: How did the people feel about a particular policy?  What
complaints did they have?  Since peasants formed the overwhelming
majority of the population, he was often in the countryside finding out
their views and feelings.  Like my mother, he believed passionately in
his work, which was to keep the Party and the government in touch with
the people.

On the seventh day after my mother gave birth, one of his colleagues
sent a car to the hospital to bring her home.

It was accepted that, if the husband was away, the Party organization
was responsible for taking care of his wife.

My mother gratefully accepted the lift, as 'home' was half an hour's
walk away.  When my father came back a few days later, he reprimanded
his colleague.  The rules stipulated that my mother could ride in an
official car only when my father was in it.  Using a car when he was
not there would be seen as nepotism, he said.  My father's colleague
said he had authorized the car because my mother had just been through
a serious operation which had left her extremely weak.  But a rule is a
rule, replied my father.  My mother found it hard to take this
puritanical rigidity once again.  This was the second time my father
had attacked her immediately after a difficult birth.  Why was he not
there to take her home, she asked, so they would not have to break the
rules?  He had been tied up with his work, he said, which was
important.  My mother understood his dedication she was dedicated
herself.  But she was also bitterly disappointed.

Two days after he was born my new brother, Xiao-bei, developed eczema.
My mother thought this was because she had not eaten any boiled green
olives during the summer, when she was too busy working.  The Chinese
believe that olives get rid of body heat that otherwise comes out in
heat bumps.  For several months Xiao-her's hands had to be tied to the
railings of his cot to prevent him from scratching himself.  When he
was six months old he was sent to a dermatology hospital.  At this
point my grandmother had to rush to Jinzhou as her mother was ill.

Xiao-her's nurse was a country girl from Yibin, with luxuriant long
black hair and flirtatious eyes.  She had accidentally killed her own
baby she had been breast-t~eding it lying down, had fallen asleep, and
had smothered it.  She had gone to see my aunt Jun-ying via a family
connection and begged her to give her a recommendation to my family.

She wanted to go to a big city and have fun.  My aunt gave her a
reference, in spite of the opposition of some local women who said she
only wanted to get to Chengdu to be rid of her husband.  Jun-ying,
though unmarried, was far from being jealous of other people's
pleasure, especially sexual pleasure; in fact, she was always delighted
for them.

She was full of understanding and tolerant of human foibles, and quite
un judgmental

Within a few months the nurse was alleged to be having an affair with
an undertaker in the compound.  My parents considered such things
private matters, and turned a blind eye.

When my brother went into the skin hospital, the wet nurse went with
him.  The Communists had largely eliminated venereal disease, but there
were still some VD patients in one of the wards, and one day the
wet-nurse was spotted in bed with a patient in that ward.  The hospital
told my mother and suggested it would be unsafe for the nurse to
continue breast-feeding Xiao-her.  My mother asked her to leave.  After
that, Xiao-her was cared for by my wet-nurse and the wet-nurse who
looked after my other brother, Jin-ming, who had now joined us from
Yibin.

At the end of 1954 Jin-ming's nurse had written to my mother saying she
would like to come and live with us, as she had been having trouble
with her husband, who had become a heavy drinker and was beating her
up.  My mother had not seen Jin-ming for eighteen months, since he was
a month old.  But his arrival was terribly distressing.

For a long time he would not let her touch him, and the only person he
would call "Mother' was his nurse.

My father also found it difficult to strike up a close relationship
with Jin-ming, but he was very close to me.

He would crawl on the floor and let me ride on his back.

Usually he put some flowers in his collar for me to smell.

If he forgot, I would point at the garden and make commanding noises,
indicating that some should be brought instantly.  He would often kiss
me on the cheek.  Once, when he had not shaved, I wrinkled up my face
and complained, "Old beard, old beard!"  at the top of my voice.  I
called him Old Beard (/ao hu-zO for months.  He kissed me more gingerly
after that.  I loved to toddle in and out of offices and play with the
officials.  I used to chase after them and call them by special names I
invented for them, and recite nursery rhymes to them.  Before I was
three I was known as "Little Diplomat."

I think my popularity was really due to the fact that the officials
welcomed a break and a bit of fun, which I provided with my childish
chattiness.  I was very plump, too, and they all liked sitting me on
their laps and pinching and squeezing me.

When I was a little over three years old my siblings and I were all
sent away to different boarding nurseries.  I could not understand why
I was being taken away from home, and kicked and tore the ribbon in my
hair in protest.  In the nursery I deliberately created trouble for the
teachers and used to pour my milk into my desk every day, following it
with my cod-liver-oil capsules.  We had to take a long siesta after
lunch, during which I would tell frightening stories, which I had made
up, to the other children in the big dormitory.  I was soon found out
and punished by being made to sit on the doorstep.

The reason we were in the nurseries was that there was no one to look
after us.  One day in July 1955, my mother and the 800 employees in the
Eastern District were all told they had to stay on the premises until
further notice.  A new political campaign had started this time to
uncover 'hidden counterrevolution ari  Everyone was to be thoroughly
checked.

My mother and her colleagues accepted the order with out question. They
had been leading a regimented life anyway.  Besides, it seemed natural
for the Party to want to check on its members in order to ensure that
the new society was stable.  Like most of her comrades, my mother's
desire to devote herself to the cause overrode any wish to grumble
about the strictness of the measure.

After a week, almost all her colleagues were cleared and allowed to go
out freely.  My mother was one of the few exceptions.  She was told
that certain things in her past were not yet clarified.  She had to
move out of her own bedroom and sleep in a room in a different part of
the office building.  Before that she was allowed a few days at home to
make arrangements for her family as, she was told, she might be
confined for quite a long time.

The new campaign had been triggered by Mao's reaction to the behavior
of some Communist writers, notably the prominent author Hu Feng.  They
did not necessarily disagree with Mao ideologically, but they betrayed
an element of independence and an ability to think for themselves which
he found unacceptable.  He feared that any independent thinking might
lead to less than total obedience to him.  He insisted that the new
China had to act and think as one, and that stringent measures were
needed to hold the country together, or it might disintegrate.  He had
a number of leading writers arrested and labeled them a
'counterrevolutionary conspiracy," a terrifying accusation, as
'counterrevolutionary' activity carried the harshest punishment,
including the death sentence.

This signaled the beginning of the end of individual expression in
China.  All the media had been taken over by the Party when the
Communists came to power.  From now on it was the minds of the entire
nation that were placed under ever tighter control.

Mao asserted that the people he was looking for were 'spies for the
imperialist countries and the Kuomintang, Trotskyists, ex-Kuomintang
officers, and traitors among the Communists."  He claimed that they
were working for a comeback by the Kuomintang and the "US
imperialists," who were refusing to recognize Peking and were
surrounding China with a ring of hostility.  Whereas the earlier
campaign to suppress counterrevolution ari in which my mother's friend
Hui-ge had been executed, had been directed at actual Kuomintang
people, the targets now were people in the Party, or working in the
government, who had Kuomintang connections in their backgrounds.

Compiling detailed files on people's backgrounds had been a crucial
part of the Communists' system of control even before they came to
power.  The files on Party members were kept by the Organization
Deparunent of the Party.  The dossier on anyone working for the state
who was not a Party member was assembled by the authorities in their
work unit and kept by its personnel management.

Every year a report was written about every employee by their boss, and
this was put into their file.  No one was allowed to read their own
file, and only specially authorized people could read other people's.

To be targeted in this new campaign it was enough to have some sort of
Kuomintang connection in one's past, however tenuous or vague.  The
investigations were carried out by work teams made up of officials who
were known to have no Kuomintang connections.  My mother became a prime
suspect.  Our nurses also became targets because of their family
ties.

There was a work team responsible for investigating the servants and
staff of the provincial government- chauffeurs, gardeners, maids,
cooks, and caretakers.  My nurse's husband was in jail for gambling and
smuggling opium, which made her an 'undesirable."  Jin-ming's nurse had
married into a landlord's family and her husband had been a minor
Kuomintang official.  Because wet-nurses were not in positions of
importance, the Party did not delve into their cases very vigorously.
But they had to stop working for our family.

My mother was informed of this when she was home

My Mother Falls under Suspia'on ztI briefly before her detention.  When
she broke the news to the two nurses, they were distraught.  They loved
Jin-ming and me.  My nurse was also worried about losing her income if
she had to go back to Yibin, so my mother wrote to the governor there
asking him to find her a job, which he did.  She went to work on a tea
plantation and was able to take her young daughter to live with her.

Jin-ming's nurse did not want to go back to her husband.

She had acquired a new boyfriend, a caretaker in Chengdu, and wanted to
marry him.  In floods of tears, she begged my mother to help her get a
divorce so she could marry him.  Divorce was exceedingly difficult, but
she knew that a word from my parents, particularly my father, could
assist greatly.  My mother liked the nurse very much and wanted to help
her.  If she could get a divorce and marry the caretaker she would
automatically move from the 'landlord' category into the working class
and then she would not have to leave my family after all.  My mother
talked to my father, but he was against it: "How can you arrange a
divorce?  People would say the Communists were breaking up families."

"But what about our children?"  my mother said.

"Who will look after them if the nurses both have to go?"  My father
had an answer to that, too: "Send them to nurseries."

When my mother told Jin-ming's nurse that she would have to leave, she
almost collapsed.  Jin-ming's first ever memory is of her departure.
One evening at dusk someone carried him to the front door.  His nurse
was standing there, wearing a countrywoman's outfit, a plain top with
cotton butterfly buttons on the side, and carrying a cotton bundle.

He wanted her to take him in her arms, but she stood just out of reach
as he stretched out his hands toward her.

Tears were streaming down her face.  Then she walked down the steps
toward the gate on the far side of the courtyard.  Someone he did not
know was with her.  She was about to pass through the gate when she
stopped and turned around.  He screamed and bawled and kicked, but he
was not carried any nearer.  She stood for a long time framed in the
arch of the courtyard gate, gazing at him.

Then she turned quickly and disappeared.  Jin-ming never saw her
again.

My grandmother was still in Manchuria.  My great grandmother had just
died of tuberculosis.  Before being 'confined to barracks," my mother
had to pack us four children off to nurseries.  Because it was so
sudden, none of the municipal nurseries could take more than one of us,
so we had to be split up among four different institutions.

As my mother was leaving for detention, my father advised her: "Be
completely honest with the Party, and have complete trust in it.  It
will give you the right verdict."

A wave of aversion swept over her.  She wanted something warmer and
more personal.  Still feeling resentful against my father, she reported
one steamy summer day for her second bout of detention this time under
her own Party.

Being under investigation did not in itself carry the stigma of guilt.
It just meant there were things in one's background which had to be
cleared up.  Still, she was grieved to be subjected to such a
humiliating experience after all her sacrifices and her manifest
loyalty to the Communist cause.  But part of her was full of optimism
that the dark cloud of suspicion which had been hanging over her for
almost seven years would finally be swept away forever.

She had nothing to be ashamed of, nothing to hide.  She was a devoted
Communist and she felt sure the Party would recognize this.

A special team of three people was put together to investigate her. The
head of it was a Mr.  Kuang, who was in charge of Public Affairs for
the city of Chengdu, which meant he was below my father and above my
mother.  His family knew my family well.  Now, though he was still
kindly to my mother, his attitude was more formal and reserved.

Like other detainees, my mother was assigned various women 'companions'
who followed her everywhere, even to the toilet, and slept in the same
bed with her.  She was told that this was for her protection.  She
understood implicitly that she was being 'protected' from committing
suicide, or trying to collude with anyone else.

Several women rotated in shifts as her companion.  One of them was
relieved of her duties because she had to go into detention herself to
be investigated.  Each companion had to file a report on my mother
every day.  They were all people my mother knew because they worked in
the district offices, though not in her department.  They were friendly
and, except for the lack of freedom, my mother was treated well.

The interrogators, plus her companion, conducted the sessions like
friendly conversations, although the subject of these conversations was
extremely unpleasant.  The presumption was not exactly of guilt, but it
was not of innocence, either.  And because there were no proper legal
procedures, there was lit He opportunity to defend oneself against
insinuations.

My mother's file contained detailed reports about every stage of her
life as a student working for the underground, in the Women's
Federation in Jinzhou, and at her jobs in Yibin.  These had been
written by her bosses at the time.  The first issue that came up was
her release from prison under the Kuomintang in 1948.  How had her
family been able to get her out, considering that her offense had been
so serious?  She had not even been tortured!  Could the arrest actually
have been a hoax, designed to establish her credentials with the
Communists so that she could worm her way into a trusted position as an
agent for the Kuomintang?

Then there was her friendship with Hui-ge.  It became obvious that her
bosses in the Women's Federation in Jinzhou had put disparaging
comments into her file about this.  Since Hui-ge had been trying to buy
insurance from the Communists through her, they alleged, was she not
perhaps trying to acquire similar insurance from the Kuomintang in case
it won?

The same question was asked about her Kuomintang suitors.  Did she not
encourage them as insurance for herself?  And then back to the same
grave suspicion: Had any of them instructed her to lie low inside the
Communist Party and work for the Kuomintang?

My mother was put in the impossible position of having to prove her
innocence.  All the people she was being asked about either had been
executed or were in Taiwan, or she did not know where.  In any case,
they were Kuomintang people and their word was not going to be trusted.
How can I convince you?  she sometimes thought with exasperation, as
she went over the same incidents again and again.

She was also asked about her uncles' Kuomintang connections, and about
her relationship with every one of her school friends who, as
teenagers, had joined the Kuomintang's Youth League in the period
before the Communists took Jinzhou.  The guidelines for the campaign
classified anyone who had been appointed a branch chief of the
Kuomintang Youth League after the Japanese surrender as a
'counterrevolutionary."  My mother tried to argue that Manchuria was a
special case: the Kuomintang had been seen as representing China, the
motherland, after the Japanese occupation.  Mao himself had been a
senior official in the Kuomintang once, though she did not mention
this.

Besides, her friends had switched their allegiance to the Communists
within a couple of years.  But she was told that these old friends of
hers were now all designated counterrevolution ari  My mother did not
belong to any condemned category, but she was asked the impossible
question: Why was it that you had so many connections with Kuomintang
people?

She was kept in detention for six months.  During this period she had
to attend several mass rallies at which 'enemy agents' were paraded,
denounced, sentenced, handcuffed, and led away to prison amidst
thunderous shouting of slogans and raising of fists by tens of
thousands of people.  There were also counterrevolution ari who had
'confessed' and therefore been given 'lenient punishment which meant
not being sent to prison.  Among these was a friend of my mother's. 
After the rally she committed suicide because, under interrogation, in
despair, she had made a false confession.  Seven years later the Party
acknowledged that she had been innocent all along.

My mother was taken to these rallies 'to receive a lesson."

But, being a strong character, she was not crushed by fear, like so
many, or confused by the deceptive logic and coaxing of the
interrogations.  She kept a clear head and wrote the story of her life
truthfully.

There were long nights when she lay awake, unable to stifle her
bitterness at her unfair treatment.  As she listened to the whining
mosquitoes outside the net over her bed in the airless heat of the
summer, then the autumn rain pattering on the window, and the damp
silence of winter, she chewed over the unfairness of the suspicions
against her particularly the doubts about her arrest by the Kuomintang.
She was proud of the way she had behaved then, and had never dreamed it
would become the reason for her becoming alienated from the
revolution.

But then she began to persuade herself that she should not resent the
Party for trying to maintain its purity.  In China, one was accustomed
to a certain amount of injustice.  Now, at least, it was for a worthy
cause.  She also repeated to herself the Party's words when it demanded
sacrifice from its members: "You are going through a test, and
suffering will make you a better Communist."

She contemplated the possibility of being classified as a
'counterrevolutionary."  If that happened, her children would also be
contaminated, and our entire lives ruined.

The only way she could avoid this would be to divorce my father and
'disown' herself as our mother.  At night, thinking about these grim
prospects, she learned not to shed tears.  She could not even toss and
turn, as her 'companion' was sleeping in the bed with her, and no
matter how friendly they were, they had to report every scrap of
information about how she behaved.  Tears would be interpreted as
meaning she was feeling wounded by the Party or losing confidence in
it.  Both were unacceptable, and could have a negative effect on the
final verdict.

My mother gritted her teeth and told herself to put her faith in the
Party.  Even so, she found it very hard being totally cut off from her
family, and missed her children terribly.  My father did not write or
visit her once letters and meetings were forbidden.  What she needed
more than anything else at the time was a shoulder on which to rest her
head, or at least a loving word.

But she did get phone calls.  From the other end of the line would come
jokes and words of trust which cheered her up enormously.  The only
phone in the whole department was on the desk of the woman who was in
charge of secret documents.  When a call came for my mother, her
'companions' would stand in the room while she was on the line, but
because they liked her and wanted her to get some comfort, they would
show they were not listening.

The woman in charge of secret documents was not part of the team
investigating my mother, so she was not entitled to listen to or report
on her.  My mother's companions made sure that she never got into
trouble for these phone calls.  They would simply report: "Director
Chang telephoned.  Discussed family matters."  Word went around about
what a considerate husband my father was, so concerned about my mother
and so affectionate.  One of my mother's young companions told her she
wanted to find a husband as nice as my father.

No one knew that the caller was not my father, but another high
official who had come over to the Communists from the Kuomintang during
the war against Japan.

Having once been a Kuomintang officer, he had come under suspicion and
had been imprisoned by the Communists in 1947, although he was
eventually cleared.  He cited his experience to reassure my mother, and
in fact remained a lifelong friend of hers.  My father never phoned
once in the six long months.  He knew from his years of being a
Communist that the Party preferred the person under investigation to
have no contact with the outside world, not even with their spouse.  As
he saw it, to comfort my mother would imply some kind of distrust of
the Party.  My mother could never forgive him for deserting her at a
time when she needed love and support more than anything.  Once again
he had proved that he put the Party first.

One January morning, as she was staring at the clumps of shivering
grass being battered by the dismal rain under the jasmine on the
trellis with its masses of intertwined green shoots, my mother was
summoned to see Mr.  Kuang, the head of the investigating team.  He
told her she was being allowed to go back to work and to go out.  But
she had to report in every night.  The Party had not reached a final
conclusion about her.

What had happened, my mother realized, was that the investigations had
bogged down.  Most of the suspicions could not be either proved or
disproved.  Although this was unsatisfactory for her, she pushed it to
the back of her mind in her excitement at the thought of seeing her
children for the first time in six months.

In our different boarding nurseries, we seldom saw our father, either.
He was constantly away in the countryside.

On the rare occasions when he was back in Chengdu, he would send his
bodyguard to bring my sister and me home on Saturdays.  He never had
the two boys fetched because he felt he could not cope with them, they
were too young.

"Home' was his office.  When we got there he would always have to go
off to some meeting, so his bodyguard would lock us up in the office,
where there was nothing to do, apart from competing at blowing soap
bubbles.  Once I got so bored I drank a lot of soapy water and was ill
for days.

When my mother was told she could go out, the first thing she did was
jump on her bicycle and speed off to our nurseries.  She was
particularly worried about Jin-ming, now two and a half, whom she had
hardly had any time to

268 "SuJ]~ring Will Make You a Better Communist' get to know.  But,
after sitting around unused for six months, her bicycle's tires were
flat, and she was barely out of the gate when she had to stop and get
some air put in them.  She had never felt so impatient in her life, as
she paced around the shop while the man pumped up her tires in what
seemed to her a very lackadaisical manner.

She went to see Jin-ming first.  When she arrived, the teacher looked
at her coldly.  Jin-ming, the teacher said, was one of the very few
children who had been left behind on weekends.  My father had hardly
ever come to see him, and had never taken him home.  At first, Jin-ming
had asked for "Mother Chen," the teacher said.

"That's not you, is it?"  she asked.  My mother acknowledged that
"Mother Chen' was his wet-nurse.  Later, Jin-ming would hide in a
corner room when it was time for the other parents to come and collect
their offspring.

"You must be a stepmother," the teacher said accusingly.  My mother
could not explain.

When Jin-ming was brought in, he remained at the far end of the room
and would not go near my mother.  He just stood there silently,
resentfully refusing to look at her.

My mother produced some peaches and asked him to come over and eat them
while she peeled them.  But Jin-ming would not move.  She had to put
the peaches on her handkerchief and push them along the table.  He
waited for her to withdraw her hand before he grabbed one peach and
devoured it.  Then he took another one.  In no time the three peaches
were gone.  For the first time since she had been taken into detention,
my mother let her tears fall.

I remember the evening she came to see me.  I was nearly four, and was
in my wooden bed which had bars like a cage.  One side of the railing
was let down so she could sit and hold my hand while I fell asleep. But
I wanted to tell her about all my adventures and mischief.  I was
worried that once I fell asleep she would disappear again forever.

Whenever she thought I was asleep and tried to slip her hand away, I
gripped it and started to cry.  She stayed until around midnight.  I
screamed when she started to leave, but she pulled herself away.  I did
not know that 'parole' time was up.

11.  "After the Anti-Rightist Campaign No One Opens Their Mouth' w

China Silenced

(7 956- 7958)

Because we now had no nurses and my mother had to check in for her
'parole' report every evening, we children had to stay on in our
nurseries.  My mother could not have looked after us anyway.  She was
too busy 'racing toward socialism' as a propaganda song went with the
rest of Chinese society.

While she had been in detention Mao had accelerated his attempt to
change the face of China.  In July 1955 he had called for a speeding up
of collective farming, and in November he abruptly announced that all
industry and commerce, which had so far remained in private hands, were
to be nationalized.

My mother was thrown straight into this movement.  In theory, the state
was supposed to own enterprises join fly with the former owners, who
were to draw 5 percent of the value of their business for twenty years.
Since there was officially no inflation, this was supposed to
represent

?

5!

full payment of the total value.  The former owners were to stay on as
managers and be paid a relatively high wage, but there would be a Party
boss over them.

My mother was put in charge of a work team supervising the
nationalization of over a hundred food factories, bakeries, and
restaurants in her district.  Although she was still on 'parole," and
had to report in every evening, and could not even sleep in her own
bed, she was entrusted with this important job.

The Party had attached astigmatic label to her kongzhi shi-yong, which
meant 'employed but under control and surveillance."  This was not made
public, but was known to her and the people in charge of her case.  The
members of her work team knew she had been detained for six months, but
did not know she was still under surveillance.

When my mother was put in detention, she had written to my grandmother
asking her to stay on in Manchuria for the time being.  She had
concocted an excuse, as she did not want my grandmother to know she was
being detained, which would have worried her terribly.

My grandmother was still in Jinzhou when the nationalization program
started, and she found herself caught up in it.  After she had left
Jinzhou with Dr.  Xia in 195I his medicine business had been run by her
brother, Yu-lin.

When Dr.  Xia died in 1952 ownership of the medicine shop passed to
her.  Now the state was planning to buy it out.  In every business a
group, made up of work team members and representatives of both
employees and management, was set up to value its assets so the state
could pay a 'fair price."  They would often suggest a very low figure
to please the authorities.  The value placed on Dr.  Xia's shop was
ridiculously low, but there was an advantage to this for my
grandmother: it meant that she was classified only as a 'minor
capitalist," which made it easier for her to keep a low profile.  She
was not happy about being quasi-expropriated, but she kept her own
counsel.

272 The the Anti-Rightist Campaign..."

As part of the nationalization campaign, the regime organized
processions with drums and gongs and endless meetings, some of them for
the capitalists.  My grandmother saw that all of them were expressing
willingness to be bought out, even gratitude.  Many said that what was
happening to them was much better than they had feared.

In the Soviet Union, they had heard, businesses were confiscated
outright.  Here in China the owners were being indemnified, and what
was more, the state did not just order them to hand over their
businesses.  They had to be willing.  Of course, everyone was.

My grandmother was confused about how she should feel resentful toward
the cause her daughter was engaged in, or happy with her lot, as she
was told she should be.

The medicine business had been built up by Dr.  Xia's hard work, and
her livelihood and that of her daughter had depended on it.  She was
reluctant to see it go just like that.

Four years earlier, during the Korean War, the government had
encouraged people to donate their valuables to help buy fighter planes.
My grandmother did not want to give up her jewelry, which had been
given to her by General Xue and Dr.  Xia, and had at times been her
only source of income.  It also had strong sentimental value.  But my
mother added her voice to that of the government.  She felt that
jewelry was connected with an outdated past, and shared the Party's
view that it was the fruit of 'the exploitation of the people' and
should therefore be returned to them.  She also produced the standard
line about protecting China from being invaded by the "US
imperialists," which did not mean very much to my grandmother.  Her
clinching arguments were: "Mother, what do you still want these things
for?  Nobody wears this sort of thing nowadays.  And you don't have to
rely on them to live.  Now that we have the Communist Party, China is
no longer going to be poor.

What have you got to be worried about?  In any case, you have me.  I
will look after you.  You never have to worry again.  I have to
persuade other people to donate.  It's part jj of my work.  How can I
ask them if my own mother doesn't do it?"  My grandmother gave up.  She
would do anything for her daughter.  She surrendered all her jewelry
except a couple of bracelets, a pair of gold earrings, and a gold ring,
which were wedding presents from Dr.  Xia.  She got a receipt from the
government and much praise for her 'patriotic zeal."

But she was never happy about losing her jewelry, though she hid her
feelings.  Apart from sentimental attachment, there was a very
practical consideration.  My grandmother had lived through constant
insecurity.  Could one really trust the Communist Party to look after
everyone?

Forever?

Now, four years later, she was again in the situation of having to hand
over to the state something she wanted to keep, in fact the last
possession she had.  This time, she did not really have any choice. But
she was also positively cooperative.  She did not want to let her
daughter down, and wanted to make sure her daughter would not be even
slightly embarrassed by her.

The nationalization of the shop was a long process, and my grandmother
stayed on in Manchuria while it dragged on.  My mother did not want her
to come back to Sichuan anyway until she herself had her full freedom
of movement restored and was able to live in her own quarters.  It was
not until summer 1956 that my mother recovered freedom of movement and
the 'parole' restrictions were lifted.  However, even then there was no
definitive decision on her case.

It was finally brought to a conclusion at the end of that year.  The
verdict, which was issued by the Chengdu Party authorities, said in
effect that they believed her account, and that she had no political
connection with the Kuomintang.  This was a clear-cut decision which
exonerated her completely.  She was tremendously relieved, as she knew
her case could well have been left open 'for lack of satisfactory
evidence," like many other similar cases.  Then a stigma

would have stuck with her for life.  Now the chapter was closed, she
thought.  She was very grateful to the chief of the investigation team,
Mr.  Kuang.  Usually officials tended to err on the side of
overzealousness in order to protect themselves.  It needed courage on
the part of Mr.  Kuang to decide to accept what she had said.

After eighteen months of intense anxiety, my mother was in the clear
again.  She was lucky.  As a result of the campaign over I6O'OOO men
and women were labeled counterrevolution ari and their lives were
ruined for three decades.  Among these were some of my mother's friends
in Jinzhou who had been the Kuomintang Youth League cadres.  They were
summarily branded counterrevolution ari sacked from their jobs, and
sent to do manual labor.

This campaign to root out the last vestiges of the Kuomintang past
pushed family background and connections to the forefront.  Throughout
Chinese history, when one person was condemned sometimes the entire
clan men, women, and children, even newborn babies was executed.
Execution could extend to cousins nine times removed (zhu-lian
jill-zu). Someone being accused of a crime could endanger the lives of
a whole neighborhood.

Hitherto the Communists had included people with 'undesirable'
backgrounds in their ranks.  Many sons and daughters of their enemies
rose to high positions.  In fact, most early Communist leaders had come
from 'bad' backgrounds themselves.  But after 1955 family origins
became increasingly important.  As the years went by and Mao launched
one witch-hunt after another, the number of victims snowballed, and
each victim brought down many others, including, first and foremost,
his or her immediate family.

In spite of these personal tragedies, or perhaps partly because of the
steely control, China was more stable in 1956 than at any time this
century.  Foreign occupation, civil war, widespread death from
starvation, bandits,

inflation all seemed to be things of the past.  Stability, the dream of
the Chinese, sustained the faith of people like my mother in their
sufferings.

In the summer of 1956 my grandmother returned to Chengdu.  The first
thing she did was to rush to the nurseries and take us back to my
mother's place.  My grandmother had a fundamental dislike of nurseries.
She said children could not be properly looked after in a group.  My
sister and I looked all right, but as soon as we spotted her, we
screamed and demanded to go home.  The two boys were another matter:
Jin-ming's teacher complained that he was terribly withdrawn, and would
not let any adult touch him.  He only asked, quietly but obstinately,
for his old nurse.  My grandmother burst into tears when she saw
Xiao-her.  He looked like a wooden puppet, with a meaningless grin on
his face.  Wherever he was put, whether sitting or standing, he would
just remain there, motionless.

He did not know how to ask to go to the lavatory, and did not even seem
to be able to cry.  My grandmother swept him up into her arms and he
instantly became her favorite.

Back at my mother's apartment, my grandmother gave vent to her anger
and incomprehension.  In between her tears she called my father and my
mother 'heartless parents."  She did not know that my mother had no
choice.

Because my grandmother could not look after all four of us, the two
older ones, my sister and I, had to go to a nursery during the week.
Every Monday morning, my father and his bodyguard would lift us onto
their shoulders and carry us off howling, kicking, and tearing their
hair.

This went on for some time.  Then, subconsciously, I developed a way of
protesting.  I began to fall ill at the nursery, with high fevers which
alarmed the doctors.  As soon as I was back home, my illness
miraculously evaporated.

Eventually, my sister and I were allowed to stay at home.

For my grandmother, all flowers and trees, the clouds and the rain were
living beings with a heart and tears and a moral sense.  We would be
safe if we followed the old Chinese rule for children, ting-hua
('heeding the words," being obedient).  Otherwise all sorts of things
would happen to us.  When we ate oranges my grandmother would warn us
against swallowing the seeds.

"If you don't listen to me, one day you won't be able to get into the
house.

Every little seed is a baby orange tree, and he wants to grow up, just
like you.  He'll grow quietly inside your turn roy up and up, and then
one day, Ai-ya!  There he is, out from the top of your head!  He'll
grow leaves, and bear more oranges, and he'll become taller than our
door..."

The thought of carrying an orange tree on my head fascinated me so much
that one day I deliberately swallowed a seed one, no more.  I did not
want an orchard on my head: that would be too heavy.  For the whole
day, I anxiously felt my skull every other minute to see whether it was
still in one piece.  Several times I almost asked my grandmother
whether I would be allowed to eat the oranges on my head, but I checked
myself so that she would not know I had been disobedient.  I decided to
pretend it was an accident when she saw the tree.  I slept very badly
that night.  I felt something was pushing up against my skull.

But usually my grandmother's stories sent me happily to sleep.  She had
a wealth of them from classical Chinese opera.  We also had a lot of
books about animals and birds and myths and fairy tales.  We had
foreign children's stories, too, including Hans Christian Andersen and
Aesop's fables.  Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White and the Seven
Dwarfi, and Cinderella were among my childhood companions.

Along with the stories, I loved nursery rhymes.  They were my earliest
encounters with poetry.  Because the Chinese language is based on
tones, its poetry has a particularly musical quality to it.  I was
mesmerized by my grandmother's chanting of classical poems, whose
meaning I did not understand.  She read them in traditional style,
producing singsong, lingering sounds, rising and falling

!(,

in cadence.  One day my mother overheard her reciting to us some poems
written in about 500 BC.  My mother thought they were far too difficult
for us and tried to stop her.  But my grandmother insisted, saying we
did not have to understand the meaning, just get the feel for the
musicality of the sounds.  She often said she regretted losing her
zither when she left Yixian twenty years before.

My two brothers were not so interested in bedtime stories, or in being
read to.  But my sister, who shared a room with me, was just like me:
she loved these stories.

And she had an extraordinary memory.  She had impressed everyone by
reciting Pushkin's long ballad "The Fisherman and the Goldfish'
flawlessly at the age of three.

My family life was tranquil and loving.  Whatever resentment my mother
felt for my father, she seldom had rows with him, at least not in front
of the children.  My father's love for us was rarely shown through
physical contact now that we were older.  It was not customary for a
father to hold his children in his arms, or to show affection by
kissing them or embracing them.  He would often give the boys piggyback
rides, and would pat their shoulders or stroke their hair, which he
rarely did to us girls.  When we got beyond the age of three he would
lift us carefully with his hands under our armpits, strictly adhering
to Chinese convention, which prescribed avoiding intimacy with one's
daughters.  He would not come into the room where my sister and I slept
without our permission.

My mother did not have as much physical contact with us as she would
have liked.  This was because she fell under another set of rules:
those of the Communists' puritanical life-style.  In the early 195os, a
Communist was supposed to give herself so completely to the revolution
and the people that any demonstration of affection for her children was
frowned on as a sign of divided loyalties.  Every single hour apart
from eating or sleeping belonged to the revolution, and was supposed to
be spent working.  Anything that was regarded as not to do with the
revolution, like carrying your children in your arms, had to be
dispatched as speedily as possible.

At first, my mother found this hard to get used to.

"Putting family first' was a criticism constantly leveled at her by her
Party colleagues.  Eventually, she became drilled into the habit of
working nonstop.  By the time she came home in the evening, we had long
since gone to sleep.  She would sit by our bedsides watching our faces
as we slept and listening to our peaceful breathing.  It was the
happiest moment in her day.

Whenever she had time she would cuddle us, gently scratching or
tickling us, especially on our elbows, which was intensely pleasurable.
Pure heaven for me was putting my head on her lap and having the inside
of my ears tickled.

Ear-picking was a traditional form of pleasure for the Chinese.  As a
child, I remember seeing professionals carrying a stand with a bamboo
chair on one end and scores of tiny fluffy picks dangling from the
other.

Starting in 1956 officials started to have Sundays off.

My parents would take us to parks and playgrounds where we played on
the swings and merry-go-rounds or rolled down the grass-covered slopes.
I have a memory of somersaulting dangerously but thrillingly downhill,
meaning to career into my parents' arms, but instead crashing into two
hibiscus trees, one after the other.

My grandmother was still appalled at how often my parents were
absent.

"What sort of parents are these?"  she would sigh, shaking her head. To
make up for them, she gave all her heart and energy to us.  But she
could not cope with four children on her own, so my mother invited Aunt
Jun-ying to come and live with us.  She and my grandmother got on very
well, and this harmony continued when they were joined in early 1957 by
a live-in maid.  This coincided with our move to new quarters, in a
former Christian vicarage.  My father came with us, and so, for the
first time ever, the whole family was living together under one roof.

The maid was eighteen.  When she first arrived she was wearing a
flower-patterned cotton top and slacks, which city dwellers, who wore
quiet colors in keeping with both urban snobbery and Communist
puritanism, would have regarded as rather garish.  City ladies also had
their clothes cut like Russian women's, but our maid wore traditional
peasant-style garb, buttoned at the side, with cotton buttons instead
of the new plastic ones.  Instead of a belt, she used a cotton string
to tie up her trousers.  Many peasant women coming to town would have
changed their attire so as not to look like country bumpkins.  But she
was completely unselfconscious about her clothes, which showed her
strength of character.  She had big, rough hands and a shy, honest
smile on her dark, suntanned face, with two permanent dimples in her
rosy cheeks.  Everyone in our family liked her immediately.  She ate
with us and did the housework with my grandmother and my aunt.  My
grandmother was delighted to have two close friends and confidantes, as
my mother was never there.

Our maid came from a landlord's family, and had been desperate to get
away from the countryside and the constant discrimination she faced
there.  In 1957 it had again become possible to employ people from a
'bad' family background.  The 1955 campaign was over, and the
atmosphere was generally more relaxed.

The Communists had instituted a system under which everyone had to
register their place of residence (hu-kou).

Only those registered as urban dwellers were entitled to food rations.
Our maid had a country registration so she had no source of food when
she was with us, but the rations for my family were more than enough to
feed her too.  One year later, my mother helped her to move her
registration into Chengdu.

My family also paid her wages.  The system of state allowances had been
abolished in late 1956, when my father also lost his bodyguard, who was
replaced by a shared manservant who did chores for him in his office,

like serving him tea and arranging cars.  My parents were now earning
salaries fixed according to their civil service grades.  My mother was
Grade i7, and my father was Grade io, which meant he earned twice as
much as she did.  Because basics were cheap, and there was no concept
of a consumer society, their combined income was more than adequate. My
father was a member of a special category known as gas-gan, 'high
officials," a term applied to people of Grade: 3 and above, of whom
there were about zoo in Sichuan.  There were fewer than twenty people
of Grade xo and above in the whole province, which had a population of
about seventy-two million now.

In the spring of 1956 Mao announced a policy known as the Hundred
Flowers, from the phrase 'let a hundred flowers bloom' (bai-hua
qi-j~ng), which in theory meant greater freedom for the arts,
literature, and scientific research.  The Party wanted to enlist the
support of China's educated citizens, which the country needed, as it
was entering a stage of 'post-recovery' industrialization.

The general educational level of the country had always been very low.
The population was huge over 600 million by then and the vast majority
had never enjoyed anything like a decent standard of living.  The
country had always had a dictatorship which operated by keeping the
public ignorant and thus obedient.  There was also the problem of the
language: the Chinese script is exceedingly difficult;

it is based on tens of thousands of individual characters which are not
related to sounds, and each has complicated strokes and needs to be
remembered separately.  Hundreds of millions of people were completely
illiterate.

Anybody with any education at all was referred to as an 'intellectual."
Under the Communists, who based their policies on class categories,
'intellectuals' became a specific, if vague, category, which included
nurses, students, and actors as well as engineers, technicians,
writers, teachers, doctors, and scientists.

Under the Hundred Flowers policy, the country enjoyed

China Silenced 28 i about a year of relative relaxation.  Then, in
spring 1957, the Party urged intellectuals to criticize officials all
the way to the top.  My mother thought this was to encourage further
liberalization.  After a speech by Mao on the subject, which was
gradually relayed down to her level, she was so moved she could not
sleep all night.  She felt that China was really going to have a modern
and democratic party, a party that would welcome criticism to
revitalize itself.  She felt proud of being a Communist.

When my mother's level was told about Mao's speech soliciting criticism
of officers, they were not informed about some other remarks he had
made around the same time, about enticing snakes out of their lairs to
uncover anyone who dared to oppose him or his regime.  One year before,
the Soviet leader, Khrushchev, had denounced Stalin in his 'secret
speech," and this had devastated Mao, who identified himself with
Stalin.  Mao was further rat fled by the Hungarian uprising that
autumn, the first successful if short-lived attempt to overthrow an
established Communist regime.  Mao knew that a large proportion of
China's educated people favored moderation and liberalization.  He
wanted to prevent a "Chinese Hungarian uprising."  In fact, he
effectively told the Hungarian leaders that his solicitation of
criticism had been a trap, which he had prolonged after his colleagues
suggested bringing it to a halt, in order to make sure he had smoked
out every single potential dissident.

He was not worried about the workers or the peasants, as he was
confident they were grateful to the Communists for bringing them full
stomachs and stable lives.  He also had a fundamental contempt for them
he did not believe they had the mental capacity to challenge his rule.
But Mao had always distrusted intellectuals.  They had played a big
role in Hungary, and were more likely than others to think for
themselves.

Unaware of Mao's secret maneuvers, officials and intellectuals alike
engaged in soliciting and offering criticisms.

282 5qfier the Anti-Rightist Campaign..."

According to Mao, they were to 'say whatever they want to say, and to
the full."  My mother enthusiastically repeated this in the schools,
hospitals, and entertainment groups she looked after.  All kinds of
opinions were aired at organized seminars and on wall posters.
Well-known people set an example by making criticisms in the
newspapers.

My mother, like almost everyone, came in for some criticism.  The main
one from the schools was that she showed favoritism toward 'key'
(zhong-dian) schools.  In China there were a number of officially
designated schools and universities on which the state concentrated its
limited resources.  These got better teachers and facilities, and
selected the brightest pupils, which guaranteed that they had a high
entrance rate into institutions of higher education, especially the
'key' universities.  Some teachers from ordinary schools complained
that my mother had been paying too much attention to the 'key' schools
at their expense.

Teachers were also graded.  Good teachers were given honorary grades
which entitled them to much higher salaries, special food supplies when
there was a shortage, better housing, and complimentary theater
tickets.  Most graded teachers under my mother seemed to have come from
'undesirable' family backgrounds, and some of the ungraded teachers
complained that my mother placed too much importance on professional
merit rather than 'class background."  My mother made self-criticisms
about her lack of even handedness regarding the 'key' schools, but she
insisted that she was not wrong in using professional merit as the
criterion for promotion.

There was one criticism to which my mother turned a deaf ear in
disgust.  The headmistress of one primary school had joined the
Communists in 1945 earlier than my mother and was unhappy at having to
take orders from her.  This woman attacked my mother on the grounds
that she had got her job solely on the strength of my father's
statuS.

There were other complaints: the headmasters wanted the right to choose
their own teachers, instead of having them assigned by a higher
authority.  Hospital directors wanted to be able to buy herbs and other
medicines themselves, because the state supply did not meet their
needs.

Surgeons wanted larger food rations: they considered their job to be as
demanding as that of a kung-fu player in a traditional opera, but their
ration was a quarter less.  A junior official lamented the
disappearance from Chengdu markets of some famous traditional items
like "Pockmark Wong scissors' and "Beards Hu brushes," which had been
replaced by inferior mass-produced substitutes.  My mother agreed with
many of these views, but there was nothing she could do about them, as
they involved state policies.  All she could do was report them to
higher authorities.

The outburst of criticisms, which were often personal grouses or
practical, nonpolitical suggestions for improvements, blossomed for
about a month in the early summer of 1957.  At the beginning of June,
Mao's speech about 'enticing snakes out of their lairs' was relayed
down orally to my mother's level.

In this talk, Mao said that 'rightists' had gone on a rampage attacking
the Communist Party and China's socialist system.  He said these
rightists made up between 1 percent and 10 percent of all
intellectuals and that they must be smashed.  To simplify things, a
figure of 5 percent, halfway between Mao's two extremes, had been
established as the quota for the number of rightists who had to be
caught.  To meet it, my mother was expected to find over a hundred
rightists in the organizations under her.

She had not been very happy about some of the criticisms made to her.
But few of them could even remotely be considered 'anti-Communist' or
'anti-socialist."  Judging from what she had read in the newspapers, it
seemed there had been some attacks on the Communists' monopoly of power
and on the socialist system.  But in her schools and a84 ~lfier the
Anti-Rightist Campaign..."

hospitals, there were no such grand calls.  Where on earth could she
find the rightsts?

Besides, she thought, it was unfair to penalize people who had spoken
up after they had been invited, indeed urged, to do so.  Moreover, Mao
had explicitly guaranteed that there would be no reprisals for speaking
up.  She herself had called enthusiastically on people to voice their
criticisms.

Her dilemma was typical of that facing millions of officials across
China.  In Chengdu, the Anti-Rightist Campaign had a slow and painful
start.  The provincial authorities decided to make an example of one
man, a Mr.  Hau, who was the Party secretary of a research institute
staffed by top scientists from all over Sichuan.  He was expected to
catch a considerable number of rightists, but he reported that there
was not a single one in his institute.

"How is that possible?"  his boss said.  Some of the scientists had
studied abroad, in the West.

"They must have been contaminated by Western society.  How can you
expect them to be happy under communism?  How can there be no rightists
among them?"  Mr.  Hau said that the fact that they were in China by
choice proved they were not opposed to the Communists, and went so far
as to give a personal guarantee for them.  He was warned several times
to mend his ways.  In the end he was declared a rightist himself,
expelled from the Party, and sacked from his job.  His civil service
grade was drastically reduced, which meant his salary was slashed, and
he was put to work sweeping the floors of the laboratories in the
institute he had formerly been running.

My mother knew Mr.  Hau, and admired him for sticking to his guns.  She
developed a great friendship with him which has lasted till today.  She
spent many evenings with him, giving vent to her anxieties.  But in his
fate she saw her own if she did not fill her quota.

Every day, after the usual endless meetings, my mother had to report to
the municipal Party authorities on how the campaign was going.  The
person in charge of the campaign i,

China Silenced z85 in Chengdu was a Mr.  Ying, a lean, tall, rather
arrogant man.  My mother was supposed to produce figures for him
showing how many rightists had been nailed.  There did not have to be
any names.  It was numbers that mattered.

But where could she find her ioo-plus 'antiCommunist, anti-socialist
rightists'?  Eventually one of her deputies, a Mr.  Kong, who was in
charge of education for the Eastern District, announced that the
headmistresses of a couple of schools had identified some teachers in
their schools.  One was a teacher in a primary school whose husband, a
Kuomintang officer, had been killed in the civil war.  She had said
something to the effect that "China today is worse off than in the
past."  One day she got into a row with the headmistress, who had
criticized her for slacking off.  She flew into a rage and hit the
headmistress.  A couple of her teachers tried to stop her, one telling
her to be careful because the headmistress was pregnant.  She was
reported to have screamed that she wanted to 'get rid of that Communist
bastard' (meaning the baby in the woman's womb).

In another case, a teacher whose husband had fled to Taiwan with the
Kuomintang was reported to have shown off to other young women teachers
some jewelry her husband had given her, trying to make them envious of
her life under the Kuomintang.  These young women also said she told
them it was a pity the Americans had not won the war in Korea and
advanced into China.

Mr.  Kong said he had checked the facts.  It was not up to my mother to
investigate.  Caution would be seen as trying to protect the rightists
and questioning her colleagues' integrity.

The hospital chiefs and the deputy who was running the health bureau
did not name any rightists themselves, but several doctors were labeled
rightists by the higher authorities of the Chengdu municipality for
their criticisms made at earlier meetings organized by the city
authorities.

All these rightists together came to fewer than ten, far short of the
quota.  By now Mr.  Ying was fed up with the lack of zeal displayed by
my mother and her colleagues, and he told her that the fact that she
could not spot rightism showed she was 'rightist material' herself.  To
be labeled a rightist not only meant becoming a political outcast and
losing one's job, but, most important, one's children and family would
suffer discrimination and their future would be in jeopardy.  The
children would be ostracized at school and in the street where they
lived.  The residents' committee would spy on the family to see who was
visiting them.

If a rightist was sent to the countryside, the peasants would give the
hardest jobs to him and his family.  But no one knew the exact impact,
and this uncertainty was itself a powerful cause of fear.

This was the dilemma facing my mother.  If she was labeled a rightist,
she would either have to renounce her children or ruin their future. My
father would probably be forced to divorce her, or he too would be
blacklisted and under permanent suspicion.  Even if my mother
sacrificed herself and divorced him, the whole family would still be
marked as suspects, forever.  But the cost of saving herself and her
family was the well-being of more than a hundred innocent people and
their families.

My mother did not talk to my father about this.  What solution could he
have come up with?  She felt resentful because his high position meant
he did not have to deal with specific cases.  It was the lower- and
middle-rank officials like Mr.  Ying, my mother, her deputies, the
headmistresses, and hospital directors who had to make these agonizing
decisions.

One of the institutions in my mother's district was the Chengdu Number
Two Teacher Training College.  Students in teacher training colleges
were given scholarships which covered their fees and living expenses,
and these institutions naturally attracted people from poor families.

The first railway linking Sichuan, "Heaven's Granary," with the rest of
China had recently been completed.  As a result,

?

a lot of food was suddenly transported out of Sichuan to other parts of
China, and the prices of many items doubled or even tripled almost
overnight.  The students at the college found their standard of living
practically halved, and staged a demonstration calling for higher
grants.  This action was compared by Mr.  Ying to those of the Pettfi
Circle in the 1956 Hungarian uprising, and he called the students
'kindred spirits of the Hungarian intellectuals."

He ordered that every student who had participated in the demonstration
should be classified as a rightist.  There were about 300 students at
the college, of whom ~ 30 had taken part in the demonstration.  All of
them were labeled rightists by Mr.  Ying.  Although the college was not
under my mother, as she looked after primary schools only, it was
located in her district, and the city authorities arbitrarily counted
the students as her quota.

My mother was not forgiven for her lack of initiative.

Mr.  Ying put her name down for further investigation as a rightist
suspect.  But before he could do anything, he was condemned as a
rightist himself.

In March 1957 he had gone to Peking for a conference of the heads of
provincial and municipal Public Affairs departments from the whole of
China.  In the group discussions, delegates were encouraged to voice
their complaints about the way things were run in their areas.  Mr.
Ying aired some fairly innocuous grumbles against the first secretary
of the Sichuan Party Committee, Li Jing-quan, who was always known as
Commissar Li.  My father was the head of the Sichuan delegation at the
conference, so it fell to him to write the routine report when they
came back.  When the Anti-Rightist Campaign started, Commissar Li
decided he did not like what Mr.  Ying had said.  He checked with the
deputy head of the delegation, but this man had adroitly absented
himself in the toilet when Mr.  Ying started his criticism.  In the
later stage of the campaign, Commissar Li labeled Mr.  Ying a rightist.
When he heard this, my father became desperately upset, tormenting
himself with the thought that he was partly responsible for Mr.  Ying's
downfall.  My mother tried to convince him this was not the case: "It's
not your fault!"  she told him.  But he never stopped agonizing about
it.

Many officials used the campaign to settle personal scores.  Some found
that one easy way to fill their quota was to offer up their enemies.
Others acted out of sheer vindictiveness.  In Yibin, the Tings purged
many talented people with whom they did not get on, or of whom they
were jealous.  Almost all of my father's assistants there, whom he had
picked out and promoted, were condemned as rightists.  One former
assistant whom my father liked very much was branded an 'extreme
rightist."  His crime was a single remark to the effect that China's
reliance on the Soviet Union should not be 'absolute."  At the time the
Party was proclaiming that it should be.  He was sentenced to three
years in one of China's gnlags and worked on building a road in a wild,
mountainous area, where many of his fellow prisoners died.

The Anti-Rightist Campaign did not affect society at large.  Peasants
and workers carried on with their lives.

When the campaign ended after a year, at least 55o,000 people had been
labeled as rightists students, teachers, writers, artists, scientists,
and other professionals.  Most of them were sacked from their jobs and
became manual laborers in factories or on farms.  Some were sent to do
hard labor in gnlags.  They and their families became second-class
citizens.  The lesson was harsh and clear:

criticism of any kind was not going to be tolerated.  From that point
on people stopped complaining, or speaking up at all.  A popular saying
summed up the atmosphere: "After the Three Antis no one wants to be in
charge of money;

after the Anti-Rightist Campaign no one opens their mouth."

But the tragedy of 1957 was more than that of reducing people to
silence.  The possibility of falling into the abyss now became
unpredictable.  The quota system combined with personal vendettas meant
that anyone could be persecuted, for nothing.

The vernacular caught the mood.  Among the categories ofrighfists were
'lots-drawing rightists' (chou-qianyou-pal), people who drew lots to
decide who should be named as rightists, and 'toilet rightists' (ce-suo
you-pat), people who found they had been nominated in their absence
after they could not restrain themselves from going to the toilet
during the many long, drawn-out meetings.  There were also rightists
who were said to 'have poison but not released it'

Oeou-du Im-J~ng); these were people who were named as rightists without
having said anything against anyone.

When a boss did not like someone, he could say: "He doesn't look
right," or "His father was executed by the

Communists, how can he not feel resentful?  He just won't say it
openly."  A kindhearted unit leader sometimes did the opposite: "Whom
should I nail?  I can't do that to anyone.

Say it's me."  He was popularly called a 'self-acknowledged rightist'
(zi-ren you-pal).

For many people 1957 was a watershed.  My mother was still devoted to
the Communist cause, but doubts crept in about its practice.  She
talked about these doubts with her friend Mr.  Hau, the purged director
of the research institute, but she never revealed them to my father not
because he had no doubts, but because he would not discuss them with
her.  Party rules, like military orders, forbade members from talking
about Party policies among themselves.  It was stipulated in the Party
charter that every member must unconditionally obey his Party
organization, that a lower-rank official must obey a higher-rank one.
If you had any disagreement, you could mention it only to a higher-rank
official, who was deemed to be an inca marion of the Party
organization. This regimental discipline, which the Communists had
insisted on since the Yan'an days and earlier, was crucial to their
success.  It was a formidable instrument of power, as it needed to be
in a society where personal relationships overrode any other rules.  My
father

19o ~tfler the Anti-Rightist Campaign..."

adhered to this discipline totally.  He believed that the revolution
could not be preserved and sustained if it were challenged openly.  In
a revolution you had to fight for your side even if it was not perfect
as long as you believed it was better than the other side.  Unity was
the categorical imperative.

My mother could see that as far as my father's relationship with the
Party was concerned, she was an outsider.

One day, when she ventured some critical comments about the situation
and got no response from him, she said bitterly, "You are a good
Communist, but a rotten husband!"

My father nodded.  He said he knew.

Fourteen years later, my father told us children what had almost
happened to him in 1957.  Since his early days in Yan'an, when he was a
young man of twenty, he had been close friends with a well-known woman
writer called Ding Ling.  In March 1957, when he was in Peking leading
the Sichuan delegation at a Public Affairs conference, she sent him a
message inviting him to visit her in Tianjin, near Peking.  My father
wanted to go, but decided against it because he was in a hurry to get
home.  Several months later Ding Ling was labeled as the number-one
rightist in China.

"If I had gone to see her," my father told us, "I would have been done
for too."

12.  "Capable Women Can Make a Meal without Food' Famine

(1958-19dr)

In the autumn of 1958, when I was six, I started going to a primary
school about twenty minutes' walk from home, mostly along muddy cobbled
back alleys.  Every day on my way to and from school, I screwed up my
eyes to search every inch of ground for broken nails, rusty cogs, and
any other metal objects that had been trodden into the mud between the
cobbles.  These were for feeding into furnaces to produce steel, which
was my major occupation.  Yes, at the age of six, I was involved in
steel production, and had to compete with my schoolmates at handing in
the most scrap iron.  All around me uplifting music blared from
loudspeakers, and there were banners, posters, and huge slogans painted
on the walls proclaiming "Long Live the Great Leap Forward!"  and
"Everybody, Make Steel{' Although I did not fully understand why, I
knew that Chairman Mao had ordered the nation to make a lot of steel.
In my school, crucible-like vats had replaced some of our cooking woks
and were sitting on the giant stoves in the kitchen.

All our scrap iron was fed into them, including the old

292 "Capable Women Can Make a Meal without Food' woks, which had now
been broken to bits.  The stoves were kept permanently lit until they
melted down.  Our teachers took turns feeding firewood into them around
the-clock, and stirring the scraps in the vats with a huge spoon. We
did not have many lessons, as the teachers were too preoccupied with
the vats.  So were the older, teenage children.  The rest of us were
organized to clean the teachers' apa~iments and babysit for them.

I remember visiting a hospital once with some other children to see one
of our teachers who had been seriously burned when molten iron had
splashed onto her arms.  Doctors and nurses in white coats were rushing
around frantically.  There was a furnace on the hospital grounds, and
they had to feed logs into it all the time, even when they were
performing operations, and right through the night.

Shortly before I started going to school, my family had moved from the
old vicarage into a special compound, which was the center of
government for the province.  It enclosed several streets, with blocks
of apatiments and offices and a number of mansions; a high wall blocked
it off from the outside world.  Inside the main gate was what had been
the US Servicemen's Club during the Second World War.  Ernest Hemingway
had stayed there in 194x.

The club building was in traditional Chinese style, with the ends of
its yellow filed roof turning upward, and heavy dark red pillars.  It
was now the office of the secretariat of the Sichuan government.

A huge furnace was erected in the parking lot where the chauffeurs used
to wait.  At night the sky was lit up, and the noise of the crowds
around the furnace could be heard 3o0 yards away in my room.  My
family's woks went into this furnace, together with all our cast-iron
cooking utensils.  We did not suffer from their loss, as we did not
need them anymore.  No private cooking was allowed now, and everybody
had to eat in the canteen.  The furnaces were insatiable.  Gone was my
parents' bed, a so~~, comfortable one with iron springs.  Gone also
were the iron railings from the city pavements, and anything else that
was iron.

I hardly saw my parents for months.  They often did not come home at
all, as they had to make sure the temperature in their office furnaces
never dropped.

It was at this time that Mao gave full vent to his halfbaked dream of
turning China into a first-class modern power.  He called steel the
"Marshal' of industry, and ordered steel output to be doubled in one
year from 5.35 million tons in 1957 to zo.7 million in 1958.  But
instead of trying to expand the proper steel industry with skilled
workers, he decided to get the whole population to take part.  There
was a steel quota for every unit, and for months people stopped their
normal work in order to meet it.  The country's economic development
was reduced to the simplistic question of how many tons of steel could
be produced, and the entire nation was thrown into this single act.  It
was officially estimated that nearly zoo million peasants were pulled
out of agricultural work and into steel production.  They had been the
labor force producing much of the country's food.  Mountains were
stripped bare of trees for fuel.  But the output of this mass
production amounted only to what people called 'caMe droppings'
(nill-shi-ge-day meaning useless turds.

This absurd situation reflected not only Mao's ignorance of how an
economy worked, but also an almost metaphysical disregard for reality,
which might have been interesting in a poet, but in a political leader
with absolute power was quite another matter.  One of its main
components was a deep-seated contempt for human life.  Not long before
this he had told the Finnish ambassador, "Even if the United States had
more powerful atom bombs and used them on China, blasted a hole in the
earth, or blew it to pieces, while this might be a matter of great
significance to the solar system, it would still be an insignificant
matter as far as the universe as a whole is concerned."

Mao's voluntarism had been fueled by his recent experience in Russia.
Increasingly disillusioned with Khrushchev after his denunciation of
Stalin in 1956, Mao went to Moscow in late 1957 to attend a world
Communist summit.

He returned convinced that Russia and its allies were abandoning
socialism and turning 'revisionist."  He saw China as the only true
believer.  It had to blaze a new path.

Megalomania and voluntarism meshed easily in Mao's mind.

Mao's fixation on steel went largely unquestioned, as did his other
obsessions.  He took a dislike to sparrows they devour grain.  So every
household was mobilized.  We sat outside ferociously beating any metal
object, from cymbals to saucepans, to scare the sparrows off the trees
so they would eventually drop dead from exhaustion.  Even today I can
vividly hear the din made by my siblings and me, as well as by the
government officials, sitting under a mammoth wolfoerry tree in our
courtyard.

There were also fantastic economic goals.  Mao claimed that China's
industrial output could overtake that of the United States and Britain
within fifteen years.  For the Chinese, these countries represented the
capitalist world.

Overtaking them would be seen as a triumph over their enemies.  This
appealed to people's pride, and boosted their enthusiasm enormously.
They had felt humiliated by the refusal of the United States and most
major Western countries to grant diplomatic recognition, and were so
keen to show the world that they could make it on their own that they
wanted to believe in miracles.  Mao provided the inspiration.  The
energy of the population had been eager to find an outlet.  And here it
was.  The gung-ho spirit overrode caution, as ignorance triumphed over
reason.

In early 1958, shortly after returning from Moscow, Mao visited
Chengdu for about a month.  He was fired up with the idea that China
could do anything, especially seize the leadership of socialism from
the Russians.  It was in

Chengdu that he outlined his "Great Leap Forward."  The city organized
a big parade for him, but the participants had no idea that Mao was
there.  He lurked out of sight.

At this parade a slogan was put forward, "Capable women can make a meal
without food," a reversal of a pragmatic ancient Chinese saying, "No
matter how capable, a woman cannot make a meal without food."
Exaggerated rhetoric had become concrete demands.  Impossible fantasies
were supposed to become reality.

It was a gorgeous spring that year.  One day Mao went for an outing to
a park called the Thatched Cottage of Du Fu, the eighth century Tang
poet.  My mother's Eastern District office was responsible for the
security of one area of the park, and she and her colleagues patrolled
it, pretending to be tourists.  Mao rarely kept to a schedule, or let
people know his precise movements, so for hours and hours my mother sat
sipping tea in the teahouse, trying to keep on the alert.  She finally
grew restless and told her colleagues she was going for a walk.  She
strayed into the security area of the Western District, whose staff did
not know her, and was immediately followed.  When the Party secretary
of the Western District received reports about a 'suspicious woman' and
came to see for himself, he laughed: "Why, this is old Comrade Xia from
the Eastern District!"  Afterward my mother was criticized by her boss,
district chief Guo, for 'running around without discipline."

Mao also visited a number of farms in the Chengdu Plain.  Thus far,
peasant cooperatives had been small.  It was here that Mao ordered them
all to be merged into bigger institutions, which were later called
'people's communes."

That summer, all of China was organized into these new units, each
containing between 2,000 and 20,000 households.  One of the forerunners
of this drive was an area called Xushui, in Hebei province in North
China, to which Mao took a shine.  In his eagerness to prove that they
deserved Mao's attention, the local boss there claimed they were going
to produce over ten times as much grain as before.  Mao smiled broadly
and responded: "What are you going to do with all that food?  On second
thought, it's not too bad to have too much food, really.  The state
doesn't want it.  Everybody else has plenty of their own.  But the
farmers here can just eat and eat.  You can eat five meals a day!"  Mao
was intoxicated, indulging in the eternal dream of the Chinese peasant-
surplus food.  After these remarks, the villagers further stoked the
desires of their Great Leader by claiming that they were producing more
than a million pounds of potatoes per mu (one mu is one-sixth of an
acre), over 130,000 pounds of wheat per mu, and cabbages weighing 500
pounds each.

It was a time when telling fantasies to oneself as well as others, and
believing them, was practised to an incredible degree.  Peasants moved
crops from several plots of land to one plot to show Party officials
that they had produced a miracle harvest.  Similar "Potemkin fields'
were shown off to gullible or self-blinded agricultural scientists,
reporters, visitors from other regions, and foreigners.

Although these crops generally died within a few days because of
untimely transplantation and harmful density, the visitors did not know
that, or did not want to know.  A large part of the population was
swept into this confused, crazy world.

"Self-deception while deceiving others' (~ioqiqi-ren) gripped the
nation.  Many people including agricultural scientists and senior Party
leaders Said they saw the miracles themselves.  Those who failed to
match other people's fantastic claims began to doubt and blame
themselves.  Under a dictatorship like Mao's, where information was
withheld and fabricated, it was very difficult for ordinary people to
have confidence in their own experience or knowledge.  Not to mention
that they were now facing a nationwide tidal wave of fervor which
promised to swamp any individual cool headedness  It was easy to start
ignoring reality and simply put one's faith in Mao.  To go along with
the frenzy was by far the easiest course.  To pause and think and be
circumspect meant trouble.

An official cartoon portrayed a mouselike scientist wh~=

ingA stove like yours can only boil water to make tea."

Next to him stood a giant worker, lifting a huge sluice gate releasing
a flood of molten steel, who retorted, "How much can you drink?"  Most
who saw the absurdity of the situation were too frightened to speak
their minds, particularly after the Anti-Rightist Campaign of 1957.
Those who did voice doubts were immediately silenced, or sacked, which
also meant discrimination against their family and a bleak prospect for
their children.

In many places, people who refused to boast of massive increases in
output were beaten up until they gave in.  In Yibin, some leaders of
production units were trussed up with their arms behind their backs in
the village square while questions were hurled at them:

"How much wheat can you produce per mu?"

"Four hundred fin' (about 450 pounds a realistic amount).

Then, beating him: "How much wheat can you produce per mu?"

"Eight hundred fin."

Even this impossible figure was not enough.  The unfortunate man would
be beaten, or simply left hanging, until he finally said: "Ten thousand
fin."  Sometimes the man died hanging there because he refused to
increase the figure, or simply before he could raise the figure high
enough.

Many grass-roots officials and peasants involved in scenes like this
did not believe in the ridiculous boasting, but fear of being accused
themselves drove them on.  They were carrying out the orders of the
Party, and they were safe as long as they followed Mao.  The
totalitarian system in which they had been immersed had sapped and
warped their sense of responsibility.  Even doctors would boast about
miraculously healing incurable diseases.

Trucks used to turn up at our compound carrying grinning peasants
coming to report on some fantastic, recordbreaking achievement.  One
day it was a monster cucumber half as long as the truck.  Another time
it was a tomato carded with difficulty by two children.  On another
occasion there was a giant pig squeezed into a truck.  The peasants
claimed they had bred an actual pig this size.  The pig was only made
of papier-m~eh~, but as a child I imagined that it was real.  Maybe I
was confused by the adults around me, who behaved as though all this
were true.  People had learned to defy reason and to live with
acting.

The whole nation slid into doublespeak.  Words became divorced from
reality, responsibility, and people's real thoughts.  Lies were told
with ease because words had lost their meanings and had ceased to be
taken seriously by others.

This was entrenched by the further regimentation of society.  When he
first set up the communes, Mao said their main advantage was that 'they
are easy to control," because the peasants would now be in an organized
system rather than being, to a certain extent, left alone.  They were
given detailed orders from the very top about how to fill their land.
Mao summed up the whole of agriculture in eight characters: 'soil,
fertilizer, water, seeds, dense planting, protection, tending,
technology."  The Party Central Committee in Peking was handing out
two-page instructions on how peasants all over China should improve
their fields, another page on how to use fertilizers, another on
planting crops densely.  Their incredibly simplistic instructions had
to be strictly followed: the peasants were ordered to replant their
crops more densely in one mini-campaign after another.

Another means of regimentation, setting up canteens in the communes,
was an obsession with Mao at the time.  In his airy way, he defined
communism as 'public canteens with free meals."  The fact that the
canteens themselves did not produce food did not concern him.  In 1958
the regime effectively banned eating at home.  Every peasant had to eat
in the commune canteen.  Kitchen utensils like woks and, in some
places, money were outlawed.  Everybody was going to be looked after by
the commune and the state.

The peasants filed into the canteens every day after work and ate to
their hearts' content, which they had never been able to do before,
even in the best years and in the most fertile areas.  They consumed
and wasted the entire lbod reserve in the countryside.  They filed into
the fields, too.

But how much work was done did not matter, because the produce now
belonged to the state, and was completely unrelated to the peasants'
lives.  Mao put forward the prediction that China was reaching a
society of communism, which in Chinese means 'sharing material goods,"
and the peasants took this to mean that they would get a share anyway,
regardless of how much work they did.  With no incentive to work, they
just went to the fields and had a good snooze.

Agriculture was also neglected because of the priority given to steel.
Many of the peasants were exhausted from having to spend long hours
finding fuel, scrap iron, and iron ore and keeping the furnaces going.
The fields were often left to the women and children, who had to do
everything by hand, as the animals were busy making their contribution
to steel production.  When harvest time came in autumn 1958, few people
were in the fields.

The failure to get in the harvest in 1958 flashed a warning that a food
shortage was on its way, even though official statistics showed a
double-digit increase in agricultural output.  It was officially
announced that in 1958 China's wheat output had overtaken that of the
United States.  The Party newspaper, the People's Daily, started a
discussion on the topic "How do we cope with the problem of producing
too much food?"

My father's depa~Unent was in charge of the press in Sichuan, which
printed outlandish claims, as did every publication in China.  The
press was the voice of the Party, and when it came to Party policies,
neither my father nor anyone else in the media had any say.  They were
part of a huge conveyor belt.  My father watched the turn of events
with alarm.  His only option was to appeal to the top leaders.

At the end of 1958 he wrote a letter to the Central Committee in Peking
stating that producing steel like this was pointless and a waste of
resources; the peasants were exhausted, their labor was being
squandered, and there was a food shortage.  He appealed for urgent
action.

He gave the letter to the governor to pass on.  The governor, Lee
Da-zhang, was the number-two man in the province.  He had given my
father his first job when he had come to Chengdu from Yibin, and
treated him like a friend.

Governor Lee told my father he was not going to forward the letter.
Nothing in it was new, he said.

"The Party knows everything.  Have faith in it."  Mao had said that
under no circumstances must the people's morale be dampened.

The Great Leap Forward had changed the psychological attitude of the
Chinese from passivity to a can-do, get-up and-go spirit, he said,
which must not be imperiled.

Governor Lee also told my father that he had been given the dangerous
nickname "Opposition' among the provincial leaders, to whom he had
voiced disagreements.  It was only because of his other qualities, his
absolute loyalty to the

Party and his stern sense of discipline, that my father was still all
right.

"The good thing," the governor said, 'is that you only voiced your
doubts to the Party, and not to the public."  He warned my father he
could get into serious trouble if he insisted on raising these
concerns, as could his family and 'others," clearly meaning himself, my
father's friend.  My father did not insist.  He was half convinced by
the argument, and the stakes were too high.  He had reached a stage
where he was not insusceptible to compromise.

But my father and the people working in the departments of Public
Affairs collected a great number of complaints, as part of their jobs,
and forwarded them to Peking.

There was general discontent among the people and officials alike.  In
fact, the Great Leap Forward triggered off the most serious split in
the leadership since the Communists had taken power a decade before. 
Mao had to step down from the less important of his two main posts,
president of the state, in favor of Liu Shaoqi.  Liu became the
number-two man in China, but his prestige was only a fraction of that
of Mao, who kept his key post as chairman of the Party.

The voices of dissent grew so strong that the Party had to convene a
special conference, which was held at the end of June 1959 in the
mountain resort of Lushan, in central China.  At the conference the
defense minister, Marshal Peng Dehual, wrote a letter to Mao
criticizing what had happened in the Great Leap Forward and
recommending a realistic approach to the economy.  The letter was
actually rather restrained, and ended on the obligatory note of
optimism (in this case, catching up with Britain in four years).

But although Peng was one of Mao's oldest comrades, and one of the
people closest to him, Mao could not take even this slight criticism,
particularly at a time when he was on the defensive, because he knew he
was wrong.  Using the aggrieved language of which he was enamored, Mao
called the letter 'a bombardment intended to level Lushan."  He dug in
his heels and dragged the conference out for over a month, fiercely
attacking Marshal Peng.  Peng and the few who openly supported him were
branded 'rightist opportunists."  Peng was dismissed as defense
minister, placed under house arrest, and later sent into premature
retirement in Sichuan, where he was assigued a lowly post.

Mao had had to scheme hard to preserve his power.

In this he was a supreme master.  His favorite reading, which he
recommended to other Party leaders, was a classic multi-volume
collection about court power and intrigues.  In fact, Mao's rule was
best understood in terms of a medieval court, in which he exercised
spellbinding power over his courtiers and subjects.  He was also a
maestro at 'divide and rule," and at manipulating men's inclination to
throw others to the wolves.  In the end, few top officials stood up for
Marshal Peng, in spite of their private disenchantment with Mao's
policies.  The only one who avoided having to show his hand was the
general secretary of the Party, Deng Xiaoping, who had broken his leg.
Deng's stepmother had been grumbling at home, "I was a farmer all my
life and I have never heard of such a nonsensical way of farming?  When
Mao heard how Deng had broken his leg playing billiards he commented,
"How very convenient."

Commissar Li, the Sichuan first secretary, returned to Chengdu from the
conference with a document containing the remarks Peng had made at
Lushan.  This was distributed to officials of Grade 17 and above; they
were asked to state formally whether they agreed with it.

My father had heard something about the Lushan dispute from the
governor of Sichuan.  At his 'exam' meeOng my father made some vague
remarks about Penbes letter.

Then he did something he had never done before: he warned my mother
that it was a trap.  She was greatly moved.  This was the first time he
had ever put her interests before the rules of the Party.

She was surprised to see that a lot of other people seemed to have been
tipped off as well.  At her collective 'exam," half of her colleagues
showed flaming indignation against Peng's letter, and claimed the
criticisms in it were 'totally untrue."  Others looked as though they
had lost their ability to speak, and mumbled something evasive.  One
man managed to straddle the fence, saying, "I am not in a position to
agree or disagree because I do not know whether the evidence given by
Marshal Peng is factual or not.  If it is, I would support him.  Of
course, I would not if it were not true."

The chief of the grain bureau for Chengdu and the chief of the Chengdu
post office were Red Army veterans who had fought under Marshal Peng.
They both said they agreed with what their old and much-revered
commander had said, adding their own experiences in the countryside to
back up Peng's observations.  My mother wondered whether these old
soldiers knew about the trap.  If so, the way they spoke their minds
was heroic.

She wished she had their courage.  But she thought of her children what
would happen to them?  She was no longer the free spirit she had been
as a student.  When her turn came she said, "The views in the letter
are not in keeping with the policies of the Party over the last couple
of years."

She was told by her boss, Mr.  Guo, that her remarks were thoroughly
unsatisfactory because she had failed to state her attitude.  For days
she lived in a state of acute anxiety.  The Red Army veterans who had
supported Peng were denounced as 'rightist opportunists," sacked, and
sent to do manual labor.  My mother was called to a meeting to have her
'right-wing tendencies' criticized.  At the meeting, Mr.  Guo described
another of her 'serious errors."  In 1959 a sort of black market had
sprung up in Chengdu selling chickens and eggs.  Because the communes
had taken over chickens from individual peasants, and were incapable of
raising them, chickens and eggs had disappeared from the shops, which
were state owned.  A few peasants had somehow managed to keep one or
two chickens at home under their beds, and were now surreptitiously
selling them and their eggs in the back alleys at about twenty times
their previous price.  Officials were sent out every day to try to
catch the peasants.  Once, when my mother was asked by Mr.  Guo to go
on one of these raids, she said, "What's wrong with supplying things
people need?  If there is demand, there should be supply."  Because of
this remark, my mother was given a warning about her 'right-wing
tendencies."

The purge of 'rightist opportunists' rocked the Party once again, as a
great many officials agreed with Peng.  The lesson was that Mao's
authority was un challengeable even though he was clearly in the wrong.
Officials could see that no matter how high up you were Peng, after
all,

was the defense minister and no matter what your standing - Peng had
reputedly been Mao's favorite if you offended Mao you would fall into
disgrace.  They also knew that you could not speak your mind and
resign, or even resign quietly: resignation was seen as an unacceptable
protest.  There was no opting out.  The mouths of the Party as well as
the people were now tightly sealed.  After this, the Great Leap Forward
went into further, madder excesses.  More impossible economic goals
were imposed from on high.

More peasants were mobilized to make steel.  And more arbitrary orders
rained down, causing chaos in the countryside.

At the end of 1958, at the height of the Great Leap Forward, a massive
construction project was begun: ten great buildings in the capital,
Peking, to be completed in ten months to mark the tenth anniversary, x
October 1959, of the founding of the People's Republic.

One of the ten buildings was the Great Hall of the People, a
Soviet-style columned edifice on the west side of Tiananmen Square. Its
marbled front was a good quarter of a mile long, and its chandeliered
main banqueting hall could seat several thousand people. This was where
important meetings were to be held and the leaders were to receive
foreign visitors.  The rooms, all to be on a grand scale, were named
after the provinces of China.  My father was put in charge of the
decoration of the Sichuan Room, and when the work was completed he
invited Party leaders who had been connected with Sichuan to inspect
it.  Deng Xiaoping, who was from Sichuan, came, as did Marshal Ho Lung,
a famous Robin Hood figure who had been one of the founders of the Red
Army, and was a close friend of Deng's.

At one point my father was called away, leaving these two and another
old colleague of theirs, actually Deng's brother, chatting among
themselves.  As he came back into the room he heard Marshal Ho saying
to Deng's brother, while pointing at Deng: "It really should be him on
the throne."  At that moment they spotted my father and immediately
stopped talking.

My father was in a state of intense apprehension after this.  He knew
he had accidentally overheard hints of disagreements at the top of the
regime.  Any conceivable action, or inaction, could get him into deadly
trouble.  In fact, nothing happened to him, but when he told me about
the incident almost ten years later he said he had lived with the fear
of disaster ever since.

"Just to have heard that amounts to treason," he said, using a phrase
which means 'a crime bringing decapitation."

What he had overheard was nothing but an indication of some
disenchantment with Mao.  This sentiment was shared by many top
leaders, not least by the new president, Liu Shaoqi.

In autumn 1959 Liu came to Chengdu to inspect a commune called "Red
Splendor."  The previous year, Mao had been highly enthusiastic about
the astronomical rice output there.  Before Liu arrived the local
officials rounded up anyone they thought might expose them, and locked
them up in a temple.  But Liu had a 'mole," and as he was walking past
the temple he stopped and asked to have a look inside.  The officials
made various excuses, even claiming that the temple was about to
collapse, but Liu refused to take no for an answer.  Eventually the
big, rusty lock was clicked open, and a group of shabby peasants
stumbled out into the daylight.  The embarrassed local officials tried
to explain to Liu that these were 'troublemakers' who had been locked
up because they might harm the distinguished visitor.  The peasants
themselves were silent.  Commune officials, though completely impotent
regarding policies, held awesome power over people's lives.  If they
wanted to punish someone, they could give him the worst job to do, the
least food, and invent an excuse to have him harassed, denounced, even
arrested.

President Liu asked some questions, but the peasants just smiled and
mumbled.  From their point of view it was better to offend the
president than the local bosses.  The president would be leaving for
Peking in a few minutes, but the commune bosses would be with them for
the rest of their lives.

Shortly afterward another senior leader also came to Chengdu Marshal
Zhu De accompanied by one of Mao's private secretaries.  Zhu De was
from Sichuan and had been the commander of the Red Army, and military
architect of the Communists' victory.  Since 1949 he had kept a low
profile.  He visited several communes near Chengdu, and afterward, as
he strolled by the Silk River looking at the pavilions, bamboo groves,
and willow embraced teahouses along the riverbank, he waxed emotional:
"Sichuan is indeed a heavenly place .... He spoke the words in the
style of a line of poetry.  Mao's secretary added the matching line, in
the traditional poets' fashion:

"Pity that damning gales of lie telling and false communism are
destroying it!"  My mother was with them, and thought to herself: I
agree wholeheartedly.

Suspicious of his colleagues, and still angry about being attacked at
Lushan, Mao obstinately stuck to his crazy economic policies.  Although
he was not unaware of the disasters they had been causing, and was
discreetly allowing some of the most impracticable ones to be revised,
his 'face' would not allow him to give up completely.  Meanwhile, as
the sixties began, a great famine spread across the whole of China.

In Chengdu, the monthly food ration for each adult was reduced to 19
pounds of rice, 3.5 ounces of cooking off, and 3-5 ounces of meat, when
there was any.

Scarcely anything else was available, not even cabbage.

Many people were afflicted by edema, a condition in which fluid
accumulates under the skin because of malnutrition.

The patient turns yellow and swells up.  The most popular remedy was
eating chlorella, which was supposed to be rich in protein.  Chlorella
fed on human urine, so people stopped going to the toilet and peed into
spittoons instead, then dropped the chlorella seeds in; they grew into
something looking like green fish roe in a couple of days, and were
scooped out of the urine, washed, and cooked with rice.  They were
truly disgusting to eat, but did reduce the swelling.

Like everybody else, my father was entitled only to a limited food
ration.  But as a senior official he had some privileges.  In our
compound there were two canteens, a small one for depa~u'ental
directors and their wives and children, and a big one for everyone
else, which included my grandmother, my aunt Jun-ying, and the maid.
Most of the time we collected our food at the canteens and took it home
to eat.  There was more food in the canteens than on the streets.  The
provincial government had its own farm, and there were also 'presents'
from county governments.  These valuable supplies were divided between
the canteens, and the small one got preferential treatment.

As Party officials, my parents also had special food coupons.  I used
to go with my grandmother to a special store outside the compound to
buy food with them.  My mother's coupons were blue.  She was entitled
to five eggs, almost an ounce of soybeans, and the same amount of sugar
per month.  My father's coupons were yellow.  He was entitled to twice
as much as my mother because of his higher rank.

My family pooled the food from the canteens and the other sources and
ate together.  The adults always gave the children more, so I did not
go hungry.  But the adults all suffered from malnutrition, and my
grandmother developed slight edema.  She grew chlorella at home, and I
was aware that the adults were eating it, although they would not tell
me what it was for.  Once I tried a little, and immediately spat it out
as it tasted revolting.  I never had it again.

I had little idea that famine was raging all around me.

One day on my way to school, as I was eating a small steamed roll,
someone rushed up and snatched it from my hands.  As I was recovering
from the shock, I caught a glimpse of a very thin, dark back in shorts
and bare feet running down the mud alley with his hand to his mouth,
devouring the roll.  When I told my parents what had happened, my
father's eyes were terribly sad.  He stroked my head and said, "You are
lucky.  Other children like you are starving."

I often had to visit the hospital for my teeth at that time.

Whenever I went there I had an attack of nausea at the horrible sight
of dozens of people with shiny, almost transparent swollen limbs, as
big as barrels.  The patients were carried to the hospital on flat
carts, there were so many of them.  When I asked my dentist what was
wrong with them, she said with a sigh, "Edema."  I asked her what that
meant, and she mumbled something which I vaguely linked with food.

These people with edema were mostly peasants.  Starvation was much
worse in the countryside because there were no guaranteed rations.
Government policy was to provide food for the cities first, and commune
officials were having to seize gram from the peasants by force.  In
many areas, peasants who tried to hide food were arrested, or beaten
and tortured.  Commune officials who were reluctant to take food from
the hungry peasants were themselves dismissed, and some were physically
maltreated.  As a result, the peasants who had actually grown the food
died in the millions all over China.

I learned later that several of my relatives from Sichuan to Manchuria
had died in this famine.  Among them was my father's retarded brother.
His mother had died in 1958, and when the famine struck he was unable
to cope as he would not listen to anyone else's advice.  Rations were
allotted on a monthly basis, and he ate his within days, leaving
nothing for the rest of the month.  He soon starved to death.  My
grandmother's sister, Lan, and her husband, "Loyalty' Pei-o, who had
been sent to the inhospitable countryside in the far north of Manchuria
because of his old connection with Kuomintang intelligence, both died
too.  As food began to run out, the village authorities allocated
supplies according to their own, unwritten priorities.

Pei-o's outcast status meant that he and his wife were among the first
to be denied food.  Their children survived because their parents gave
their food to them.  The father of Yu-lin's wife also died.  At the
end, he had eaten the stuffing in his pillow and the braids of garlic
plants.

One night, when I was about eight, a tiny, very old looking woman, her
face a mass of wrinkles, walked into our house.  She looked so thin and
feeble it seemed a puff of wind would blow her down.  She dropped to
the ground in front of my mother and banged her forehead on the floor,
calling her 'the savior of my daughter."  She was our maid's mother.

"If it wasn't for you," she said, 'my daughter would not survive .... I
did not grasp the full meaning of this until a month later, when a
letter came for our maid.

It said that her mother had died soon after visiting our house, where
she had passed on the news that her husband and her younger son were
dead.  I will never forget the heart-rending sobs of our maid as she
stood on the terrace, leaning against a wooden pillar and stifling her
moans in her handkerchief.  My grandmother sat cross-legged on her bed,
weeping as well.  I hid myself in a corner outside my grandmother's
mosquito net.  I could hear my grandmother saying to herself: "The
Communists are good, but all these people are dead .... Years later, I
heard that our maid's other brother and her sister-in-law died soon
after this.

Landlords' families were placed at the bottom of the list for food in a
starving commune.

In ,989 an official who had been working in famine relief told me that
he believed that the total number of people who had died in Sichuan was
seven million.  This would be 10 percent of the entire population of a
rich province.  An accepted estimate for the death toll for the whole
country is around thirty million.

One day in 1960, the three-year-old daughter of my aunt Jun-ying's
next-door neighbor in Yibin went missing.

A few weeks later the neighbor saw a young girl playing in the street
wearing a dress that looked like her daughter's.

She went up and examined it: it had a mark which identified it as her
daughter's.  She reported this to the police.

It turned out that the parents of the young girl were selling
wind-dried meat.  They had abducted and murdered a number of babies and
sold them as rabbit meat at exorbitant prices.  The couple were
executed and the case was hushed up, but it was widely known that baby
killing did go on at the time.

Years later I met an old colleague of my father's, a very kind and
capable man, not given to exaggeration.  He told me with great emotion
what he had seen during the famine in one particular commune.
Thirty-five percent of the peasants had died, in an area where the
harvest had been good although little was collected, since the men had
been pulled out to produce steel, and the commune canteen had wasted a
large proportion of what there was.  One day a peasant burst into his
room and threw himself on the floor, screaming that he had committed a
terrible crime and begging to be punished.  Eventually it came out that
he had killed his own baby and eaten it.  Hunger had been like an
uncontrollable force driving him to take up the knife.  With tears
rolling down his cheeks, the official ordered the peasant to be
arrested.  Later he was shot as a warning to baby killers.

One official explanation for the famine was that Khrushchev had
suddenly forced China to pay back a large debt it had incurred during
the Korean War in order to come to the aid of North Korea.  The regime
played on the experience of much of the population, who had been
landless peasants and could remember being hounded by heartless
creditors to pay rent or reimburse loans.  By identifying the Soviet
Union, Mao also created an external enemy to take the blame and to
rally the population.

Another cause mentioned was 'unprecedented natural

calamities."  China is a vast country, and bad weather causes food
shortages somewhere every year.  No one but the highest leaders had
access to nationwide information about the weather.  In fact, given the
immobility of the population, few knew what happened in the next
region, or even over the next mountain.  Many thought then, and still
think today, that the famine was caused by natural disasters. I have no
full picture, but of all the people I have talked to from different
parts of China, few knew of natural calamities in their regions.  They
only have stories to tell about deaths from starvation.

At a conference for 7,000 top-ranking officials at the beginning of
1962, Mao said that the famine was caused 7o percent by natural
disasters and 3o percent by human error.  President Liu Shaoqi chipped
in, apparently on the spur of the moment, that it was caused 3o percent
by natural disasters and 7o percent by human error.  My father was at
the conference, and when he returned he said to my mother: "I fear
Comrade Shaoqi is going to be in trouble."

When the speeches were relayed to lower-rank officials like my mother,
President Liu's assessment was cut out.

The population at large was not even told about Mao's figures.  This
concealing of information did help keep the people quiet, and there
were no audible complaints against the Communist Party.  Quite apart
from the fact that most dissenters had been killed off or otherwise
suppressed in the past few years, whether the Communist Party was to
blame was far from clear to the general population.  There was no
corruption in the sense of officials hoarding grain.

Party officials were only marginally better off than the ordinary
people.  In fact, in some villages they themselves starved first and
died first.  The famine was worse than anything under the Kuomintang,
but it looked different:

in the Kuomintang days, starvation took place alongside blatant
unchecked extravagance.

Before the famine, many Communist officials from landlords' families
had brought their parents to stay with them in the cities.  When the
famine hit, the Party gave orders for these elderly men and women to be
sent back to their villages to share the hard life meaning starvation
with the local peasants.  The idea was that Communist officials should
not be seen to be using their privileges to benefit their 'class-enemy'
parents.  Some grandparents of friends of mine had to leave Chengdu and
died in the famine.

Most peasants lived in a world where they did not look much beyond the
boundary of the village, and they blamed the famine on their immediate
bosses for giving them all the catastrophic orders.  There were popular
rhymes to the effect that the Party leadership was good, only the
grass-roots officials were rotten.

The Great Leap Forward and the appalling famine shook my parents
deeply.  Although they did not have the full picture, they did not
believe that 'natural calamities' were the explanation.  But their
overwhelming feeling was one of guilt.  Working in the field of
propaganda, they were right in the center of the misinformation
machine.  To salve his conscience, and to avoid the dishonest daily
routine, my father volunteered to help with famine relief in the
communes.  This meant staying and starving with the peasants.  In doing
so, he was 'sharing weal and woo with the masses," in line with Mao's
instructions, but it was resented by his staff.  They had to take turns
going with him, which they hated, because it meant going hungry.

From late 1959 to 196I, in the worst period of the famine, I seldom saw
my father.  In the countryside he ate the leaves of sweet potatoos,
herbs, and tree bark like the peasants.  One day he was walking along a
bank between the paddy fields when he saw a skeletal peasant moving
extremely slowly, and with obvious difficulty, in the distance.  Then
the man suddenly disappeared.  When my father rushed over, he was lying
in the field, dead of starvation.

Every day my father was devastated by what he saw, although he hardly
saw the worst, because in the customary manner local officials
surrounded him everywhere he went.

But he suffered bad hepatomegaly and edema and deep depression. Several
times when he came back from his trips he went straight into the
hospital.  In the summer of 1961, he stayed there for months.  He had
changed.  He was no longer the assured puritan of yesteryear.  The
Party was not pleased with him.  He was criticized for 'letting his
revolutionary will wane' and ordered out of the hospital.

He took to spending a lot of time fishing.  Across from the hospital
there was a lovely river called the Jade Brook.

Willows bent over to stroke its surface with their curving shoots, and
clouds melted and solidified in their many reflections.  I used to sit
on its sloping bank gazing at the clouds and watching my father fish.
The smell was of human manure.  On top of the bank were the hospital
grounds, which had once been flowerbeds, but had now been turned into
vegetable fields to supply the staff and patients with additional food.
When I close my eyes now, I can still see the larvae of the butterflies
eating away at the cabbage leaves.  My brothers caught them for my
father to use as bait.  The fields had a pathetic look.

The doctors and nurses were obviously no experts on farming.

Throughout history Chinese scholars and mandarins had traditionally
taken up fishing when they were disillusioned with what the emperor was
doing.  Fishing suggested a retreat to nature, an escape from the
politics of the day.  It was a kind of symbol for disenchantment and
noncooperation.

My father seldom caught any fish, and once wrote a poem with the line:
"Not for the fish I go fishing."  But his angling companion, another
deputy director of his department, always gave him part of his catch.
This was because in 1961, in the middle of the famine, my mother was
pregnant again, and the Chinese regard fish as essential for the
development of a baby's hair.  She had not wanted another

3 I4 "Capable Women Can Make a Meal without Food' child.  Among other
things, she and my father were on salaries, which meant the state no
longer provided them with wet-nurses or nannies.  With four children,
my grandmother, and part of my father's family to support, they did not
have a lot of money to spare.  A large chunk of my father's salary went
for buying books, particularly huge volumes of classical works, one set
of which could cost two months' salary.  Sometimes my mother grumbled
slightly:

other people in his position dropped hints to the publishing houses and
got their copies free, 'for work purposes."  My father insisted on
paying for everything.

Sterilization, abortion, and even contraception were difficult.  The
Communists had started promoting family planning in 1954, and my mother
was in charge of the program in her district.  She was then in an
advanced stage of pregnancy with Xiao-her, and often started her
meetings with a good-humored self-criticism.  But Mao turned against
birth control.  He wanted a big, powerful China, based on a large
population.  He said that if the Americans dropped atomic bombs on
China, the Chinese would 'just go on reproducing' and reconstitute
their numbers at great speed.  He also shared the traditional Chinese
peasant's attitude toward children: the more hands the better.  In
1957, he personally named a famous Peking University professor who had
advocated birth control as a rightist.  After that, family planning was
seldom mentioned.

My mother had become pregnant in 1959, and had written to the Party
asking for permission to have an abortion.

This was the standard procedure.  One reason the Party had to give its
consent was that the operation was a dangerous one at the time.  My
mother had said that she was busy working for the revolution, and could
serve the people better if she did not have another baby.  She was
granted an abortion, which was dreadfully painful because the method
used was primitive.  When she became pregnant again in 1961, another
abortion was out of the question in the opinion of the doctors, my
mother herself, and the Party., which stipulated a minimum three-year
gap between abortions.

Our maid was also pregnant.  She had married my father's former
manservant, who was now working in a factory.  My grandmother cooked
both of them the eggs and soybeans which could be obtained with my
parents' coupons, as well as the fish which my father and his colleague
caught.

Our maid gave birth to a boy at the end of 1961 and left to set up her
own home with her husband.  When she was still with us, she would go to
the canteens to fetch our food.  One day my father saw her walking
along a garden path stuffing some meat into her mouth and chewing
voraciously.  He turned and walked away in case she saw him and was
embarrassed.  He did not tell anyone until years later when he was
ruminating over how differently things had turned out from the dreams
of his youth, the main one of which had been putting an end to
hunger.

When the maid left, my family could not afford another one, because of
the food situation.  Those who wanted the job women from the
countryside were not entitled to a food allocation.  So my grandmother
and my aunt had to look after the five of us.

My youngest brother, Xiao-fang, was born on 17 January 1962.  He was
the only one of us who was breast-fed by my mother.  Before he was
born, my mother had wanted to give him away, but by the time he arrived
she had become deeply attached to him, and he became the favorite.  We
all played with him as though he were a big toy.  He grew up surrounded
by loving crowds, which, my mother ,~o.

"dieved, accounted for his ease and confidence.  My father spent a lot
of time with him, which he had never done with his other children. When
Xiao-fang was old enough to play with toys, my father carried him every
Saturday to the depa,hnent store at the top of the street and bought
him a new toy.  The moment Xiao-fang started to cry, for any
reason, my father
would drop everything and rush to comfort him.

By the beginning of 1961, tens of millions of deaths had finally forced
Mao to give up his economic policies.  Reluctantly, he allowed the
pragmatic President Liu and Deng Xiaoping, general secretary of the
Party, more control over the country.  Mao was forced to make
self-criticisms, but they were full of self-pity, and were always
phrased in such a way that it sounded as if he was carrying the cross
for incompetent officials all over China.  He further magnanimously
instructed the Party to 'draw lessons' from the disastrous experience,
but what the lessons were was not left to the judgment of the lowly
officials: Mao told them they had become divorced from the people, and
had made decisions which did not reflect ordinary people's feelings.

Starting from Mao, the endless self-criticisms masked the real
responsibility, which no one pursued.

Nevertheless, things began to improve.  The pragmatists put through a
succession of major reforms.  It was in this context that Deng Xiaoping
made the remark: "It doesn't matter whether the cat is white or black,
as long as it catches mice."  There was to be no more mass production
of steel.  A stop was put to crazy economic goals, and realistic
policies were introduced.  Public canteens were abolished, and
peasants' income was now related to their work.  They were given back
household property, which had been confiscated by the communes,
including farm implements and domestic animals.  They were also allowed
small plots of land to till privately.  In some areas, land was
effectively leased out to peasant households.  In industry and
commerce, elements of a market economy were officially sanctioned, and
within a couple of years the economy was flourishing again.

Hand in hand with the loosening up of the economy, there was also
political liberalization.  Many landlords had the label of 'class
enemy' removed.  A large number of people who had been purged in the
various political campaigns were 'rehabilitated."  These included the
counterrevolution ari from 1955, 'rightists' from 1957, and 'rightist
opportunists' from 1959.  Because my mother had received a warning for
her 'right-wing tendencies' in 1959, in 1962 she was raised from Grade
17 to Grade 16 in her civil service rank as compensation.  There was
greater literary and artistic freedom.  A more relaxed general
atmosphere prevailed.  For my father and mother, as for many others,
the regime seemed to be showing it could correct and learn from its
mistakes and that it could work and this restored their confidence in
it.

While all this was going on I lived in a cocoon behind the high walls
of the government compound.  I had no direct contact with tragedy.  It
was with these 'noises off' that I embarked on my teens.

13.  "Thousand-Gold

Ultle Precious' In a Priwlelled Cocoon

(1P58-1965)

When my mother took me to register at primary school in 1958, I was
wearing a new pink cord jacket and green flannel trousers with a huge
pink ribbon in my hair.  We went straight into the office of the
headmistress, who was waiting for us with the academic supervisor and
one of the teachers.  They were all smiling, and they addressed my
mother respectfully as "Director Xia' and treated her like a V.I.P.
Later I learned that the school came under my mother's depariment.

I had this special interview because I was six, and nor really they
only took children from the age of seven, as there was a shortage of
schools.  But even my father did not mind the rules being bent this
time, as he and my mother both wanted me to start school early.  My
fluent recitation of classical poems and my handsome calligraphy
convinced the school I was advanced enough.  After I had satisfied the
headmistress and her colleagues in the standard entrance test, I was
accepted as a special case.  My parents were tremendously proud of me.
Many of their

In a Privileged Cocoon 319 colleagues' children had been turned down by
this school.

Everyone wanted to get their children into this school because it was
the best in Chengdu, and the top 'key' school for the whole province.
It was very difficult to get into the key schools and universities.
Entrance was strictly on merit, and children from officials' families
were not given priority.

Whenever I was introduced to a new teacher, it was always as 'the
daughter of Director Chang and Director Xia."  My mother often came to
the school on her bicycle as part of her job, to check on how it was
being run.  One day the weather suddenly turned cold, and she brought a
warm green cord jacket with flowers embroidered on the front for me.
The headmistress herself came to my classroom to give it to me.  I was
terribly embarrassed with all my classmates staring at me.  Like most
children, I just wanted to belong and to be accepted as part of my peer
group.

We had exams every week and the results were put up on the notice
board.  I was always at the top of the class, which was rather resented
by those behind me.  They sometimes took their bitterness out on me by
calling me 'thousand-gold little precious' (qian-jin xiao-jie), doing
things like putting a frog in my desk drawer, and tying the ends of my
plaits to the back of my seat.  They said I had no 'collective spirit'
and looked down on others.  But I knew I simply liked being on my
own.

The curriculum was like that in a Western school, except during the
period when we had to produce steel.  There was no political education,
but we did have to do a lot of sports: running, high jump and long
jump, as well as compulsory, gym and swimming.  We each had one after
school sport: I was selected for tennis.  At first my father was
against the prospect of my becoming a sportswoman, which was the
purpose of the training, but the tennis coach, a very pretty young
woman, came to see him, dressed in her fetching shorts.  Among his
other jobs, my father was

32o "Thousand-Gold Little Precious' in charge of sports for the
province.  The coach gave him her most charming smile and told him that
since tennis, the most elegant of sports, was not played much in China
at the time, it would be good if his daughter set an example - 'for the
nation," as she put it.  My father had to give in.

I loved my teachers, who were excellent and had the girl of making
their subjects fascinating and exciting.  I remember the science
teacher, a Mr.  Dali who taught us the theory behind putting a
satellite into orbit (the Russians had just launched the first Sputnik)
and the possibility of visiting other planets.  Even the most unruly
boys were glued to their seats during his lessons.  I overheard some
pupils saying that he had been a rightist, but none of us knew what
this meant, and it did not make any difference to us.

My mother told me years later that Mr.  Dali had been a writer of
children's science fiction.  He was named a rightist in 1957 because he
had written an article about mice stealing food and fattening
themselves up, which was alleged to be a covert attack on Party
officials.  He was banned from writing, and was about to be sent to the
countryside when my mother managed to get him relocated to my school.
Few officials were brave enough to reemploy a rightist.

My mother was, and this was the very reason she was in charge of my
school.  According to its location, it should have come under the
Western District of Chengdu.  But the city authorities assigned it to
my mother's district in the east because they wanted it to have the
best teachers, even if they came from 'undesirable' backgrounds, and
the head of the Public Affairs Department of the Western District would
not dare to give such people jobs.  The academic supervisor in my
school was the wife of a former Kuomintang officer who was in a labor
camp.  Usually people with a background like hers would not have been
able to occupy a job like this, but my mother refused to transfer them,
and even gave them honorary grades.  Her superiors approved, but they
wanted her to take the responsibility for this unorthodox behavior. She
did not mind.

With the implicit additional protection which my father's position
brought her, she felt more secure than her colleagues.

In 1962 my father was invited to send his children to a new school that
had just been set up next to the compound where we lived.  It was
called "Plane Tree' after the trees which formed an avenue on the
grounds.  The school was set up by the Western District with the
express purpose of making it into a key school, since there was no key
school under the jurisdiction of this district.  Good teachers were
transferred to Plane Tree from other schools in the district.

The school soon acquired a reputation as the 'aristocratic school' for
the children of VIPs in the provincial government.

Before Plane Tree was set up there had been one boarding school in
Chengdu, for the children of top army officers.  A few senior ci 'vdian
officials also sent their children there.  Its academic level was poor,
and it earned a reputation for snobbery, as the children were highly
competitive about their parents.  They could often be heard saying
things like: "My father is a division commander.

Yours is ouly a brigadier!"  At weekends there were long lines of cars
outside, with nannies, bodyguards, and chauffeurs waiting to take the
children home.  Many people thought the atmosphere was poisoning the
children, and my parents had always been totally averse to this
school.

Plane Tree was not set up as an exclusive school, and after meeting the
headmaster and some of the teachers, my parents felt that it was
committed to high ethical standards and discipline.  There were only
about twenty-five pupils in each year.  Even in my previous school
there had been fifty pupils in my class.  The advantages of Plane Tree
were, of course, partly intended for the benefit of the top

322 "Thousand-Gold Little Precious' officials who lived next door, but
my newly mellowed father overlooked this fact.

Most of my new classmates were children of officials in the provincial
government.  Some lived in the compound with me.  Apart from school,
the compound was my entire world.  The gardens were filled with flowers
and luxuriant plants.  There were palm trees, sisal hemps, oleanders,
magnolias, camellias, roses, hibiscus, and even a pair of rare Chinese
aspens which had grown toward each other and intertwined their arms,
like lovers.  They were very sensitive, too.  If we scratched one of
the trunks even ever so gently the two trees would tremble and their
leaves would start to flutter.  During the summer lunch breaks I would
sit on a drum-shaped stone stool under a trellis of wisteria, my elbows
resting on a stone table reading a book or playing chess.  Around me
were the blazing colors of the grounds and not far away a rare coconut
tree thrust arrogantly into the sky.  My favorite, though, was a
heavily scented jasmine, also climbing on a big trellis.  When it was
in blossom, my room was filled with its fragrance.  I loved to sit by
the window gazing at it and soaking up the delicious smell.

When we first moved into the compound we lived in a lovely detached
one-story house set in its own courtyard.

It was built in traditional Chinese style, with no modern facilities:
no running water indoors, no flush toilet, no ceramic bath.  In 1961,
some modern Western-type apartments with all these amenities were built
in one corner of the compound, and my family was assigned one of
them.

Before we moved in, I visited this wonderland and examined all the
novel and magical taps and flush toilets and mirrored cupboards on the
walls.  I ran my hand along the shiny white files on the walls of the
bathrooms.  They felt cool and pleasant to the touch.

There were thirteen apartment blocks in the compound.

Four were for the directors of departments, the rest for bureau chiefs.
Our apartment occupied a whole floor,

whereas the bureau chiefs had to share a floor between two families.
Our rooms were more spacious.  We had anti mosquito screens on our
inner windows, which they did not, and two bathrooms, while they had
only one.  We had hot water three days a week, whereas they had none. 
We had a telephone, which was extremely rare in China, and they did
not. Lesser officials occupied blocks in a smaller compound on the
other side of the street, and their amenities were one grade lower
still. The half-dozen Party secretaries who formed the core of the
provincial leadership had their own inner compound within our compound.
This inner sanctum lay behind two gates, which were guarded
around-the-clock by army guards with guns, and only specially
authorized personnel were allowed through.

Inside these gates were detached two-story houses, one for each Party
secretary.  On the doorstep of the first secretary, Li Jing-quan, stood
yet another armed guard.  I grew up taking hierarchy and privilege for
granted.

All adults working in the main compound had to show their passes when
they came through the main gate.  We children had no passes, but the
guards recognized us.

Things became complicated if we had visitors.  They had to fill out
forms, then the porter's lodge would ring our apartment and someone had
to go all the way down to the front gate to collect them.  The staff
did not welcome other children.  They said they did not want the
grounds messed up.  This discouraged us from bringing friends home, and
during the whole of my four years in the top key school I invited
girlfriends home only a very few times.

I hardly ever went outside the compound except to go to school.  A few
times I went to a depa~is,lent store with my grandmother, but I never
felt the need to buy anything.

Shopping was an alien concept to me, and my parents gave me pocket
money only on special occasions.  Our canteen was like a restaurant,
and served excellent food.  Except during the famine, there were always
at least seven or eight dishes from which to choose.  The chefs were
handpicked,

and were all either 'grade one' or 'special grade."  Top chefs were
graded like teachers.  At home, there were always sweets and fruit.
There was nothing else I wanted to eat except ice 1ollies.  Once, on
Children's Day, I June, when I was given some pocket money, I ate
twenty-six in one go.

Life in the compound was self-contained.  It had its own shops,
hairdressers, cinemas, and dance halls, as well as plumbers and
engineers.  Dancing was very popular.  On weekends there were different
dancing parties for the different levels of staff in the provincial
government.  The one in the former US servicemen's ballroom was for
families at and above the level of bureau chief.  It always had an
orchestra, and actors and actresses from the Provincial Song and Dance
Troupe to make it more colorful and elegant.  Some of the actresses
used to come to our apartment to chat with my parents, and then they
would take me for a walk around the compound.  I was terribly proud to
be seen in their company, as actors and actresses were endowed with
tremendous glamour in China.  They enjoyed special tolerance and were
allowed to dress more flamboyantly than other people, and even to have
affairs.

Since the troupe came under his department, my father was their boss.
But they did not defer to him like other people.  They used to tease
him and call him 'the star dancer."  My father just smiled and looked
shy.  The dancing was a kind of casual ballroom dancing, and the
couples glided up and down rather demurely on the highly polished
floor.  My father was indeed a good dancer, and he obviously enjoyed
himself.  My mother was no good at it she could not get the rhythm
right, so she did not like it.

During the intervals, the children were allowed onto the dance floor,
and we pulled each other by the hands and did a kind of floor skiing.
The atmosphere, the heat, the perfume, the glamorously dressed ladies
and beaming gentlemen formed a dreamy, magical world for me.

There were films every Saturday evening.  In 1962, with the more
relaxed atmosphere, there were even some from

Hong Kong, mostly love stories.  They gave a glimpse of the outside
world, and were very popular.  There were also, of course, uplifting
revolutionary films.  The screenings were held in two different places,
according to status.  The elite one was in a spacious hall with big,
comfortable seats.

The other was in a large auditorium in a separate compound and was
jam-packed.  I went there once because it was showing a film I wanted
to see.  The seats had all been taken long before the film started.
Latecomers had to bring their own stools.  Lots of people were
standing.  If you were stuck at the back, you had to stand on a chair
to see anything.  I had no idea it was going to be like this, and had
not brought a stool.  I was caught in the crush at the back, unable to
see a thing.  I glimpsed a chef I knew who was standing on a short
bench which could seat two people.

When he saw me squeezing past, he asked me to get on it with him.  It
was very narrow and I felt terribly unsteady.

People kept pushing by, and soon one of them knocked me off.  I fell
quite hard and cut my eyebrow on the edge of a stool.  The scar is
still there today.

In our elite hall there were more restricted films which were not shown
to anyone else, even the staff in the big auditorium.  These were
called 'reference films' and were made up mostly of clips of films from
the West.  This was the first time I ever saw a miniskirt or the
Beatles.  I remember one film showed a Peeping Tom at the seaside;

the women he had been peeping at poured a bucket of water over him.
Another extract from a documentary showed abstract painters using a
chimpanzee to daub ink on a sheet of paper and a man playing the piano
with his bottom.

I suppose these must have been selected to show how decadent the West
was.  They were only for high Party officials, and even they were
denied access to most information about the West.  Occasionally, a film
from the West was shown in a small screening room where children were
not allowed.  I was intensely curious and begged my parents to take me.
They agreed a couple of times.  By then my father had become quite soft
with us.  There was a guard at the door, but because I was with my
parents, he did not object.  The films were totally beyond me.  One
seemed to be about an American pilot going mad after dropping an atom
bomb on Japan.  The other was a black-and-white feature film.  In one
scene a trade union leader was punched by two thugs in a car: blood
trickled out of the corner of his mouth.  I was absolutely horrified.
This was the first time in my life I had ever seen an act of violence
with blood being shed (corporal punishment in schools had been
abolished by the Communists).  Chinese films in those days were gentle,
sentimental, and uplifting; if there was even a hint of violence it was
stylized, as in Chinese opera.

I was baffled by the way the Western workers were dressed in neat suits
that were not even patched, a far cry from my idea of what the
oppressed masses in a capitalist country ought to be wearing.  After
the film I asked my mother about this and she said something about
'relative living standards."  I did not understand what she meant, and
the question remained with me.

As a child, my idea of the West was that it was a miasma of poverty and
misery, like that of the homeless "Little Match Girl' in the Hans
Christian Andersen story.  When I was in the boarding nursery and did
not want to finish my food, the teacher would say: "Think of all the
starving children in the capitalist world!"  In school, when they were
trying to make us work harder, the teachers often said:

"You are lucky to have a school to go to and books to read.

In the capitalist countries children have to work to support their
hungry families."  Often when adults wanted us to accept something they
would say that people in the West wanted it, but could not get it, and
therefore we should appreciate our good fortune.  I came to think this
way automatically.  When I saw a girl in my class wearing a new kind of
pink translucent raincoat I had never seen, I thought how nice it would
be to swap my commonplace old

In a Privileged Cocoon 3 z7 wax-paper umbrella for one.  But I
immediately castigated myself for this 'bourgeois' tendency, and wrote
in my diary: "Think of all the children in the capitalist world they
can't even think of owning an umbrella!"

In my mind foreigners were terrifying.  All Chinese have black hair and
brown eyes, so they regard differently colored hair and eyes as
strange.  My image of a foreigner was more or less the official
stereotype: a man with red, unkempt hair, strange-colored eyes, very,
very long nose, stumbling around drunk, pouring Coca-Cola into his
mouth from a bottle, with his legs splayed out in a most inelegant
position.  Foreigners said 'hello' all the time, with an odd
intonation.  I did not know what 'hello' meant; I thought it was a
swear word.  When boys played 'guerrilla warfare," which was their
version of cowboys and Indians, the enemy side would have thorns glued
onto their noses and say 'hello' all the time.

During my third year in primary school, when I was nine, my classmates
and I decided to decorate our classroom with plants.  One of the girls
suggested she could get some unusual ones from a garden which her
father looked after at a Catholic church on Safe Bridge Street.  There
had once been an orphanage attached to the church, but it had been
closed down.  The church was still functioning, under the control of
the government, which had forced Catholics to break with the Vatican
and join a 'patriotic' organization.  The idea of a church was both
mysterious and frightening, because of the propaganda about religion.

The first time I ever heard about rape was reading about one attributed
to a foreign priest in a novel.  Priests also invariably appeared as
imperialist spies and evil people who used babies from orphanages for
medical experiments.

Every day on my way to and from school, I used to walk past the top of
scholar-tree-lined Safe Bridge Street and see the profile of the church
gate.  To my Chinese eye, it had the most alien-looking pillars: they
were made of white marble, and were fluted in the Greek style,
whereas

3z8 "Thousand-Gold Little Precious' Chinese pillars were always made of
painted wood.  I was dying to look inside, and had asked the girl to
let me visit her home, but she said her father did not want her to
bring any visitors.  This only increased the mystery.  When this girl
offered to get some plants from her garden I eagerly volunteered to go
with her.

As we approached the church gate I tensed up and my heart almost
stopped beating.  It seemed to be the most imposing gate I had ever
seen.  My friend stood on tiptoe and reached up to bang a metal ring on
the gate.  A small door creaked open in the gate, revealing a wrinkled
old man, bent almost double.  To me he seemed like a witch in one of
the illustrations in a fairy tale.  Although I could not see his face
clearly, I imagined that he had a long hooked nose and pointed hat and
was about to ride up into the sky on a broomstick.  The fact that he
was of a different sex from a witch was irrelevant to me.  Avoiding
looking at him, I hurried through the doorway.  Immediately in front of
me was a garden in a small, neat courtyard.  I was so nervous I could
not see what was in it.  My eyes could only register a proliferation of
colors and shapes, and a small fountain trickling in the middle of a
rockery.  My friend took my hand and led me along the arcade around the
courtyard.  On the far side, she opened a door and told me that that
was where the priest delivered his sermons.

Sermons!  I had come across this word in a book in which the priest
used his 'sermon' to pass state secrets to another imperialist spy.  I
tensed up even more when I crossed the threshold into a large, dark
room, which seemed to be a hall; for a moment I could not see anything.
Then I saw a statue at the end of the hall.  This was my first
encounter with a crucifix.  As I got nearer, the figure on the cross
seemed to be hovering over me, enormous and crushing.

The blood, the posture, and the expression on the face combined to
produce an utterly terrifying sensation.  I turned and dashed out of
the church.  Outside, I nearly collided with a man in a black robe.  He
stretched out a hand to steady me; I thought he was trying to grab me,
and dodged and rushed away.  Somewhere behind me a heavy door creaked.
The next moment it was terrifyingly still except for the murmuring of
the fountain.  I opened the small door in the front gate and ran all
the way to the end of the street without stopping.  My heart was
pounding and my head was spinning.

Unlike me, my brother Jin-ming, who was born a year after me, was
independent-minded from a young age.  He loved science and read a lot
of popular scientific magazines.

Although these, like all other publications, carried the inevitable
propaganda, they did report advances in science and technology in the
West, and these impressed Jin-ming enormously.  He was fascinated by
photographs of lasers, Hovercraft, helicopters, electronics, and cars
in these magazines, in addition to the glimpses he got of the West in
the 'reference films."  He began to feel that school, the media, and
adults in general could not be trusted when they said that the
capitalist world was hell and China was paradise.

The United States in particular caught Jin-ming's imagination as the
country with the most highly developed technology.  One day when he was
eleven and was excitedly describing new developments in lasers in
America over the dinner table, he said to my father that he adored
America.

My father was at a loss about how to respond, and looked deeply
worried.  Eventually he strokedJin-ming's head and said to my mother,
"What can we do?  This child is going to grow up to become a
rightist!"

Before he was twelve, Jin-ming had made a number of 'inventions' based
on illustrations in children's science books, including a telescope
with which he tried to observe Halley's Comet and a microscope using
glass from a light bulb.  One day he was trying to improve a repeating
rubberband 'gun' which fired small stones and yew nuts.  In order to
create the right sound effect he asked a classmate of his,

whose father was an army officer, to find him some empty bullet
casings.  His friend got hold of some bullets, took off the ends,
emptied out the gunpowder, and gave them to Jin-ming without realizing
that the detonators were still inside.  Jin-ming filled a shell with a
cut-up toothpaste tube and held it over the coal stove in the kitchen
with tongs to bake it.  There was a kettle sitting on a grill over the
coal, and Jin-ming was holding the tongs under it when suddenly there
was an enormous bang, and a big hole in the bottom of the kettle.
Everyone rushed in to see what had happened.  Jin-ming was terrified.
Not because of the explosion, but because of my father, who was a very
intimidating figure.

But my father did not hit Jin-ming, or even scold him.

He just looked at him hard for a while, then said he was already scared
enough, and should go outside and take a walk.  Jin-ming was so
relieved he could hardly keep from jumping up and down.  He never
thought he would get off so easily.  After his walk, my father said he
was not to do any more experiments without being supervised by an
adult.  But he did not enforce this order for long, and soon Jin-ming
was carrying on as before.

I helped him with a couple of his projects.  Once we made a model
pulverizer powered by tap water which could crush chalk into powder.
Jin-ming provided the brains and the skill, of course.  My interest
never lasted.

Jin-ming went to the same key primary school as I did.

Mr.  Dali the science teacher who had been condemned as a rightist,
also taught him, and played a crucial role in opening up the world of
science to him.  Jin-ming has remained deeply grateful to him all his
life.

My second brother, Xiao-her, who was born in 1954, was my grandmother's
favorite, but he did not get much attention from my father and mother.
One of the reasons was that they thought he got enough affection from
my grandmother.  Sensing he was not in favor, Xiao-her became defensive
toward my parents.  This irritated them,

especially my father, who could not stand anything he considered un
straightforward

Sometimes he was so enraged by Xiao-her that he beat him.  But he would
regret it afterward, and at the first opportunity he would stroke
Xiao-her on the head and tell him he was sorry he had lost control of
his temper.  My grandmother would have a tearful row with my father,
and he would accuse her of spoiling Xiao-her.  This was a constant
source of tension between them.  Inevitably, my grandmother grew even
more attached to Xiao-her and spoiled him even more.

My parents thought that only their sons should be scolded and hit, and
not their daughters.  One of the only two times when my sister,
Xiao-hong, was hit was when she was five.  She had insisted on eating
sweets before a meal, and when the food came she complained that she
could not taste anything because of the sweet taste in her mouth.  My
father told her she had only got what she wanted.  Xiao-hong took
umbrage at this and started yelling and threw her chopsticks across the
dining room.  My father smacked her and she grabbed a feather duster to
hit him.  He snatched the duster away from her, so she got hold of a
broom.  After some scuffling, my father locked her in our bedroom and
kept saying, "Too spoiled!  Too spoiled!"  My sister missed her
lunch.

Xiao-hong was quite willful as a child.  For some reason, she
absolutely refused to watch films or plays, or to travel.

And there were a lot of things she hated eating: she would scream her
head off when she was fed milk, beef, or lamb.

When I was a child, I followed her example, and missed out on many
films and a lot of delicious food.

My character was very different, and people said I was both sensible
and sensitive (dong-shl) well before my teens.

My parents never laid a hand on me or said a harsh word to me.  Even
their rare criticisms were delivered extremely delicately, as if I were
a grown-up and easily wounded.

They gave me plenty of love, particularly my father, who always took
his after-supper walk with me, and often took me with him when he
visited his friends.  Most of his closest friends were veteran
rev,~lutionaries, intelligent and able, and they all seemed to have
something 'wrong' in their pasts in the eyes of the Party, and so had
been given only lowly posts.  One had been in the branch of the Red
Army led by Mao's challenger Zhang Guo-tao.  Another was a Don Juan-
his wife, a Party official whom my father always tried to avoid, was
insufferably stern.  I enjoyed these adult gatherings, but I liked
nothing better than to be alone with my books, which I sat reading all
day during my school holidays, chewing the ends of my hair.  Apart from
literature, including some reasonably simple classical poems, I loved
science fiction and adventure stories.  I remember one book about a man
spending what seemed to him to be a few days on another planet and
coming back to earth in the twenty-first century, finding everything
had changed.

People ate food capsules, traveled by Hovercraft, and had telephones
with video screens.  I longed to be living in the twenty-first century
with all these magic gadgets.

I spent my childhood racing toward the future, hurrying to be an adult,
and was always daydreaming about what I would do when I was older. From
the moment I could read and write, I preferred books with substantial
amounts of words to picture books.  I was also impatient in every other
way: when I had a sweet, I would never suck it, but bit into it and
chewed it at once.  I even chewed my cough lozenges.

My siblings and I got on unusually well.  Traditionally, boys and girls
seldom played together, but we were good friends and cared about each
other.  There was little jealousy or competitiveness, and we rarely had
rows.  Whenever my sister saw me crying, she would burst into tears
herself.  She did not mind hearing people praising me.  The good
relationship between us was much commented on, and parents of other
children were constantly asking my parents how they did it.

Between them my parents and my grandmother provided a loving family
atmosphere.  We saw only affection between our parents, never their
quarrels.  My mother never showed us her disenchantment with my father.
After the famine, my parents, like most officials, were no longer as
passionately devoted to their work as they had been in the 195os.
Family life took a more prominent place, and was no longer equated with
disloyalty.  My father, now over forty, mellowed and became closer to
my mother.  My parents spent more time together, and as I was growing
up I often saw evidence of their love for each other.

One day I heard my father telling my mother about a compliment paid to
her by one of his colleagues, whose wife had the reputation of being a
beauty.

"The two of us are lucky to have such outstanding wives," he had said
to my father.

"Look around: they stand out from everyone else."  My father was
beaming, recalling the scene with restrained delight.

"I smiled politely, of course," he said.

"But I was really thinking, How can you compare your wife with mine? My
wife is in a class of her own!"

Once my father went away on a three-week sight-seeing tour for the
directors of the Public Affairs departments of every province in China,
which was to take them all over the country.  It was the only such tour
ever given in the whole of my father's career and was supposed to be a
special treat.  The group enjoyed V.I.P treatment all the way, and a
photographer traveled with them, recording their progress.  But my
father was restless.  By the start of the third week, when the tour had
reached Shanghai, he missed home so much that he said he did not feel
well, and flew back to Chengdu.  Forever afterward, my mother would
call him a 'silly old thing."

"Your home wouldn't have flown away.  I wouldn't have disappeared.  Not
in that week, anyway.  What a chance you missed to have fun!"  I always
had a feeling when she said this that she was really quite pleased
about my father's 'silly homesickness."

In their relationship with their children, my parents seemed to be
concerned above all with two things.  One was our academic education.
No matter how preoccupied they were with their jobs, they always went
through our homework with us.  They were in constant touch with our
teachers, and firmly established in our heads that our goal in life was
academic excellence.  Their involvement in our studies increased after
the famine, when they had more spare time.  Most evenings, they took
turns giving us extra lessons.

My mother was our math teacher, and my father tutored us in Chinese
language and literature.  These evenings were solemn occasions for us,
when we were allowed to read my father's books in his study, which was
lined from floor to ceiling with thick hardbacks and thread-bound
Chinese classics.  We had to wash our hands before we turned the leaves
of his books.  We read Lu Xun, the great modern Chinese writer, and
poems from the golden ages of Chinese poetry, which were considered
difficult even for adults.

My parents' attention to our studies was matched only by their concern
for our education in ethics.  My father wanted us to grow up to be
honorable and principled citizens, which was what he believed the
Communist revolution was all about.  In keeping with Chinese tradition,
he gave a name to each of my brothers which represented his ideals:
Zhi, meaning 'honest," to Jin-ming; Pu, 'unpretentious," to Xiao-her;
and Fang, 'incorruptible," was part of Xiao-fang's name.  My father
believed that these were the qualities which had been lacking in the
old China and which the Communists were going to restore.  Corruption,
in particular, had sapped the old China.  Once he rebuked Jin-ming for
making a paper airplane out of a sheet of paper with his dep~iment
letterhead on it.  If we ever wanted to use the telephone at home we
had to get his permission.  As his job covered the media, he was
supplied with a lot of newspapers and periodicals.  He encouraged us to
read them, but they could not be taken out of his study.  At the end of
the month he took them back to his department, as old newspapers were
sold for recycling.  I spent many tedious Sundays helping him check
that not one was missing.

My father was always very strict with us, which was a constant source
of tension between him and my grandmother, and between him and us.  In
1965 one of the daughters of Prince Sihanouk of Cambodia came to
Chengdu to give a ballet performance.  This was a great novelty in a
society which was almost totally isolated.  I was dying to see the
ballet.  Because of his job, my father was given complimentary tickets,
the best, for all new performances, and he often took me.  This time,
for some reason, he could not go.  He gave me a ticket but said I had
to exchange it with somebody with a seat at the back so that I would
not be in the best seat.

That evening I stood by the door of the theater, holding my ticket in
my hand, while the audience crowded in all, in fact, with complimentary
tickets, allocated according to their rank.  A good quarter of an hour
passed and I was still by the door.  I was too embarrassed to ask
anyone to swap.  Eventually the number of people going in thinned out;
the performance was about to start.  I was on the verge of tears,
wishing I had a different father.  At that moment I saw a junior
official from my father's department.  I summoned up my courage and
pulled the edge of his jacket from behind.  He smiled and immediately
agreed to let me have his seat, which was right at the back.  He was
not surprised.  My father's strictness to his children was legendary in
our compound.

For Chinese New Year, 1965, a special performance was organized for
schoolteachers.  This time my father went to the performance with me,
but instead of letting me sit with him, he exchanged my ticket for one
at the very back.  He said it was inappropriate for me to sit in front
of the teachers.  I could hardly see the stage, and felt miserable.

Later I heard from the teachers how much they appreciated his
sensitivity.  They had been annoyed at seeing other high officials'
children lounging on the front seats in a manner which they regarded as
disrespectful.

Throughout China's history there was a tradition of officials' children
being arrogant and abusing their privileges.  This caused widespread
resentment.  Once a new guard in the compound did not recognize a
teenage girl who lived there and refused to let her in.  She screamed
at him and hit him with her satchel.  Some children talked to the
chefs, chauffeurs, and other staff in a rude and imperious manner. They
would call them by their names, which a younger person should never do
in China it is supremely disrespectful.  I will never forget the pained
look in the eyes of a chef in our canteen when the son of one of my
father's colleagues took some food back and said it was no good, and
shouted out his name.  The chef was deeply wounded, but said nothing. 
He did not want to displease the boy's father.  Some parents did
nothing about this kind of behavior by their children, but my father
was outraged.

Often he said: "These officials are no Communists."

My parents regarded it as very important that their children should be
brought up to be courteous and respectful to everyone.  We called the
service staff "Uncle' or "Aunt' So-and-so, which was the traditional
polite form for a child addressing an adult.  After we had finished our
meal, we always took the dirty bowls and chopsticks back to the
kitchen.  My father told us we should do this as a courtesy to the
chefs, as otherwise they would have to clear the tables themselves.
These small things earned us immense affection from the compound staff.
The chefs would keep food warm for us if we were late.  The gardeners
used to give me flowers or fruit.  And the chauffeur happily made
detours to pick me up and drop me home this was strictly behind my
father's back, as he would never let us use the car without him being
there.

Our modern apartment was on the third floor, and our balcony looked
down on a narrow alley of mud and cobbles outside the compound wall.
One side of the alley was the brick wall of the compound; the other was
a row of thin wooden one-story terraced houses, typical of poor
people's dwellings in Chengdu.  The houses had mud floors and no
toilets or running water.  Their facades were made out of vertical
planks, two of which served as the door.  The front room led directly
into another room, which led to another, and a row of several such
rooms formed the house.  The back room opened onto another street.
Since the side walls of the house were shared with neighbors, these
houses had no windows.  The inhabitants had to leave the doors at both
ends open to let in light or air.  Often, especially on hot summer
evenings, they would sit on the narrow pavement, reading, sewing, or
chatting.  From the pavement they could look straight up at the
spacious balconies of our apartments with their shiny glass windows. My
father said we must not offend the feelings of the people living in the
alley, and so he forbade us to play on the balcony.

On summer evenings, boys from the huts in the alley often used to walk
through the streets peddling anti mosquito incense.  They sang a
special tune to attract attention to their wares.  My evening reading
used to be punctuated by this lingering, sad tune.  Through my father's
constant reminding, I knew that being able to study undisturbed in a
big, cool room with a parquet floor and mosquito-netted open windows
was an enormous privilege.

"You must not think you are superior to them," he would say.

"You are just lucky to be here.  You know why we need communism?  So
that everyone can live in a good house like ours, and in much better
ones."

My father said things like this so often that I grew up feeling ashamed
of my privileges.  Sometimes boys from the compound would stand on
their balconies and mimic the tune the young peddlers sang.  I felt
ashamed when they did this.  When I went out with my father in his car,
I was always embarrassed when the car honked through the crowds.  If
people stared into the car, I would sink down in my seat and try to
avoid their gaze.

In my early teens I was a very serious girl.  I liked to be on my own,
thinking, often about moral issues that confused me.  I had become
rather lukewarm about games and fairgrounds and playing with other
children, and rarely gossiped with other girls.  Although I was
sociable and popular, there always seemed to be a certain distance
between me and the others.  In China people easily become familiar with
one another, particularly women.  But ever since I was a child, I have
always wanted to be left alone.

My father noticed this side of my character, and would comment on it
with approval.  While my teachers constantly said I should have more
'collective spirit," he told me that familiarity and living on top of
each other could be a destructive thing.  With this encouragement, I
kept my privacy and my space.  There are no exact words for these two
concepts in the Chinese language, but they were instinctively yearned
for by many, certainly by my siblings as well as me.  Jin-ming, for
instance, insisted so strongly on being allowed to lead his own life
that he was sometimes thought by those who did not know him to be
antisocial; in fact he was gregarious and extremely popular with his
peers.

My father often said to us, "I think it is marvelous that your mother
has this policy of "letting you roam free on the pasture."  Our parents
left us alone and respected our need to keep our separate worlds.

14.  "Father Is Close, Mother Is Close, but Neither Is as Close as
Chairman Mao' The Cult of Mao (1964-1965)

"Chairman Mao," as we always called him, began to impinge directly on
my life in 1964, when I was twelve.

Having been in retreat for some time after the famine, he was starting
his comeback, and in March of the previous year he had issued a call to
the whole country, particularly the young, to 'learn from Lei Feng."

Lei Feng was a soldier who, we were told, had died at the age of
twenty-two in 1962.  He had done an awful lot of good deeds going out
of his way a help the elderly, the sick, and the needy.  He had donated
his savings to disaster relief funds and given up his food rations to
comrades in the hospital.

Lei Feng soon began to dominate my life.  Every afternoon we left
school to 'do good deeds like Lei Feng."  We went down to the railway
station to try to help old ladies with their luggage, as Lei Feng had
done.  We sometimes had to grab their bundles from them forcibly
because some

340 '... but Neither Is as Close as Chairman Mao' countrywomen thought
we were thieves.  On rainy days, I stood on the street with an
umbrella, anxiously hoping that an old lady would pass by and give me
an opportunity to escort her home as Lei Feng had done.  If I saw
someone carrying water buckets on a shoulder pole old houses still did
not have running water t would try unsuccessfully to summon up the
courage to offer my help, although I had no idea how heavy a load of
water was.

Gradually, during the course of 1964, the emphasis began to shift from
boy scoutish good deeds to the cult of Mao.  The essence of Lei Feng,
the teachers told us, was his 'boundless love and devotion to Chairman
Mao."

Before he took any action, Lei Feng always thought of some words of
Mao's.  His diary was published and became our moral textbook.  On
almost every page there was a pledge like: "I must study Chairman Mao's
works, heed Chairman Mao's words, follow Chairman Mao's instructions,
and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao's."  We vowed to follow Lei Feng,
and be ready to 'go up mountains of knives and down seas of flames," to
'have our bodies smashed to powder and our bones crushed to
smithereens," to 'submit ourselves unquestioningly to the control of
the Great Leader' Mao.  The cult of Mao and the cult of Lei Feng were
two sides of the same coin: one was the cult of personality; the other,
its essential corollary, was the cult of impersonality.

I read my first article by Mao in 1964, at a time when two slogans of
Mao's - "Serve the People' and "Never Forget Class Struggle' dominated
our lives.  The essence of these two complementary slogans was
illustrated in Lei Feng's poem "The Four Seasons," which we all learned
by heart:

Like spring, I treat my comrades warmly.

Like summer, I am full of ardor for my revolutionary work.

The Cult of ,"rlao I eliminate my individualism as an autumn gale
sweeps away fallen leaves, And to the class enemy, I am cruel and
ruthless like harsh winter.

34~

In line with this, our teacher said we had to be careful whom we helped
on our do-good errands.  We must not help 'class enemies."  But I did
not understand who they were, and when I asked, neither the teachers
nor my parents were keen to elaborate.  One common answer was:

'like the baddies in the movies."  But I could not see anyone around me
who looked like the highly stylized enemy characters in the movies.
This posed a big problem.  I no longer felt sure about seizing bags
from old ladies.  I could not possibly ask, "Are you a class enemy?"

We sometimes went to clean the houses in an alley next to our school.
In one house there was a young man who used to lounge on a bamboo chair
watching us with a cynical smile as we toiled away on his windows.  Not
only did he not offer to help, he even wheeled his bicycle out of the
shed and suggested we clean that for him as well.

"What a pity," he once said, 'that you are not the real Lei Feng, and
that there are no photographers on hand to take your pictures for the
newspapers."  (Lei Feng's good deeds were miraculously recorded by an
official photographer.) We all hated the lounger with the dirty
bicycle.  Could he be a class enemy?  But we knew he worked at a
machinery factory, and workers, we had been repeatedly told, were the
best, the leading class in our revolution.  I was confused.

One of the things I had been doing was helping to push carts on the
streets after school.  The carts were often piled high with cement
blocks or chunks of sandstone.  They were terribly heavy, and every
step was an enormous effort for the men who pulled them.  Even in cold
weather, some would be bare-chested, and shiny beads of sweat trickled
down their faces and backs.  If the road was even slightly uphill, it
was very hard for some of them to keep going.

Whenever I saw them, I was attacked by a wave of sadness.

Since the campaign to learn from Lei Feng had started, I had stood by a
ramp waiting for carts to pass.  I would be exhausted after helping to
push just one of them.  As I left off, the man pulling would give me an
almost imperceptible sideways smile, trying not to break his stride and
lose momentum.

One day a classmate said to me in a very serious tone of voice that
most of the people pulling carts were class enemies who had been
assigned to do hard labor.  Therefore, she told me, it was wrong to
help them.  I asked my teacher, since I, in accordance with Chinese
tradition, always turned to teachers for authority.  But instead of her
normal air of confidence, she looked unsettled and said she did not
know the answer, which puzzled me.  In fact, it was actually true that
people pulling carts had often been assigned the job because they had
Kuomintang links, or because they were victims of one of the political
purges.

My teacher obviously did not want to tell me this, but she did ask me
to stop helping to push carts.  From then on, every time I happened on
a cart in the street, I averted my eyes from the bent figure trudging
along and quickly walked away with a heavy heart.

To fill us with hatred for class enemies, the schools started regular
sessions of 'recalling bitterness and reflecting on happiness," at
which older people would tell us about the miseries of pre-Communist
China.  Our generation had been born 'under the red flag' in new China,
and had no idea what life was like under the Kuomintang.

Lei Feng had, we were taught, which was why he could hate the class
enemies so deeply and love Chairman Mao with all his heart.  When he
was seven, his mother was supposed to have hanged herself after being
raped by a landlord.

Workers and peasants came to give talks at our school:

we heard of childhoods dominated by starvation, freezing winters with
no shoes, and premature, painful deaths.  They

told us how boundlessly grateful they were to Chairman Mao for saving
their lives and giving them food and clothing. One speaker was a member
of an ethnic group called the Yi, who had a system of slavery until the
late 195os.

He had been a slave and showed us scars from appalling beatings under
his previous masters.  Every time the speakers described the hardships
they had endured the packed hall was shaken by sobs.  I came out of
these sessions feeling devastated at what the Kuomintang had done, and
passionately devoted to Mao.

To show us what life without Mao would be like, every now and then the
school canteen cooked something called a 'bitterness meal," which was
supposed to be what poor people had to eat under the Kuomintang.  It
was composed of strange herbs, and I secretly wondered whether the
cooks were playing a practical joke on us it was truly unspeakable. The
first couple of times I vomited.

One day we were taken to an exhibition of 'class education' about
Tibet: on display were photos of dungeons crawling with scorpions, and
horrific instruments of torture, including a tool for scooping out eyes
and knives for cutting the tendons in the ankles.  A man in a
wheelchair who came to our school to give a talk told us he was a
former serf from Tibet who had had his ankle tendons severed for some
trivial offense.

Since 1964, large houses had also been opened as 'museums of class
education' to show how class enemies like landlords had lived in luxury
on the sweat and blood of the peasants before Mao came.  During the
holiday for Chinese New Year in 1965, my father took us to a famous
mansion two and a half hours' drive from home.  Underneath the
political justification, the journey was really an excuse for an outing
to the countryside in early spring, in accordance with the Chinese
tradition of 'walking on the tender green' (ta-qing) to welcome the
season.  This was one of the few occasions that my family ever went on
a trip out to the country.

As the car drove across the green Chengdu Plain along the
eucalyptus-lined asphalt road, I looked intently out of the window at
the lovely bamboo groves embracing the farmhouses, and the curving
smoke lingering above the thatched cottages peeping between the bamboo
leaves.

Occasionally, a branch of early plum blossom was reflected in the
streams that meandered around almost every thicket.

My father had asked us all to write an essay after the trip, describing
the scenery, and I observed everything with great care.  There was one
sight which puzzled me: the few trees dotted around the fields were
completely stripped of their branches and leaves except for the very
top, and looked like bare flagpoles with a cap of green.  My father
explained that firewood was scarce on the densely cultivated Chengdu
Plain, and that the peasants had cut off as many branches as they could
reach.  What he did not tell me was that there had been many more trees
until a few years before, but most of them had been cut down to feed
the furnaces to produce steel during the Great Leap Forward.

The countryside seemed extremely prosperous.  The market town where we
stopped for lunch was teeming with peasants in bright new clothes, the
older ones wearing shiny white turbans and clean dark-blue aprons.
Golden roast ducks glowed in the windows of the packed restaurants.
Deliciously scented clouds burst out of the lids of huge bamboo
steamers in the stalls on the crowded streets.  Our car crawled through
the market to the local government offices, which were in a mansion
with two stone lions squatting outside the gate.  My father had lived
in this county during the famine in 196I, and now, four years later,
the local officials wanted to show him how much had changed.  They took
us to a restaurant where a private room had been reserved for us.  As
we squeezed through the crowded restaurant the peasants stared at us,
obvious outsiders ushered in respectfully by the local bosses.  I saw
that the tables were covered with strange,

mouth-watering dishes.  I had hardly ever eaten anything except what we
were given in our canteen, and the food in this market town was full of
lovely surprises.  It had novel names too: "Pearl Balls,"

"Three Gunshots," "Lions' Heads."  Afterward the manager of the
restaurant said goodbye to us on the pavement while the local peasants
gawked at our entourage.

On the way to the museum, our car overtook an open truck with some boys
and girls from my school in it.  They were obviously going to the
'class-education' mansion as well.  One of my teachers was standing on
the back.  She smiled at me, and I shrank down in my seat with
embarrassment at the difference between our chauffeur-driven car and
the open truck on the bumpy road in the cold early spring air.  My
father was sitting in front with my youngest brother on his lap.  He
recognized my teacher and smiled back at her.  When he turned around to
attract my attention, he saw that I had completely disappeared.  He
beamed with pleasure.  My embarrassment showed my good qualities, he
said; it was good that I felt ashamed of privilege rather than
flaunting it.

I found the museum incredibly shocking.  There were sculptures of
landless peasants having to pay exorbitant rent.  One showed how the
landlord used two different measures: a big one for collecting grain
and a small one for lending it out at crippling interest, too.  There
were also a torture chamber and a dungeon with an iron cage sitting in
filthy water.  The cage was too small for a man to be able to stand up
straight, and too narrow for him to sit down.  We were told the
landlord used it to punish peasants who could not pay their rent.  One
room was said to have housed three wet-nurses who provided him with
human milk, which he believed was the most nutritious kind.  His
number-five concubine was said to have eaten thirty ducks a day not the
meat, only the feet, which were considered a great delicacy.

We were not told that the brother of this allegedly inhuman landlord
was now a minister in the government in Peking, having been given the
post as a reward for surrendering Chengdu to the Communists in 1949.

Throughout, while we were being instructed about the 'man-eating days
of the Kuomintang," we were reminded that we should be grateful to
Mao.

The cult of Mao went hand in hand with the manipulation of people's
unhappy memories of their past.  Class enemies were presented as
vicious malefactors who wanted to drag China back to the days of the
Kuomintang, which would mean that we children would lose our schools,
our winter shoes, and our food.  That was why we had to smash these
enemies, we were told.  Chiang Kai-shek was said to have launched
assaults on the mainland and tried to stage a comeback in 1962 during
the 'difficult period' the regime's euphemism for the famine.

In spite of all this talk and activity, class enemies for me, and for
much of my generation, remained abstract, unreal shadows.  They were a
thing of the past, too far away.  Mao had not been able to give them an
everyday material form.

One reason, paradoxically, was that he had smashed the past so
thoroughly.  However, the expectation of an enemy figure was planted in
us.

At the same time, Mao was sowing the seeds for his own deification, and
my contemporaries and I were immersed in this crude yet effective
indoctrination.  It worked partly because Mao adroitly occupied the
moral high ground: just as harshness to class enemies was presented as
loyalty to the people, so total submission to him was cloaked in a
deceptive appeal to be selfless.  It was very hard to get behind the
rhetoric, particularly when there was no alternative viewpoint from the
adult population.  In fact, the adults positively colluded in enhancing
Mao's cult.

For two thousand years China had an emperor figure who was state power
and spiritual authority rolled into one.

The religious feelings which people in other parts of the world have
toward a god have in China always been directed toward the emperor.  My
parents, like hundreds of millions of Chinese, were influenced by this
tradition.

Mao made himself more godlike by shrouding himself in mystery.  He
always appeared remote, beyond human approach.  He eschewed radio, and
there was no television.

Few people, except his court staff, ever had any contact with him. Even
his colleagues at the very top only met him in a sort of formal
audience.  After Yan'an, my father only set eyes on him a few times,
and then only at large-scale meetings.  My mother only ever saw him
once, when he came to Chengdu in 1958 and summoned all officials above
Grade I8 to have a group photo taken with him.

After the fiasco of the Great Leap Forward, he had disappeared almost
completely.

Mao, the emperor, fitted one of the patterns of Chinese history: the
leader of a nationwide peasant uprising who swept away a rotten dynasty
and became a wise new emperor exercising absolute authority.  And, in a
sense, Mao could be said to have earned his god-emperor status.

He was responsible for ending the civil war and bringing peace and
stability, which the Chinese always yearned for so much that they said
"It's better to be a dog in peacetime than a human being in war."  It
was under Mao that China became a power to be reckoned with in the
world, and many Chinese stopped feeling ashamed and humiliated at being
Chinese, which meant a tremendous amount to them.  In reality, Mao
turned China back to the days of the Middle Kingdom and, with the help
of the United States, to isolation from the world.  He enabled the
Chinese to feel great and superior again, by blinding them to the world
outside.  Nonetheless, national pride was so important to the Chinese
that much of the population was genuinely grateful to Mao, and did not
find the cult of his personality offensive, certainly not at first. The
near total lack of access to information and the systematic feeding of
disinformation meant that most Chinese had no way to discriminate
between Mao's successes and his failures, or to identi~ the relative
role of Mao and other leaders in the Communists' achievements.

Fear was never absent in the building up of Mao's cult.

Many people had been reduced to a state where they did not dare even to
think, in case their thoughts came out involuntarily.  Even if they did
entertain unorthodox ideas, few mentioned them to their children, as
they might blurt out something to other children, which could bring
disaster to themselves as well as their parents.  In the learn-from Lei
Feng years it was hammered into children that our first and only
loyalty should be to Mao.  A popular song went: "Father is close,
Mother is close, but neither is as close as Chairman Mao."  We were
drilled to think that anyone, including our parents, who was not
totally for Mao was our enemy.  Many parents encouraged their children
to grow up as conformists, as this would be safest for their future.

Self-censorship covered even basic information.  I never heard of
Yu-lin, or my grandmother's other relatives.  Nor was I told about my
mother's detention in 1955, or about the famine in fact, anything that
might sow a gram of doubt in me about the regime, or Mao.  My parents,
like virtually every parent in China, never said anything unorthodox to
their children.

In 1965, my New Year resolution was "I will obey my grandmother' - a
traditional Chinese way of promising to behave well.  My father shook
his head: "You should not say that.  You should only say "I obey
Chairman Mao."

On my thirteenth birthday, in March that year, my father's present was
not his usual books of science ficfon, but a volume containing the four
philosophical works of Mao.

Only one adult ever said anything to me which conflicted with the
official propaganda, and that was the stepmother of Deng Xiaoping, who
lived some of the time in the apartment block next to ours, with her
daughter, who worked in the provincial government.  She liked children,
and I was constantly in and out of her apariment.  When my friends and
I stole pickles from the canteen, or picked melon flowers and herbs
from the compound garden, we did not dare to take them home for fear of
being scolded, so we used to go to her apartment, where she would ~ash
and fry them for us.  This was all the more exciting because we were
eating something illicit.  She was about seven~ then but looked much
younger, with tiny feet and a gentle, smooth, but strong face.  She
always wore a gray cotton jacket and black cotton shoes, which she made
herself.  She was very relaxed and treated us like equals.  I liked
sitting in her kitchen chatting with her.  On one occasion, when I was
about thirteen, I went to see her straight after an emotional
'speak-bitterness' session.  I was bursting with compassion for anyone
who had had to live under the Kuomintang, and I said: "Grandma Deng,
how you must have suffered under the evil Kuomintang!  How the soldiers
must have looted you!  And the bloodsucking landlords!

What did they do to you?"

"Well," she answered, 'they didn't always loot ... and they were not
always evil .... Her words hit me like a bombshell.  I was so shocked
that I never told anyone what she had said.

At the time, none of us had any idea that the cult of Mao and the
emphasis on class struggle were part of Mao's plans for a showdown with
the president, Liu Shaoqi, and Deng Xiaoping, the general secretary of
the Party.  Mao was unhappy about what Liu and Deng were doing.  Since
the famine they had been liberalizing both the economy and the society.
To Mao, their approach smacked of capitalism rather than socialism. It
especially galled him that what he called 'the capitalist road' was
proving successful, while his chosen way, the 'correct' way, had turned
out to be a disaster.  As a practical man, Mao recognized this, and had
to allow them to have their way.  But he planned to impose his ideas
again as soon as the country was in good enough shape to stand the
experiment, and as soon as he could build-up enough momentum to
dislodge his powerful enemies in the Party.

35o '... but Neither Is as Close as Chairman Mao'

Mao found the idea of peaceful progress suffocating.  A restless
military leader, a warrior-poet, he needed action violent action and
regarded permanent human snuggle as necessary for social development.
His own Communists had become too tolerant and soft for his taste,
seeking to bring harmony rather than conflict.  There had been no
political campaigns, in which people fought each other, since 1959!

And Mao was sore.  He felt that his opponents had humiliated him by
showing him up as incompetent.  He had to take revenge, and, being
aware that his opponents had widespread support, he needed to increase
his authority hugely.  To achieve this, he needed to be deified.

Mao bided his time while the economy was recovering.

But as it improved, especially after 1964, he began to prepare the
grand opening of his confrontation.  The relative liberalization of the
early 1960s began to fade.

The weekly dances in the compound stopped in 1964.

So did the films from Hong Kong.  Out went my mother's fluffy bobs; in
came short, straight hair.  Her blouses and jackets were no longer
colorful or figure-hugging.  They were made of plain quiet colors and
looked like tubes.  I was particularly sorry to see her skirts go.  I
remembered how, a short time before, I had watched her getting off her
bicycle, gracefully lifting her blue-and-white check skirt with her
knee.  I was leaning against the mottled trunk of a plane tree that
formed part of the glade coveting the street outside the compound.  Her
skirt had been flowing like a fan as she rode toward me.  On summer
evenings, I had often pushed Xiao-fang there in his bamboo pram and
waited for her to come home.

My grandmother, now in her mid-fifties, kept more signs of her
femininity than my mother.  Although her jackets still in the
traditional style all became the same color of pale gray, she took
particular care of her long, thick black hair.  According to Chinese
tradition, which the Communists inherited, hair had to be well above
the shoulder for women of middle age, meaning over thirty.

My grandmother kept her hair tied up in a neat bun at the back of her
head, but she always had flowers there, sometimes a pair of
ivory-colored magnolias, and sometimes a white Cape jasmine cupped by
two dark-green leaves, which set off her lustrous hair.  She never used
shampoo from the shops, which she thought would make her hair dull and
dry, but would boil the fruit of the Chinese honey locust and use the
liquid from that.  She would rub the fruit to produce a perfumed
lather, and slowly let her mass of black hair drop into the shiny,
white, slithery liquid.  She soaked her wooden combs in the juice of
pomelo seeds, so that the comb ran smoothly through her hair, and gave
it a faint aroma.  She added a final touch by putting on a little water
of osmanthus flowers which she made herself, as perfume had begun to
disappear from the shops.  I remember watching her combing her hair. It
was the only thing over which she took her time.  She did everything
else very swiftly.  She would also paint her eyebrows lightly with a
black charcoal pencil and dab a little powder on her nose.  Remembering
her eyes smiling into the mirror with a particular kind of intense
concentration, I think these must have been among her most pleasurable
moments.

Watching her doing her face was strange, even though I had been
watching her do it since I was a baby.  The women in books and films
who made themselves up now were invariably wicked characters, like
concubines.  I vaguely knew something about my beloved grandmother
having been a concubine, but I was learning to live with contradictory
thoughts and realities, and getting used to compartmentalizing them.
When I went out shopping with my grandmother, I began to realize that
she was different from other people, with her makeup, no matter how
discreet, and the flowers in her hair.  People noticed her.

She walked proudly, her figure erect, with a restrained
self-consciousness.

She could get away with it because she lived in the compound.  If she
had been living outside, she would have fallen under one of the
residents' committees, which supervised the lives of any adult who did
not have a job and so did not belong to a work unit.  The committees
usually contained retired men and old housewives, and some of them
became notorious for minding other people's business and throwing their
weight around.  Had my grandmother been under one of these, she would
have received disapproving hints or open criticism.  But the compound
had no committee.  She did have to go to a meeting once a week with
other parents-in-law and maids and nannies from the compound, to be
told about Party policies, but she was mainly left alone.  Actually,
she enjoyed the meetings; they were a chance to chat with the other
women and she always came home beaming with the latest gossip.

Politics invaded my life more and more after I went to middle school in
the autumn of 1964.  On our first day we were told we should thank
Chairman Mao for being there, because his 'class line' had been applied
to our year's enrollment.  Mao had accused schools and universities of
having taken in too many children of the bourgeoisie.  Now, he had
instructed, priority should be given to sons and daughters of 'good
backgrounds' (chu-shen hao).  This meant having workers, peasants,
soldiers, or Party officials as parents, particularly as fathers.  The
application of this 'class-line' criterion to the whole society meant
that one's lot was more than ever determined by one's family and the
accident of birth.

However, the status of a family was often ambiguous: a worker might
once have been employed in a Kuomintang office; a clerk did not belong
to any category; an intellectual was an 'undesirable," but what if he
was a Party member?

How should the children of such parents be classified?

Many enrollment officers decided to play it safe, which meant giving
preference to children whose parents were Party officials.  They
constituted half the pupils in my class.

My new school, the Number Four Middle School, was the leading key
school for the whole province and took students with the highest marks
in the all-Sichuan entrance exams.  In previous years, entrance had
been decided solely on the basis of exam results.  In my year, exam
marks and family background were equally important.

In the two exam papers, I got 100 percent for math and an unusual 100
percent 'plus' for Chinese.  My father had constantly drummed it into
me that I should not rely on my parents' name, and I did not like the
suggestion that the 'class line' had helped me get into the school. But
I soon thought no more about it.  If this was what Chairman Mao said,
it must be good.

It was in this period that 'high officials' children' (gaogan zi-dO
became almost a stratum of their own.  They developed an air which
identified them unmistakably as members of an elite group, exuding an
awareness of powerful backing and untouchability.  Many high officials'
children now grew more arrogant and haughty than ever, and from Mao
downward concern was constantly being expressed about their behavior.
It became a recurrent theme in the press.  All this only reinforced the
idea that they were a special group.

My father frequently warned us against this air and against forming
cliques with other children of high officials.  The result was that I
had few friends, as I seldom met children from any other background.
When I did come into contact with them, I found we had been so
conditioned by the importance of family background and the lack of
shared experience that we seemed to have little in common with each
other.

When I entered the new school two teachers came to see my parents to
ask which foreign language they wanted me to learn.  They chose English
rather than Russian, which was the only other option.  The teachers
also wanted to know whether I was going to take physics or chemistry in
my first year.  My parents said they would leave that up to the
school.

I loved the school from the moment I walked in.  It had an imposing
gate with a broad roof of blue tiles and carved caves.  A flight of
stone stairs led up to it, and the loggia was supported by six
red-timber columns.  Symmetrical rows of dark-green cypresses enhanced
the atmosphere of solemnity leading into the interior.

The school had been founded in 14 18 BC.  It was the first school set
up by a local government in China.  At its center was a magnificent
temple, formerly dedicated to Confucius.  It was well preserved, but
was not functioning as a temple any longer.  Inside were half a dozen
ping-pong tables, separated by the massive columns.  In front of the
carved doors, down a long flight of stairs, lay extensive grounds
designed to provide a majestic approach to the temple.  A two-story
teaching block had been erected, which cut off the grounds from a brook
crossed by three little arched bridges, with sculptures of miniature
lions and other animals sitting on their sandstone edges.  Beyond the
bridges was a beautiful garden surrounded by peaches and plane trees.
Two giant bronze incense burners were set at the bottom of the stairs
in front of the temple, although there was no longer any blue smoke
curling up and lingering in the air above them.  The grounds on the
sides of the temple had been converted into basketball and volleyball
courts.  Farther along were two lawns where we used to sit or lie in
spring and enjoy the sun during lunch breaks.

Behind the temple was another lawn, beyond which lay a big orchard at
the foot of a small hill covered with trees, vines, and herbs.

Dotted around were laboratories where we studied biology and chemistry,
learned to use microscopes, and dissected dead animals.  In the lecture
theaters, we watched teaching films.  For after-school activities, I
joined the biology group which strolled around the hill and the back
garden with the teacher learning the names and characteristics of the
different plants.  There were temperaturecontrolled breeding cases for
us to observe how tadpoles and ducklings broke out of their eggs.  In
spring, the school was a sea of pink because of all the peach trees.
But what I liked most was the two-story library, built in the
traditional Chinese style.  The building was encircled on both floors
by loggias, and the outside of these was enclosed by a row of
gorgeously painted seats which were shaped like wings.

I had a favorite corner in these 'wing seats' (fei-lai-yO where I used
to sit for hours reading, occasionally stretching my arm out to touch
the fan-shaped leaves of a rare ginkgo tree.  There was a pair of them
outside the front gate of the library, towering and elegant.  They were
the only sight that could distract me from my books.

My clearest memory is of my teachers.  They were the best in their
field; many were grade one, or special grade.

Their classes were sheer joy, and I could never have enough of them.

But more and more political indoctrination was creeping into school
life.  Gradually, morning assembly became devoted to Mao's teachings,
and special sessions were instituted in which we read Party documents.
Our Chineselanguage textbook now contained more propaganda and less
classical literature, and politics, which mainly consisted of works by
Mao, became part of' the curriculum.

Almost every activity became politicized.  One day at morning assembly
the headmaster told us we were going to do eye exercises.  He said
Chairman Mao had observed that there were too many schoolchildren
wearing spectacles, a sign that they had hurt their eyes by working too
hard.  He had ordered something to be done about it.  We were all
terribly moved by his concern.  Some of us wept with gratitude.  We
started doing eye exercises for fifteen minutes every morning.  A set
of movements had been devised by doctors and set to music.  After
rubbing various points around our eyes, we all stared intently at the
rows of poplars and willows outside the window.  Green was supposed to
be a restful color.  As I enjoyed the comfort the exercises and the
leaves brought me, I thought of Mao and repledged my loyalty to him.

A repeated theme was that we must not allow China to 'change color,"
which meant going from Communist to capitalist.  The split between
China and the Soviet Union, which had been kept secret at first, had
burst into the open in early 1963.  We were told that since Khrushchev
had come to power after the death of Stalin in 1953 the Soviet Union
had surrendered to international capitalism, and that Russian children
had been reduced to suffering and misery again, just like Chinese
children under the Kuomintang.  One day, after warning us for the
umpteenth time against the road taken by Russia, our politics teacher
said: "If you aren't careful, our country will change color gradually,
first from bright red to faded red, then to gray, then to black."  It
so happened that the Sichuan expression 'faded red' had exactly the
same pronunciation (er-hong) as my name.

My classmates giggled, and I could see them stealing glances at me.  I
felt I must get rid of my name immediately.  That evening I begged my
father to give me another name.  He suggested Zhang, meaning both
'prose' and 'coming into one's own early," which expressed his desire
for me to become a good writer at a young age.

But I did not want the name.  I told my father that I wanted 'something
with a military ring to it."  Many of my friends had changed their
names to incorporate the characters meaning 'army' or 'soldier."  My
father's choice reflected his classical learning.  My new name, Jung
(pronounced "Yung'), was a very old and recondite word for 'martial
affairs' which appeared only in classical poetry and a few antiquated
phrases.  It evoked an image of bygone battles between knights in
shining armor, with tasseled spears and neighing steeds.  When I turned
up at school with my new name even some teachers could not recognize
the character $1.

At this time Mao had called on the country to go from learning from Lei
Feng to learning from the army.  Under the defense minister, Lin Biao,
who had succeeded Marshal Peng Dehuai in 1959, the army had become the
trailblazer for the cult of Mao.  Mao also wanted to regimentalize the
nation even more.  He had just written a well-publicized poem exhorting
women to 'doff feminini~ and don military attire."  We were told that
the Americans were waiting for a chance to invade and reinstate the
Kuomintang, and that in order to defeat an invasion by them Lei Feng
had trained day and night to overcome his weak physique and become a
champion hand-grenade thrower.

Physical training suddenly assumed vital importance.

There was compulsory running, swimming, high jumping, working out on
parallel bars, shot-punning, and throwing wooden hand grenades.  In
addition to the two hours of sports per week, forty-five minutes of
after-school sports now became obligatory.

I had always been hopeless at sports, and hated them, except tennis.
Previously this had not mannered, but now it took on a political
connotation, with slogans like: "Build up a strong physique to defend
our motherland."  Unfortunately, my aversion to sports was increased by
this pressure.  When I tried to swim, I always had a mental picture of
being pursued by invading Americans to the bank of a surging river.  As
I could not swim, my only choice was between being drowned or being
captured and tortured by the Americans.  Fear gave me frequent cramps
in the water, and once I thought I was drowning in the swimming pool.

In spite of compulsory swimming every week during the summer, I never
managed to learn to swim all the time I lived in China.

Hand-grenade throwing was also regarded as very important, for obvious
reasons.  I was always at the bottom of the class.  I could only throw
the wooden hand grenades we practised with a couple of yards.  I felt
that my classmates were questioning my resolve to fight the US

imperialists.  Once at our weekly political meeting somebody commented
on my persistent failure at hand-grenade throwing.  I could feel the
eyes of the class boring into me like needles, as if to say: "You are a
lackey of the Americans!"  The next morning I went and stood in a
corner of the sports field, with my arms held out in front of me and a
couple of bricks in each hand.  In Lei Feng's diary, which I had
learned by heart, I had read that this was how he had toughened up his
muscles to throw hand grenades.

After a few days, by which time my upper arms were red and swollen, I
gave up, and whenever I was handed the wooden chunk, I became so
nervous that my hands shook uncontrollably.

One day in 1965, we were suddenly told to go out and start removing all
the grass from the lawns.  Mao had instructed that grass, flowers, and
pets were bourgeois habits and were to be eliminated.  The grass in the
lawns at our school was of a type I have not seen anywhere outside
China.  Its name in Chinese means 'bound to the ground."  It crawls all
over the hard surface of the earth and spreads thousands of roots which
drill down into the soil like claws of steel.  Underground they open up
and produce further roots which shoot out in every direction.

In no time there are two networks, one aboveground and one below ground
which intertwine and cling to the earth, like knotted metal wires that
have been nailed into the ground.  Often the only casualties were my
fingers, which always ended up with deep, long cuts.  It was only when
they were attacked with hoes and spades that some of the root systems
went, reluctantly.  But any fragment left behind would make a
triumphant comeback after even a slight rise in temperature or a gentle
drizzle, and we would have to go into battle all over again.

Flowers were much easier to deal with, but they went with even more
difficulty, because no one wanted to remove them.  Mao had attacked
flowers and grass several times before, saying that they should be
replaced by cab

The Cult q lao 35~;

bales and cotton.  But only now was he able to generate enough pressure
to get his order implemented but only~ up to a point.  People loved
their plants, and some flowerbeds survived Mao's campaign.

I was extremely sad to see the lovely plants go.  But I did not resent
Mao.  On the contrary, I hated myself for feeling miserable.  By then I
had grown into the habit of self criticism and automatically blamed
myself for any instincts that went against Mao's instructions.  In
fact, such feelings frightened me.  It was out of the question to
discuss them with anyone.  Instead, I tried to suppress them and
acquire the correct way of thinking.  I lived in a state of constant
self-accusation.

Such self-examination and self-criticism were a feature of Mao's China.
You would become a new and better person, we were told.  But all this
introspection was really designed to serve no other purpose than to
create a people who had no thoughts of their own.

The religious aspect of the Mao cult would not have been possible in a
traditionally secular society like China had there not been impressive
economic achievements.

The country had made a stunning recovery from the famine, and the
standard of living was improving dramatically.  In Chengdu, although
rice was still rationed, there was plenty of meat, poultry, and
vegetables.  Winter melons, turnips, and eggplants were piled up on the
pavements outside the shops because there was not enough space to store
them.  They were left outside overnight, and almost nobody took them;
the shops were giving them away for a pittance.  Eggs, once so
precious, sat rotting in large baskets there were too many of them.
Only a few years before it had been hard to find a single peach now
peach eating was being promoted as 'patriotic," and officials went
around to people's homes and tried to persuade them to take peaches for
next to nothing.

There were a number of success stories which boosted the nation's
pride.  In October 1964 China exploded its first atomic bomb.  This was
given huge publicity and touted as a demonstration of the country's
scientific and industrial achievement, particularly in relation to
'standing up to imperialist bullies."  The explosion of the atomic bomb
coincided with the ousting of Khrushchev, which was presented as proof
that Mao was right again.  In 1964 France recognized China at full
ambassadorial level, the first leading Western nation to do so.  This
was received with rapture inside China as a major victory over the
United States, which was refusing to acknowledge China's rightful place
in the world.

In addition, there was no general political persecution, and people
were relatively content.  All the credit was given to Mao.  Although
the very top leaders knew what Mao's real contribution was, the people
were kept completely in the dark.  Over the years I composed passionate
eulogies thanking Mao for all his achievements and pledging my undying
loyalty to him.

I was thirteen in 1965.  On the evening of I October that year, the
sixteenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, there
was a big fireworks display on the square in the center of Chengdu.  To
the north of the square was the gate to an ancient imperial palace,
which had recently been restored to its third-century grandeur, when
Chengdu was the capital of a kingdom and a prosperous warlord city. 
The gate was very similar to the Gate of Heavenly Peace in Peking, now
the entrance to the Forbidden City, except for its color: it had
sweeping green tiled roofs and gray walls.  Under the glazed roof of
the pavilion stood enormous dark-red pillars.  The balustrades were
made of white marble.  I was standing behind them with my family and
the Sichuan dignitaries on a reviewing stand enjoying the festival
atmosphere and waiting for the fireworks to begin.  Below in the square
50,000 people were singing and dancing.  Bang.  t Bang.t The signals
for the fireworks went off a few yards from where I stood.  In an
instant, the sky was a garden of spectacular shapes and

The Cult of Mao 36I colors, a sea of wave after wave of brilliance. The
music and noise rose from below the imperial gate to join in the
sumptuousness.  After a while, the sky was clear for a few seconds.
Then a sudden explosion brought out a gorgeous blossom, followed by the
unfurling of a long, vast, silky hanging.  It stretched itself in the
middle of the sky, swaying gently in the autumn breeze.  In the light
over the square, the characters on the hanging were shining: "Long Live
Our Great Leader Chairman Mao!"  Tears sprang to my eyes.

"How lucky, how incredibly lucky I am to be living in the great era of
Mao Zedong!"  I kept saying to myself.

"How can children in the capitalist world go on living without being
near Chairman Mao, and without the hope of ever seeing him in person?"
I wanted to do something for them, to rescue them from their plight.  I
made a pledge to myself there and then to work hard to build a stronger
China, in order to support a world revolution.  I needed to work hard
to be entitled to see Chairman Mao, too.  That was the purpose of my
life.

15.  "Destroy First, and

Construction Will

Look After Itself'-The Cultural Revolution Begins

(1965-1966)

At the beginning of the 1960s, in spite of all the disasters Mao had
caused, he was still China's supreme leader, idololized by the
population.  But because the pragmatists were actually running the
country, there was relative literary and artistic freedom.  A host of
plays, operas, films, and novels emerged after long hibernation.  None
attacked the Party openly, and contemporary themes were rare.  At this
time Mao was on the defensive, and he turned more and more to his wife,
Jiang Qjng, who had been an actress in the 193OS.  They decided that
historical themes were being used to convey insinuations against the
regime and against Mao himself.

In China, there was a strong tradition of using historical allusion to
voice opposition, and even apparently esoteric allusions were widely
understood as coded references to the present day.  In April 1963 Mao
banned all "Ghost Dramas," a genre rich in ancient tales of revenge by
dead victims' spirits on those who had persecuted them.  To him, these
ghost avengers were uncomfortably close to the class enemies who had
perished under his rule.

The Maos also turned their attention to another genre, the "Dramas of
the Ming Mandarin," the protagonist of which was Hai Rui, a mandarin
from the Ming dynasty (1368-1644).  A famous personification of justice
and courage, the Ming Mandarin remonstrated with the emperor on behalf
of the suffering ordinary people, at the risk of his own life.  He was
dismissed and exiled.  The Maos suspected that the Ming Mandarin was
being used to represent Marshal Peng Dehuai, the former defense
minister who in 1959 had spoken out against Mao's disastrous policies
which had caused the famine.  Almost immediately after Peng's
dismissal, there was a noticeable resurgence of the Ming Mandarin
genre.  Mme Mao tried to get the plays denounced, but when she
approached the writers and ministers in charge of the arts they turned
a deaf ear.

In 1964, Mao drew up a list of thirty-nine artists, writers, and
scholars for denunciation.  He branded them 'reactionary bourgeois
authorities," a new category of class enemies.

Prominent names on the list included the most famous playwright in the
Ming Mandarin genre, Wu Han, and Professor Ma Yin-chu, who had been the
first leading economist to advocate birth control.  For this he had
already been named a rightist in 1957.  Mao had subsequently realized
that birth control was necessary, but he resented Professor Ma for
showing him up and making it clear that he was wrong.

The list was not made public, and the thirty-nine people were not
purged by their Party organizations.  Mao had the list circulated to
officials down to my mother's level with instructions to catch other
'reactionary bourgeois authorities."  In the winter of 1964-65, my
mother was sent as the head of a work team to a school named "Ox
Market."

She was told to look for suspects among prominent

teachers and those who had written books or articles.

My mother was appalled, particularly as the purge threatened the very
people she most admired.  Besides, she could plainly see that even if
she were to look for 'enemies' she would not find any.  Apart from
anything else, with the memory of all the recent persecutions few had
dared to open their mouths at all.  She told her superior, Mr.  Pao,
who was in charge of the campaign in Chengdu, how she felt.

Nineteen sixty-five passed, and my mother did nothing.

Mr.  Pao did not exert any pressure on her.  Their inaction reflected
the general mood among Party officials.  Most of them were fed up with
persecutions, and wanted to get on with improving living standards and
building a normal life.

But they did not openly oppose Mao, and indeed went on promoting his
personality cult.  The few who watched Mao's deification with
apprehension knew there was nothing they could do to stop it: Mao had
such power and prestige that his cult was irresistible.  The most they
could do was engage in some kind of passive resistance.

Mao interpreted the reaction from the Party officials to his call for a
witch-hunt as an indication that their loyalty to him was weakening and
that their hearts were with the policies being pursued by President Liu
and Deng.  His suspicion was confirmed when the Party newspapers
refused to publish an article he had authorized denouncing Wu Han and
his play about the Ming Mandarin.  Mao's purpose in getting the article
published was to involve the population in the witch-hunt.  Now he
found he was cut off from his subjects by the Party system, which had
been the intermediary between himself and the people.  He had, in
effect, lost control.  The Party Committee of Peking, where Wu Han was
deputy mayor, and the Central Department of Public Affairs, which
looked after the media and the arts, stood up to Mao, refusing either
to denounce Wu Han or to dismiss him.

Mao felt threatened.  He saw himself as a Stalin figure,

about to be denounced by a Khrushchev while he was still alive.  He
wanted to make a preemptive strike and destro~ the man he regarded as
"China's Khrushchev," Liu Shaoqi, and his colleague Deng, as well as
their followers in the Party.  This he deceptively termed the "Cultural
Revolution."  He knew his would be a lone battle, but this gave him the
majestic satisfaction of feeling that he was challenging nothing less
than the whole world, and maneuvering on a grand scale.  There was even
a tinge of self-pity as he portrayed himself as the tragic hero taking
on a mighty enemy the huge Party machine.

On io November ,965, having repeatedly failed to have the article
condemning Wu Han's play published in Peking, Mao was at last able to
get it printed in Shanghai, where his followers were in charge.  It was
in this article that the term "Cultural Revolution' first appeared. The
Party's own newspaper, the People's Daily, refused to reprint the
article, as did the Peking Daily, the voice of the Party organization
in the capital.  In the provinces, some papers did carry the article.
At the time, my father was overseeing the provincial Party newspaper,
the Sichuan Daily, and was against reprinting the article, which he
could sense was an attack on Marshal Peng and a call for a witch-hunt.
He went to see the man in charge of cultural affairs for the province,
who suggested they telephone Deng Xiaoping.  Deng was not in his
office, and the call was taken by Marshal Ho Lung, a close friend of
Deng's, and a member of the Politburo.  It was he whom my father had
overheard saying in 1959: "It really should be him [Deng] on the
throne."  Ho said not to reprint the article.

Sichuan was one of the last provinces to run the article, doing so only
on 18 December, well after the People's Daily finally printed it on 30
November.  The article appeared in the People's Daily only after Zhou
Enlai, the premier, who had emerged as the peacekeeper in the power
struggle, added a note to it, in the name of 'the editor," saying that
the Cultural Revolution was to be an 'academic' discussion,

meaning that it should be nonpolitical and should not lead to political
condemnations.

Over the next three months there was intense maneuvering, with Mao's
opponents, as well as Zhou, trying to head off Mao's witch-hunt.  In
February 1966, while Mao was away from Peking, the Politburo passed a
resolution that 'academic discussions' must not degenerate into
persecutions.  Mao had objected to this resolution, but he was
ignored.

In April my father was asked to prepare a document in the spirit of the
Politburo's February resolution to guide the Cultural Revolution in
Sichuan.  What he wrote became known as the "April Document."  It said:
The debates must be strictly academic.  No wild accusations should be
allowed.  Everyone is equal before the truth.  The Party must not use
force to suppress intellectuals.

Just as this document was about to be published in May, it was suddenly
blocked.  There was a new Politburo decision.  This time, Mao had been
present and had got the upper hand, with Zhou Enlai's complicity.  Mao
tore up the February resolution and declared that all dissident
scholars and their ideas must be 'eliminated."  He emphasized that it
was officials in the Communist Party who had been protecting the
dissident scholars and other class enemies.  He termed these officials
'those in power following the capitalist road," and declared war on
them.  They became known as 'capitalist-roaders."  The mammoth Cultural
Revolution was formally launched.

Who exactly were these 'capitalist-roaders'?  Mao himself was not sure.
He knew he wanted to replace the whole of the Peking Party Committee,
which he did.  He also knew he wanted to get rid of Liu Shaoqi and Deng
Xiaoping, and 'the bourgeois headquarters in the Party."  But he did
not know who in the vast Party system were loyal to him and who were
followers of Liu and Deng and their 'capitalist road."  He calculated
that he controlled only a third of the Party.  In order not to let a
single one of his enemies escape, he resolved to overthrow the entire
Communist Party.  Those faithful to him would survive the upheaval.  In
his own words: "Destroy first, and construction will look after
itself."  Mao was not worried about the possible destruction of the
Party: Mao the Emperor always overrode Mao the Communist.  Nor was he
fainthearted about hurting anyone unduly, even those most loyal to
him.

One of his great heroes, the ancient general Tsao Tsao, had spoken an
immortal line which Mao openly admired:

"I would rather wrong all people under Heaven; and no one under Heaven
must ever wrong me."  The general proclaimed this when he discovered
that he had murdered an elderly couple by mistake the old man and
woman, whom he had suspected of betraying him, had in fact saved his
life.

Mao's vague bat He calls threw the population and the majority of Party
officials into profound confusion.  Few knew what he was driving at, or
who exactly were the enemies this time.  My father and mother, like
other senior Party people, could see that Mao had decided to punish
some officials.  But they had no idea who these would be.  It could
well be themselves.  Apprehension and bewilderment overwhelmed them.

Meanwhile, Mao made his single most important organizational move: he
set up his own personal chain of command that operated outside the
Party apparatus, although by formally claiming it was under the
Politburo and the Central Committee he was able to pretend it was
acting on Party orders.

First, he picked as his deputy Marshal Lin Biao, who had succeeded Peng
Dehuai as defense minister in 1959 and had greatly boosted Mao's
personality cult in the armed forces.  He also set up a new body, the
Cultural Revolution Authority, under his former secretary Chen Boda,
with his intelligence chief Kang Sheng and Mme Mao as its de facto
leaders.  It became the core of the leadership of the Cultural
Revolution.

368 "Destroy First, and Construction Will Look After Itself'

Next, Mao moved in on the media, primarily the People's Daily, which
carried the most authority as it was the official Party newspaper and
the population had become accustomed to it being the voice of the
regime.  He appointed Chen Boda to take it over on 3I May, thus
securing a channel through which he could speak directly to hundreds of
millions of Chinese.

Starting in June 1966, the People's Daily showered the country with one
strident editorial after another, calling for 'establishing Chairman
Mao's absolute authority," 'sweeping away all the ox devils and snake
demons' (class enemies), and exhorting people to follow Mao and join
the vast, unprecedented undertaking of a Cultural Revolution.

In my school, teaching stopped completely from the beginning of June,
though we had to continue to go there.

Loudspeakers blasted out People's Daily editorials, and the front page
of the newspaper, which we had to study every day, was frequently taken
up entirely by a full-page portrait of Mao.  There was a daily column
of Mao's quotations.  I still remember the slogans in bold type, which,
through reading in class over and over again, were engraved into the
deepest folds of my brain: "Chairman Mao is the red sun in our
hearts!"

"Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline!"

"We will smash whoever opposes Chairman Mao!"

"People all over the world love our Great Leader Chairman Mao!"

There were pages of worshipping comments from foreigners, and pictures
of European crowds trying to grab Mao's works.  Chinese national pride
was being mobilized to enhance his cult.

The daily newspaper reading soon gave way to the recitation and
memorizing of The Quotations of Chairman Mao, which were collected
together in a pocket-size book with a red plastic cover, known as "The
Little Red Book."  Everyone was given a copy and told to cherish it
'like our eyes."

Every day we chanted passages from it over and over again in unison.  I
still remember many verbatim.

One day, we read in the People's Daily that an old peasant had stuck
thirty-two portraits of Mao on his bedroom walls, 'so that he can see
Chairman Mao's face as soon as he opens his eyes, whatever direction he
looks in."  So we covered the walls of our classroom with pictures of
Mao's face beaming his most benign smile.  But we soon had to take them
down, and quickly, too.  Word circulated that the peasant had really
used the pictures as wallpaper, because Mao's portraits were printed on
the best-quality paper and were free.  Rumour had it that the reporter
who had written up the story had been found to be a class enemy for
advocaring 'abuse of Chairman Mao."  For the first time, fear of
Chairman Mao entered my subconscious.

Like "Ox Market," my school had a work team stationed in it.  The team
had hal heartedly branded several of the school's best teachers as
'reactionary bourgeois authorities," but had kept this from the pupils.
In June 1966, however, panicked at the tide of the" Cultur:,l
Revolution and feeling the need to create some victims, the work team
suddenly announced the names of the accused to the whole school.

The work team organized pupils and the teachers who had not been
accused to write denunciation posters and slogans, which soon covered
the grounds.  Teachers became active for a variety of reasons:
conformity, loyalty to the Party's orders, envy of the prestige and
privileges of other teachers and fear.

Among the victims was my Chinese language and literature teacher, Mr.
Chi, whom I adored.  According to one of the wall posters, he had said
in the early 1960s: "Shouting "Long live the Great Leap Forward!"  will
not fill our stomachs, will it?"  Having no idea that the Great Leap
had caused the famine, I did not understand his alleged remark,
although I could catch its irreverent tone.

There was something about Mr.  Chi which set him apart.

At the time I could not put my finger on it, but now I think it was
that he had an air of irony about him.  He had a way of making dry,
short half-cough, half-laughs which suggested he had kept something
unsaid.  He once made this noise in response to a ques6 on I asked him.
One lesson in our textbook was an extract from the memoirs of Lu
Dingyi, the then head of Central Public Affairs, about his experience
on the Long March.  Mr.  Chi drew our attention to a vivid description
of the troops marching along a zigzagging mountain path, the whole
procession lit up by pine torches carried by the marchers, the flames
glowing against a moonless black sky.  When they reached their night's
destination, they all 'rushed to grab a bowlful of food to pour down
their stomachs."  This puzzled me profoundly, as Red Army soldiers had
always been described as offering their last mouthful to their comrades
and going starving themselves.  It was impossible to imagine them
'grabbing."  I went to Mr.  Chi for an answer.  He cough laughed said I
did not know what being hungry meant, and quickly changed the subject.
I was unconvinced.

In spite of this, I felt the greatest respect for Mr.  Chi.  It broke
my heart to see him, and other teachers I admired, being wildly
condemned and called ugly names.  I hated it when the work team asked
everyone in the school to write wall posters 'exposing and denouncing'
them.

I was fourteen at the time, instincfvely averse to all militant
activities, and I did not know what to write.  I was frightened of the
wall posters' overwhelming black ink on giant white sheets of paper,
and the outlandish and violent language, such as "Smash So-and-so's
dog's head' and "Annihilate So-and-so if he does not surrender."  I
began to play truant and stay at home.  For this I was constantly
criticized for 'putting family first' at the endless meetings that now
made up almost our entire school life.  I dreaded these meetings.  A
sense of unpredictable danger haunted me.

One day my deputy headmaster, Mr.  Kan, a jolly, energetic man, was
accused of being a capitalist-roader and of protecting the condemned
teachers.  Everything he had done in the school over the years was said
to be 'capitalist,"

The Cultural Revolution Begins 37 i even studying Mao's works as fewer
hours had been devoted to this than to academic studies.

I was equally shocked to see the cheerful secretary of the Communist
Youth League in the school, Mr.  Shan, being accused of being
'anti-Chairman Mao."  He was a dashing-looking young man whose
attention I had been eager to attract, as he might help me join the
Youth League when I reached the minimum age, fifteen.

He had been teaching a course on Marxist philosophy to the sixteen- to
eighteen-year-olds, and had given them some essay-writing assignments.
He had underlined bits of the essays which he thought were particularly
well written.  Now these disconnected parts were joined together by his
pupils to form an obviously nonsensical passage which the wall posters
claimed was anti-Mao.  I learned years later that this method of
concocting an accusation through the arbitrary linking of unconnected
sentences had started as early as 1955, the year my mother suffered her
first detention under the Communists, when some writers had used it to
attack their fellow writers.

Mr.  Shan told me years later that the real reason he and the deputy
headmaster were picked out as victims was that they were not around at
the time they had been absent as members of another work team which
made them convenient scapegoats.  The fact that they did not get on
with the headmaster, who had stayed behind, made things worse.

"If we'd been there and he'd been away, that son of a turtle wouldn't
have been able to pull his pants up, he would have had so much shit on
his arse," Mr.  Shan told me ruefully.

The deputy headmaster, Mr.  Kan, had been devoted to the Party, and
felt terribly wronged.  One evening he wrote a suicide note and then
slashed his throat with a razor.  He was rushed to hospital by his
wife, who had come home earlier than usual.  The work team hushed up
his suicide attempt.  For a Party member like Mr.  Kan to commit
suicide was regarded as a betrayal.  It was seen as a loss of faith in
the Party and an attempt at blackmail.  Therefore, no mercy should be
shown to the unfortunate person.  But the work team was nervous.  They
knew very well that they had been inventing victims without the
slightest justification.

When my mother was told about Mr.  Kan she cried.  She liked him very
much, and knew that as he was a man of immense optimism he must have
been under inhuman pressure to have acted in this way.

In her own school, my mother refused to be swept into any panic
victimizing.  But the teenagers in the school, stirred up by the
articles in the People's Daily, began to move against their teachers.
The People's Daily called for 'smashing up' the examination system
which 'treated pupils like enemies' (quoting Mao) and was part of the
vicious designs of the 'bourgeois intellectuals," meaning the majority
of the teachers (again quoting Mao).  The paper also denounced
'bourgeois intellectuals' for poisoning the minds of the young with
capitalist rubbish in preparation for a Kuomintang comeback.

"We cannot allow bourgeois intellectuals to dominate our schools
anymore!"  said Mao.

One day my mother bicycled to the school to find that the pupils had
rounded up the headmaster, the academic supervisor, the graded
teachers, whom they understood from the official press to be
'reactionary bourgeois authorities," and any other teachers they
disliked.  They had shut them all up in a classroom and put a notice on
the door saying 'demons' class."  The teachers had let them do it
because the Cultural Revolution had thrown them into bewilderment.  The
pupils now seemed to have some sort of authorization, undefined but
nonetheless real.  The grounds were covered with giant slogans, mostly
headlines from the People's Daily.

As my mother was shown to the classroom now turned 'prison," she passed
through a crowd of pupils.  Some looked fierce, some ashamed, some
worried, and others uncertain.  More pupils had been following her from
the moment she arrived.  As the leader of the work team, she had
supreme authority, and was identified with the Part)'.

The pupils looked to her for orders.  Having set up the 'prison," they
had no idea what to do next.

My mother announced forcefully that the 'demons' class' was dismissed.
There was a stir among the pupils, but nobody challenged her order.  A
few boys muttered to one another, but lapsed into silence when my
mother asked them to speak out.  She went on to tell them that it was
illegal to detain anyone without authorization, and that they should
not ill-treat their teachers, who deserved their gratitude and respect.
The door to the classroom was opened and the 'prisoners' set free.

My mother was very brave to go against the tide.  Many other work teams
engaged in victimizing completely innocent people to save their own
skins.  In fact, she had more cause than most to worry.  The provincial
authorities had already punished several scapegoats, and my father had
a strong presentiment that he was going to be the next in line.  A
couple of his colleagues had told him discreetly that the word was
going around in some organizations under him that they should turn
their suspicion on him.

My parents never said anything to me or my siblings.

The restraints which had kept them silent about politics before still
prevented them from opening their minds to us.  Now it was even less
possible for them to speak.  The situation was so complex and confusing
that they could not understand it themselves.  What could they possibly
say to us that would make us understand?  And what use would it have
been anyway?  There was nothing anyone could do.

What was more, knowledge itself was dangerous.  As a result, my
siblings and I were totally unprepared for the Cultural Revolution,
although we had a vague feeling of impending catastrophe.

In this atmosphere, August came.  All of a sudden, like a storm
sweeping across China, millions of Red Guards emerged.

16.  "Soar to Heaven, and Pierce the Earth'~

Mao's Red Guards June-August 1966)

Under Mao a generation of teenagers grew up expecting to fight class
enemies, and the vague calls in the press for a Cultural Revolution had
stoked the feeling that a 'war' was imminent.  Some politically
well-attuned youngsters sensed that their idol, Mao, was directly
involved, and their indoctrination gave them no alternative but to take
his side.

By the beginning of June a few activists from a middle school attached
to one of China's most renowned universities, qmghua in Peking, had got
together several times to discuss their strategies for the forthcoming
battle and had decided to call themselves 'the Red Guards of Chairman
Mao."  They adopted a quotation by Mao that had appeared in the
People's Daily, "Rebellion is justified," as their motto.

These early Red Guards were 'high officials' children."

Only they could feel sufficiently secure to engage in activities of
this kind.  In addition, they had been brought up in a political
environment, and were more interested in political intrigues than most
Chinese.  Mme Mao noticed them, and gave them an audience in July.  On
x August, Mao made the unusual gesture of writing them an open letter
to offer his 'most warm and fiery support."  In the letter he subtly
modified his earlier saying to "Rebellion against reactionaries is
justified."  To the teenage zealots, this was like being addressed by
God.  After this, Red Guard groups sprang up all over Peking, and then
throughout China.

Mao wanted the Red Guards to be his shock troops.  He could see that
the people were not responding to his repeated calls to attack the
capitalist-roaders.  The Communist Party had a sizable constituency,
and, moreover, the lesson of 1957 was also still fresh in people's
minds.

Then, too, Mao had called on the population to criticize Party
officials, but those who had taken up his invitation had ended up being
labeled as rightists and had been damned.  Most people suspected the
same tactic again 'enticing the snake out of its haunt in order to cut
off its head."

If he was to get the population to act, Mao would have to remove
authority from the Party and establish absolute loyalty and obedience
to himself alone.  To achieve this he needed terror an intense terror
that would block all other considerations and crush all other fears. He
saw boys and girls in their teens and early twenties as his ideal
agents.

They had been brought up in the fanatical personality cult of Mao and
the militant doctrine of' class struggle."  They were endowed with the
qualities of youth- they were rebellious, fearless, eager to fight for
a 'just cause," thirsty for adventure and action.  They were also
irresponsible, ignorant, and easy to manipulate and prone to violence.
Only they could give Mao the immense force that he needed to terrorize
the whole society, and to create a chaos that would shake, and then
shatter, the foundation of the Party.  One slogan summed up the Red
Guards' mission: "We vow to launch a bloody war against anyone who
dares to resist the Cultural Revolution, who dares to oppose Chairman
Mao!"

All policies and orders had hitherto been conveyed through a tightly
controlled system which was entirely in

376 "Soar to Heaven, and Pierce the Earth' the hands of the Party.  Mao
now discarded this channel and turned directly to the masses of the
youth.  He did this by combining two quite different methods: vague,
high flown rhetoric carried openly in the press; and conspirao to rial
manipulation and agitation conducted by the Cultural Revolution
Authority, particularly his wife.  It was they who filled out the real
meaning of the rhetoric.  Phrases like 'rebellion against authority,"
'revolution in education," 'destroying an old world so a new one could
be born," and 'creating new man' all of which attracted many in the
West in the 1960s were interpreted as calls for violent action.  Mao
understood the latent violence of the young, and said that since they
were well fed and had had their lessons stopped, they could easily be
stirred up and use their boundless energy to go out and wreak havoc.

To arouse the young to controlled mob violence, victims were necessary.
The most conspicuous targets in any school were the teachers, some of
whom had already been victimized by work teams and school authorities
in the last few months.  Now the rebellious children set upon them.

Teachers were better targets than parents, who could only have been
attacked in an atomized and isolated manner.

They were also more important figures of authority than parents in
Chinese culture.  In practically every school in

China, teachers were abused and beaten, sometimes fatally.  Some
schoolchildren set up prisons in which teachers were tortured.

But this was not enough on its own to generate the kind of terror that
Mao wanted.  On i8 August, a mammoth rally was held in Tiananmen Square
in the center of

Peking, with over a million young participants.  Lin Biao appeared in
public as Mao's deputy and spokesman for the first time.  He made a
speech calling on the Red Guards to charge out of their schools and
'smash up the four olds' defined as 'old ideas, old culture, old
customs, and old habits."

Following this obscure call, Red Guards all over China took to the
streets, giving full vent to their vandalism, ignorance, and
fanaticism.  They raided people's houses, smashed their antiques, tore
up paintings and works of calligraphy.  Bonfires were lit to consume
books.  Very soon nearly all treasures in private collections were
destroyed.

Many writers and artists committed suicide after being cruelly beaten
and humiliated, and being forced to witness their work being burned to
ashes.  Museums were raided.

Palaces, temples, ancient tombs, statues, pagodas, city walls anything
'old' was pillaged.  The few things that survived, such as the
Forbidden City, did so only because Premier Zhou Enlai sent the army to
guard them, and issued specific orders that they should be protected.
The Red Guards only pressed on when they were encouraged.

Mao hailed the Red Guards' actions as "Very good indeed!"  and ordered
the nation to support them.

He encouraged the Red Guards to pick on a wider range of victims in
order to increase the terror.  Prominent writers, artists, scholars,
and most other top professionals, who had been privileged under the
Communist regime, were now categorically condemned as 'reactionary
bourgeois authorities."  With the help of some of these people's
colleagues who hated them for various reasons, ranging from fanaticism
to envy, the Red Guards began to abuse them.  Then there were the old
'class enemies': former landlords and capitalists, people with
Kuomintang connections, those condemned in previous political campaigns
like the 'rightists' and their children.

Quite a number of' class enemies' had not been executed or sent to
labor camps, but had been kept 'under surveillance."  Before the
Cultural Revolution, the police were allowed to release information
about them only to authorized personnel.  Now that policy changed.  The
police chief, one of Mao's own liege men Xie Fuzhi, ordered his men to
offer the 'class enemies' to the Red Guards, and to tell the Red Guards
about their crimes, such as their 'intention to overthrow the Communist
government."

Up till the beginning of the Cultural Revolution torture, as distinct
from torment, had been forbidden.  Now Xie ordered policemen 'not to be
bound by the old rules, no matter if they had been set by the police
authoriues or by the state."  After saying "I'm not in favor of beating
people to death," he continued: "But if some fRed Guards] hate the
class enemies so much that they want to kill them, you don't have to
force them to stop."

A wave of beating and torture swept the country, mainly during house
raids.  Almost invariably, the families would be ordered to kneel on
the floor and kowtow to the Red Guards; they were then beaten with the
brass buckles of the Guards' leather belts.  They were kicked around,
and one side of their head was shaved, a humiliating style called the
'yin and yang head," because it resembled the classic Chinese symbol of
a dark side (yin) and a light side (yang).

Most of their possessions were either smashed or taken away.

It was worst in Peking, where the Cultural Revolution

Authority was on hand to incite the young people.  In the city center
some theaters and cinemas were turned into torture chambers.  Victims
were dragged in from all over

Peking.  Pedestrians avoided the spots because the streets around
echoed with the screams of the victims.

The earliest Red Guard groups were made up of high officials' children.
Soon, when more people from other backgrounds joined, some of the high
officials' children managed to keep their own special groups, like the
"Pickets."  Mao and his camarilla took a number of steps calculated to
increase their sense of power.  At the second mass

Red Guards rally, Lin Biao wore their arm band to signify that he was
one of them.  Mme Mao made them the guards of honor in front of the
Gate of Heavenly Peace in Tiananmen Square on National Day, 1 October.
As a result, some of them developed an outrageous 'theory of the
bloodline," summed up in the words of a song: "The son of a hero father
is always a great man; a reactionary father produces nothing but a
bastard!"  Armed with this 'theory," some high officials' children
tyrannized and even tortured children from 'undesirable' backgrounds.

Mao let all this happen in order to generate the terror and chaos he
wanted.  He was not scrupulous about either who was hit or who were the
agents of violence.  These early victims were not his real targets, and
Mao did not particularly like or trust his young Red Guards.  He was
simply using them.  For their part, the vandals and torturers were not
always devoted to Mao.  They were just having a wild time, having been
licensed to indulge their worst instincts.

Only a small proportion of the Red Guards was actually involved in
cruelty or violence.  Many were able to avoid taking part because the
Red Guard was a loose organization which, by and large, did not
physically force its members to do evil.  As a matter of fact, Mao
himself never ordered the Red Guards to kill, and his instructions
regarding violence were contradictory.  One could feel devoted to Mao
without perpetrating violence or evil.

Those who chose to do so could not simply blame Mao.

But Mao's insidious encouragement of atrocities was undeniable.  On 18
August, at the first of the eight gigantic rallies which altogether
were attended by thirteen million people, he asked a female Red Guard
what her name was.

When she answered "Bin-bin," which means 'gentle," he said
disapprovingly, "Be violent' (yao-wu-ma).  Mao rarely spoke in public,
and this remark, well publicized, was naturally followed like the
gospel.  At the third mammoth rally, on x5 September, when the Red
Guards' atrocities were reaching their zenith, Mao's recognized
spokesman, Lin Biao, announced, with Mao standing next to him: "Red
Guard fighters: The direction of your battles has always been correct.
You have soundly, heartily battered the capitalist-roaders, the
reactionary bourgeois authorities, the bloodsuckers and parasites.  You
have done the right thing!

And you have done marvelously!"  At that, hysterical cheers,

deafening screams of "Long live Chairman Mao," uncontrollable tears,
and howled pledges of loyalty took possession of the crowds filling the
enormous Tiananmen Square.  Mao waved paternally, generating more
frenzy.

Through his Cultural Revolution Authority, Mao kept control over the
Peking Red Guards.  He then sent them to the provinces to tell the
local young people what to do.  In Jinzhou, in Manchuria, my
grandmother's brother Yu-lin and his wife were beaten up, and they and
their two children were exiled to a barren part of the country.  Yu-lin
had come under suspicion when the Communists first arrived, because of
his possession of a Kuomintang intelligence card, but nothing had
happened to him or his family until now.  My family did not know about
this at the time.

People avoided exchanging news.  With accusations so willfully
concocted, and the consequences so horrific, you never knew what
catastrophe you might bring to your correspondents, or they to you.

People in Sichuan had little idea of the extent of the terror in
Peking.  There were fewer atrocities in Sichuan, partly because the Red
Guards there were not directly incited by the Cultural Revolution
Authority.  In addition, the police in Sichuan turned a deaf ear to
their minister in Peking, Mr.  Xie, and refused to offer up the 'class
enemies' under their control to the Red Guards.  However, the Red
Guards in Sichuan, as in other provinces, copied the actions of those
in Peking.  There was the same kind of chaos as everywhere in China
controlled chaos.  The Red Guards may have looted the houses which they
were authorized to raid, but they rarely stole from shops.  Most
sectors, including commerce, the postal services and transport, worked
normally.

In my school, a Red Guard organization was formed on z6 August, with
the help of some Red Guards from Peking.

I had been staying at home feigning illness to escape the political
meetings and frightening slogans, and was unaware that the organization
had been set up until a

Mao's Red Guards 38I couple of days later, when a phone call summoned
me back 'to participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."
When I got to the school, I noticed that many pupils were proudly
wearing red armbands with gold characters saying "Red Guards."

In these early days, the newborn Red Guards had the immense prestige of
being Mao's babies.  It went without saying that I should join, and I
immediately submitted my application to the Red Guard leader in my form
a fifteen-year-old boy named Geng who had been constantly seeking my
company, but became shy and gauche the moment he was with me.

I could not help wondering how Geng had become a Red Guard, and he was
mysterious about his activities.  But it was very clear to me that the
Red Guards were mostly high officials' children.  The head of the
school Red Guards was one of the sons of Commissar Li, the Party first
secretary for Sichuan.  I ought to have been a natural;

few pupils had fathers in higher positions than mine.  But Geng
privately told me that I was considered soft and 'too inactive," and
must be toughened up before they could consider accepting me.

Since June, there had been an unwritten rule that everyone should
remain in school around-the-clock to devote themselves entirely to the
Cultural Revolution.  I was one of the few who did not.  But now the
thought of playing truant somehow gave me a sense of danger, and I felt
compelled to stay.  The boys slept in the classrooms so we girls could
occupy the dormitories.  Non-Red Guards were attached to Red Guard
groups and taken with them on their various activities.

The day after I returned to school, I was taken out with several dozen
other children to change street names to make them more
'revolutionary."  The street where I lived was called Commerce Street,.
and we debated what it should be renamed.  Some proposed "Beacon Road,"
to signify the role of our provincial Party leaders.  Others said

"Public Servants' Street," as that was what officials should be,
according to a quote of Mao's.  Eventually we left without settling on
anything because a preliminary problem could not be solved: the name
plate was too high up on the wall to reach.  As far as I knew, no one
ever went back.

In Peking the Red Guards were much more zealous.  We heard about their
successes: the British mission was now on "Anti-Imperialism Road," the
Russian embassy on "Anti-Revisionism Road."

In Chengdu, streets were shedding their old names like "Five
Generations under One Roof' (a Confucian virtue), "The Poplar and
Willow Are Green' (green was not a revolutionary color), and "Jade
Dragon' (a symbol of feudal power).  They became "Destroy the Old,"

"The East Is Red," and "Revolution' streets.  A famous restaurant
called "The Fragrance of Sweet Wind' had its plaque broken to bits.

It was renamed "The Whiff of Gunpowder."

Traffic was in confusion for several days.  For red to mean 'stop' was
considered impossibly counterrevolutionary.  It should of course mean
'go."  And traffic should not keep to the right, as was the practice,
it should be on the left.  For a few days we ordered the traffic
policemen aside and controlled the traffic ourselves.  I was stationed
at a street corner telling cyclists to ride on the left.  In Chengdu
there were not many cars or traffic lights, but at the few big
crossroads there was chaos.  In the end, the old rules reasserted
themselves, owing to Zhou Enlai, who managed to convince the Peking Red
Guard leaders.  But the youngsters found justifications for this: I was
told by a Red Guard in my school that in Britain traffic kept to the
left, so ours had to keep to the right to show our anti-imperialist
spirit.  She did not mention America.

As a child I had always shied away from collective activity.  Now, at
fourteen, I felt even more averse to it.  I suppressed this dread
because of the constant sense of guilt I had come to feel, through my
education, when I was out of step with Mao.  I kept telling myself that
I must train my thoughts according to the new revolutionary theories
and practices.  If there was anything I did not understand, I must
reform myself and adapt.  However, I found myself trying very hard to
avoid militant acts such as stopping passersby and cutting their long
hair, or narrow trouser legs, or skirts, or breaking their
semi-high-heeled shoes.

These things had now become signs of bourgeois decadence, according to
the Peking Red Guards.

My own hair came to the critical attention of my schoolmates.  I had to
have it cut to the level of my earlobes.

Secretly, though much ashamed of myself for being so 'petty bourgeois,"
I shed tears over losing my long plaits.

As a young child, my nurse had a way of doing my hair which made it
stand up on top of my head like a willow branch.  She called it
'fireworks shooting up to the sky."

Until the early 1960s I wore my hair in two coils, with rings of little
silk flowers wound around them.  In the mornings, while I hurried
through my breakfast, my grandmother or our maid would be doing my hair
with loving hands.  Of all the colors for the silk flowers, my favorite
was pink.

After 1964, following Mao's calls for an austere lifestyle, more suited
to the atmosphere of class struggle, I put patches on my trousers to
try to look 'proletarian' and wore my hair in the uniform style of two
plaits with no colors, but long hair had not been condemned as yet.  My
grandmother cut it for me, muttering all the while.  Her hair survived,
because she never went out at that time.

The famous teahouses in Chengdu also came under attack as 'decadent." I
did not understand why, but did not ask.  In the summer of 1966 I
learned to suppress my sense of reason.  Most Chinese had been doing
that for a long time.

A Sichuan teahouse is a unique place.  It usually sits in the embrace
of a bamboo grove or under the canopy of a large tree.  Around the low,
square wooden tables are bamboo armchairs which give out a faint aroma
even after years of use.  To prepare the tea a pinch of tea leaves is
dropped into a cup and boiling water is poured on top.

Then a lid is sunk loosely onto the cup, allowing the steam to seep
through the gap, bringing out the fragrance of the jasmine or other
blossoms.  Sichuan has many kinds of tea.

Jasmine alone has five grades.

Teahouses are as important to the Sichuanese as pubs are to the
British.  Older men, in particular, spend a lot of time there, puffing
their long-stemmed pipes over a cup of tea and a plateful of nuts and
melon seeds.  The waiter shuttles between the seats with a kettle of
hot water which he pours from a couple of feet away with pinpoint
accuracy.

A skillful waiter makes the water level higher than the edge of the cup
without it spilling over.  As a child I was always mesmerized watching
the water fall from the spout.  I was rarely taken to a teahouse,
though.  It had an air of indulgence of which my parents disapproved.

Like European cafes, a Sichuan teahouse provides newspapers on bamboo
frames.  Some customers go there to read, but it is primarily a place
to meet and chat, exchanging news and gossip.  There is often
entertainment storytelling punctuated with wooden clappers.

Perhaps because they had an aura of leisure, and if people were sitting
in one they were not out making revolution, teahouses had to be closed.
I went with a couple of dozen pupils between thirteen and sixteen years
old, most of whom were Red Guards, to a small one on the bank of the
Silk River.  Chairs and tables were spread outside under a Chinese
scholar tree.  The summer evening breeze from the river fanned out a
heavy scent from the clusters of white blossoms.  The customers, mostly
men, raised their heads from their chessboards as we approached along
the uneven cobblestones that paved the bank.  We stopped under the
tree.  A few voices from our group started to shout: "Pack up!  Pack
up!  Don't linger in this bourgeois place!"  A boy from my form
snatched a corner of the paper chessboard on the nearest table and
jerked it away.  The wooden pieces scattered on the ground.

The men who had been playing were quite young.  One of them lunged
forward, his fists clenched, but his friend quickly pulled the corner
of his jacket.  Silently they began to pick up the chess pieces.  The
boy who had jerked away their board shouted: "No more chess playing! 
Don't you know it is a bourgeois habit?"  He stooped to sweep up a
handful of pieces and threw them toward the river.

I had been brought up to be courteous and respectful to anyone older
than me, but now to be revolutionary meant being aggressive and
militant.  Gentleness was considered 'bourgeois."  I was repeatedly
criticized for it, and it was one reason given for not allowing me into
the Red Guards.

Over the years of the Cultural Revolution, I was to witness people
being attacked for saying 'thank you' too often, which was branded as
'bourgeois hypocrisy'; courtesy was on the brink of extinction.

But now, outside the teahouse, I could see that most of us, including
the Red Guards, were uneasy about the new style of speaking and lording
it over others.  Not many of us opened our mouths.  Quietly, a few
started to paste rectangular slogans onto the walls of the teahouse and
the tnmk of the scholar tree.

The customers silently began to walk away along the bank.  Watching
their disappearing figures, a feeling of loss overwhelmed me.  A couple
of months before, these adults probably would have told us to get lost.
But now they knew that Mao's backing had given the Red Guards power.

Thinking back, I can see the thrill some children must have felt at
demonstrating their power over adults.  A popular Red Guard slogan
went: "We can soar to heaven, and pierce the earth, because our Great
Leader Chairman Mao is our supreme commander!"  As this declaration
reveals, the Red Guards were not enjoying genuine freedom of
self-expression.  From the start they were nothing but the tool of a
tyrant.

Standing on the riverbank in August 1966, though, I was just confused.
I went into the teahouse with my fellow pupils.  Some asked the manager
to close down.  Others started pasting slogans on the walls.  Many
customers were getting up to go, but in a far corner one old man was
still sitting at his table, calmly sipping his tea.  I stood beside
him, feeling embarrassed that I was supposed to assume the voice of
authority.  He looked at me, and resumed his noisy sipping.  He had a
deeply lined face that was almost stereotypical 'working class' as
shown in propaganda pictures.  His hands reminded me of one of my
textbook stories which described the hands of an old peasant: they
could bundle thorny firewood without feeling any pain.

Perhaps this old man was very sure of his unquestionable background, or
his advanced age, which had hitherto been the object of respect, or
perhaps he simply did not think I was very impressive.  Anyway, he
remained in his seat taking no notice of me.  I summoned up my courage
and pleaded in a low voice, "Please, could you leave?"  Without looking
at me, he said, "Where to?"

"Home, of course," I replied.  He turned to face me.  There was emotion
in his voice, though he spoke quietly.

"Home?  What home?  I share a tiny room with my two grandsons.  I have
a corner surrounded by a bamboo curtain.  Just for the bed.  That's
all.  When the kids are home I come here for some peace and quiet.  Why
do you have to take this away from me?"

His words filled me with shock and shame.  This was the first time I
had heard a firsthand account of such miserable living conditions.  I
turned and walked away.

This teahouse, like all the others in Sichuan, was shut for fifteen
years until 198x, when Deng Xiaoping's reforms decreed it could be
reopened.  In 1985 I went back there with a British friend.  We sat
under the scholar tree.

An old waitress came to fill our cups with a kettle from two feet away.
Around us, people were playing chess.  It was one of the happiest
moments of that trip back.

When Lin Biao called for everything that represented the old culture to
be destroyed, some pupils in my school started to smash things up.
Being more than 2,000 years old, the school had a lot of antiques and
was therefore a prime site for action.  The school gateway had an old
tiled roof with carved eaves.  These were hammered to pieces.

The same happened to the sweeping blue-glazed roof of the big temple
which had been used as a ping-pong hall.

The pair of giant bronze incense burners in front of the temple were
toppled, and some boys urinated into them.

In the back garden, pupils with big hammers and iron rods went along
the sandstone bridges casually breaking the little statues.  On one
side of the sports field was a pair of towering rectangular tablets
made of red sandstone, each twenty feet high.  Some lines about
Confucius were carved on them in beautiful calligraphy.  A huge rope
was tied around them, and two gangs pulled.  It took them a couple of
days, as the foundations were deep.  They had to get some workers from
outside to dig a hole around the tablets.

When the monuments finally crashed down amidst cheers, they lifted part
of the path that ran behind them.

All the things I loved were disappearing.  The saddest thing of all for
me was the ransacking of the library: the golden filed roof, the
delicately sculpted windows, the blue painted chairs .... Bookshelves
were turned upside down, and some pupils tore books to pieces just for
the hell of it.

Afterward, X-shaped white paper strips with black characters were stuck
on what was left of the doors and windows to signal that the building
was sealed.

Books were major targets of Mao's order to destroy.

Because they had not been written within the last few months, and
therefore did not quote Mao on every page, some Red Guards declared
that they were all 'poisonous weeds."  With the exception of Marxist
classics and the works of Stalin, Mao, and the late Lu Xun, whose name
Mme Mao was using for her personal vendettas, books were burning all
across China.  The country lost most of its written heritage.  Many of
the books which survived later went into people's stoves as fuel.

But there was no bonfire at my school.  The head of the school Red
Guards had been a very conscientious student.

A rather feminine-looking seventeen-year-old, he had been made the Red
Guard leader because his father was the Party chief for the province,
rather than because of his own ambition.  While he could not prevent
the general vandalism, he did manage to stop the books from being
burned.

Like everyone else, I was supposed to join in the 'revolutionary
actions."  But I, like most pupils, was able to avoid them, because the
destruction was not organized, and no one made sure we took part.  I
could see that many pupils hated the whole thing, but nobody tried to
stop it.  Like myself, many boys and girls may well have been telling
themselves that they were wrong to feel sorry about the destruction and
needed to reform.  But subconsciously we all knew we would have been
crushed instantly had we raised any objection.

By then 'denunciation meetings' were becoming a major feature of the
Cultural Revolution.  They involved a hysterical crowd and were seldom
without physical brutality.

Peking University had taken the lead, under the personal supervision of
Mao.  At its first denunciation meeting, on i8 June, over sixty
professors and heads of depariments, including the chancellor, were
beaten, kicked, and forced to kneel for hours.  Dunce caps with
humiliating slogans were forced onto their heads.  Ink was poured over
their faces to make them black, the color of evil, and slogans were
pasted all over their bodies.  Two students gripped the arms of each
victim, twisting them around behind his back and pushing them up with
such ferocity as almost to dislocate them.  This posture was called the
'jet plane," and soon became a feature of most denunciation meetings
all over the country.

I was once called by the Red Guards in my form to attend such a
meeting.  Horror made me feel very chilly in the hot summer afternoon
when I saw a dozen or so teachers standing on the platform on the
sports ground, with their heads bent and their arms twisted into the
'jet plane' position.  Then, some were kicked on the back of their
knees and forced to kneel, while others, including my English-language
teacher, an elderly man with the fine manner of a classical gentleman,
were forced to stand on long, narrow benches.  He found it hard to keep
his balance, and swayed and fell, cutting his forehead on the sharp
corner of a bench.  A Red Guard standing next to him instinctively
stooped and extended his hands to help, but immediately straightened up
and assumed an exaggeratedly harsh posture, with his fists clenched,
yelling: "Get back onto the bench!"  He did not want to be seen as soft
on a 'class enemy."  Blood trickled down the teacher's forehead and
coagulated on the side of his face.

He, like the other teachers, was accused of all sorts of outlandish
crimes; but they were really there because they were graded, and
therefore the best, or because some pupils had grudges against them.

I learned in later years that the pupils in my school behaved
relatively mildly because, being in the most prestigious school, they
were successful and academically inclined.  In the schools which took
in wilder boys, there were teachers who were beaten to death.  I
witnessed only one beating in my school.  My philosophy teacher had
been somewhat dismissive to those who had not done well in her classes,
and some of them hated her and now started to accuse her of being
'decadent."  The 'evidence," which reflected the extreme conservatism
of the Cultural Revolution, was that she had met her husband on a bus.
They got to chatting, and fell in love.  Love arising out of a chance
meeting was regarded as a sign of immorality.  The boys took her to an
office and 'took revolutionary actions over her' the euphemism for
beating somebody up.  Before they started, they called for me
especially and made me

39 "Soar to Heaven, and Pierce the Earth' attend.

"What will she think when she sees you, her pet pupil, there!"

I was considered her favorite because she had praised my work often.
But I was also told that I should be there because I had been too soft,
and needed 'a lesson in revolution."

When the beating started, I shrank at the back of the ring of pupils
who crowded into the small office.  A couple of classmates nudged me to
go to the front and join in the hitting.  I ignored them.  In the
center my teacher was being kicked around, rolling in agony on the
floor, her hair askew.

As she cried out, begging them to stop, the boys who had set upon her
said in cold voices, "Now you beg!  Haven't you been ferocious?  Now
beg properly!"  They kicked her again, and ordered her to kowtow to
them and say "Please spare my life, masters!"  To make someone kowtow
and beg was an extreme humiliation.  She sat up and stared blankly
ahead: I met her eyes through her knotted hair.  In them I saw agony,
desperation, and emptiness.  She was gasping for breath, and her face
was ashen gray.  I sneaked out of the room.  Several pupils followed
me.  Behind us I could hear people shouting slogans, but their voices
were tentative and uncertain.  Many pupils must have been scared.  I
walked away swiftly, my heart pounding.  I was afraid I might be caught
and beaten myself.  But no one came after me, and I was not condemned
afterward.

I did not get into trouble in those days, in spite of my obvious lack
of enthusiasm.  Apart from the fact that the Red Guards were loosely
organized, I was, according to the 'theory of bloodlines," born bright
red, because my father was a high official.  Although I was disapproved
of, nobody did anything drastic, except criticize me.

At the time, the Red Guards divided pupils into three categories:
'reds," 'blacks," and 'grays."  The 'reds' were from the families of
'workers, peasants, revolutionary officials, revolutionary officers,
and revolutionary martyrs."

The 'blacks' were those with parents classified as 'land

lords, rich peasants, counterrevolution ari bad elements, and
rightists."  The 'grays' came from ambiguous families such as shop
assistants and clerks.  In my year, all pupils ought to have been
'reds' because of the screening in the enrollment.  But the pressure of
the Cultural Revolution meant that some villains had to be found.  As a
result, more than a dozen became 'grays' or 'blacks."

There was a girl named Ai-ling in my year.  We were old friends, and I
had often been to her house and knew her family well.  Her grandfather
had been a prominent economist, and her family had been enjoying a very
privileged life under the Communists.  Their house was large, elegant,
and luxurious, with an exquisite garden much better than my family's
apartment.  I was especially attracted by their collection of antiques,
in particular the snuff bottles which Ai-ling's grandfather had brought
back from England where he had studied at Oxford in the

19~0S.

Now, suddenly, Ai-ling became a 'black."  I heard that pupils from her
form had raided her house, smashed all the antiques, including the
snuff bottles, and beaten her parents and grandfather with the brass
buckles of their belts.  The next day when I saw her she was wearing a
scarf.  Her classmates had given her a 'yin and yang head."

She had had to have it completely shaved.  She wept with me.  I felt
terribly inadequate because I could not find any words to comfort
her.

In my own form a meeting was organized by the Red Guards at which we
all had to give our family backgrounds so we could be categorized.  I
announced 'revolutionary official' with great relief.  Three or four
pupils said 'office staff."  In the jargon of the day, this was
different from 'officials," who held more senior positions.  The
division was unclear, as there was no definition of what 'senior'
meant.  Nevertheless, these vague labels had to be used on various
forms, all of which had a space for 'family background."  Together with
a girl whose father was a shop assistant, the children of 'office
staff' were branded as 'grays."  It was announced that they were to be
kept under surveillance, sweep the school grounds and clean toilets,
bow their heads at all times, and be prepared to be lectured by any Red
Guard who cared to address them.  They also had to report their
thoughts and behavior every day.

These pupils suddenly looked subdued and shrunken.

Their vigor and enthusiasm, which they had had in abundance up to now,
had deserted them.  One gift bent her head and tears streamed down her
cheeks.  We had been friends.

After the meeting I went over to her to say something comforting, but
when she raised her head I saw resentment, almost hatred, in her eyes.
I walked away without a word, and wandered listlessly through the
grounds.  It was the end of August.  The Cape jasmine bushes spread
their rich fragrance.  It seemed strange there should be any scent at
all.

As dusk was descending I was walking back to the dormitory when I saw
something flash by a second-floor window of a classroom block about
forty yards away.  There was a muffled bang at the foot of the
building.  The hazy branches of some orange trees prevented me from
seeing what was happening, but people started to run in the direction
of the noise.  Out of the confused, suppressed exclamations I made out
the message: "Someone has jumped out of the window!"

I instinctively raised my hands to cover my eyes, and ran to my room. I
was terribly scared.  My mind's eye fixated on the blurry crooked
figure in midair.  Hurriedly I shut the windows, but the noise of
people talking nervously about what had happened filtered through the
thin glass.

A seventeen-year-old girl had attempted suicide.  Before the Cultural
Revolution, she had been one of the leaders of the Communist Youth
League, and had been a model in studying Chairman Mao's works and
learning from Lei Feng.  She had done many good deeds like washing her
comrades' clothes and cleaning out toilets, and frequently gave talks
to the school about how loyally she followed Mao's teachings.  She was
often to be seen strolling deep in conversation with a fellow pupil,
with a conscientious and purposeful look on her face, carrying out
'heart-to heart duties with someone who wanted to join the Youth
League.  But now, suddenly, she had been categorized as a 'black."  Her
father was 'office staff."  He worked for the municipal government, and
was a Party member.  But some of her classmates who found her a 'pain,"
and whose fathers were in higher posts, decided she should be a
'black."  In the last couple of days, she had been put under guard with
other 'blacks' and 'grays' and forced to pull grass out of the sports
ground.  To humiliate her, her classmates had shaved her beautiful
black hair, leaving her head grotesquely bald.  On that evening, the
'reds' in her form had been giving her and the other victims an
insulting lecture.

She retorted that she was more loyal to Chairman Mao than they were.
The 'reds' slapped her and told her she was not fit to talk about her
loyalty to Mao because she was a class enemy.  She ran to the window
and threw herself out.

Stunned and scared, the Red Guards rushed her to a hospital.  She did
not die, but she was crippled for life.

When I saw her many months later on the street, she was bent over on
crutches, her eyes blank.

On the night of her attempted suicide, I could not sleep.

The moment I closed my eyes, an indistinct figure loomed over me,
smeared with blood.  I was terrified and shaking.

The next day I asked for sick leave, which was granted.

Home seemed to be the only escape from the horror at school.  I
desperately wished I would never have to go out again.

17.  "Do You Want Our Children to Become Blacks" My Parents' Dilemma

(August-October 1966)

Home was no relief this time.  My parents seemed distracted, and hardly
noticed me.  When Father was not pacing up and down the apartment, he
was shut in his study.

Mother threw one waste basketful of crushed paper balls after another
into the kitchen stove.  My grandmother also looked as though she was
expecting disaster.  Her intense eyes were fixed on my parents, full of
anxiety.  Timorously, I watched their moods, too afraid to ask what was
wrong.

My parents did not tell me about a conversation they had had some
evenings before.  They had been sitting by an open window, outside
which a loudspeaker tied to a street lamp was blasting out endless
quotations of Mao's, particularly one about all revolutions being
violent by definition - 'the savage tumult of one class overthrowing
another."  The quotations were chanted again and again in a high
pitched shriek that roused fear and, for some, excitement.  Every now
and then there were announcements of 'victories' achieved by Red
Guards: they had raided more homes of 'class enemies' and 'smashed
their dogs' heads."

My father had been looking out at the blazing sunset.

He turned to my mother and said slowly: "I don't understand the
Cultural Revolution.  But I am certain that what is happening is
terribly wrong.  This revolution cannot be justified by any Marxist or
Communist principles.  People have lost their basic rights and
protection.  This is unspeakable.  I am a Communist, and I have a duty
to stop a worse disaster.  I must write to the Party leadership, to
Chairman Mao."

In China there was virtually no channel through which people could
voice a grievance, or influence policy, except appealing to the
leaders.  In this particular case, only Mao could change the situation.
Whatever Father thought, or guessed, about Mao's role, the only thing
he could do was to petition him.

My mother's experience told her that complaining was extremely
dangerous.  People who had done it, and their families, had suffered
vicious retribution.  She was silent for a long time, staring out over
the distant burning sky, trying to control her worry, anger, and
frustration.

"Why do you want to be a moth that throws itself into the fire?"

she said at last.

My father replied, "This is no ordinary fire.  It concerns the life and
death of so many people.  I must do something this time."

My mother said, with exasperation, "All right, you don't care about
yourself.  You have no concern for your wife.  I accept that.  But what
about our children?  You know what will happen to them once you get
into trouble.  Do you want our children to become "blacks"?"

My father said thoughtfully, as though he were trying to persuade
himself, "Every man loves his children.  You know that before a tiger
is about to jump and kill, he always looks back and makes sure that his
cub is all right.  Even a man-eating beast feels that way, let alone a
human being.

396 7)0 You Want Our Children to Become "Blacks '7' But a Communist has
to be more than that.  He has to think about other children.  What
about the children of the victims?"

My mother stood up and walked away.  It was no use.

Once she was on her own, she wept bitterly.

Father began to write his letter, tearing up draft after draft.  He had
always been a perfectionist, and a letter to Chairman Mao was no small
matter.  Not only did he have to formulate exactly what he wanted to
say, he had to try to minimize the potential consequences, particularly
to his family.  In other words, his criticism must not be seen as a
criticism.  He could not afford to offend Mao.

Father had begun thinking about his letter in June.

Waves of scapegoating had claimed several of his colleagues, and he
wanted to speak up for them.  But events had kept overtaking his plans.
Among other things, there had been more and more signs that he was
about to become a victim himself.  One day, my mother saw a prominent
wall poster in the center of Chengdu attacking him by name, calling him
'the number-one opponent of the Cultural Revolution in Sichuan."  This
was based on two accusations: the previous winter he had resistod
printing the article denouncing the Dramas of the Ming Mandarin, which
was Mao's original summons for the Cultural Revolution; and he had
drafted the "April Document," which opposed persecution and attempted
to limit the Cultural Revolution to nonpolitical debate.

When my mother told my father about the poster, he said at once that it
was the doing of the provincial Party leaders.  The two things it
accused him of were known only to a small circle at the top.  Father
felt convinced that they had now made up their minds to scapegoat him,
and he knew why.  Students from universities in Chengdu were beginning
to direct their offensive at the provincial leaders.

University students were entrusted with more information by the
Cultural Revolution Authority than middle-school pupils, and had been
told that Mao's real intention was to destroy the 'capitalist-roaders'
that is, Communist officials.  The students were generally not high
officials' children, as most Communist officials had married only after
the founding of the People's Republic in 1949 anti so did not have
children of university age.  Having no vested interest in the status
quo, the students were happy to turn on the officials.

The Sichuan authorities were outraged by the violence committed by
middle-school children, but the university students really made them
panic.  They felt they had to find a prominent scapegoat to placate the
students.  My father was one of the top officials in the field of
'culture," which was a major target of the Cultural Revolution.  He had
a reputation for insisting on his principles.  At a time when they
needed unanimity and obedience, they felt they could do without him.

Father's predicament was soon confirmed.  On 26 August he was asked to
attend a meeting for the students of Sichuan University, the most
prestigious university in the province.  They had been attacking the
chancellor and the senior staff, and were now raising their sights
toward the provincial Party officials.  The meeting was nominally for
the provincial leaders to hear the students' complaints.

Commissar Li sat on the platform, together with the whole panoply of
top Party officials.  The huge auditorium, the biggest in Chengdu, was
packed.

The students came to the meeting intending to make trouble, and the
hall was soon in pandemonium.  Students, shouting slogans and waving
flags, began jumping onto the stage to try to grab the microphone.
Although my father was not the chairman, it was he who was asked to
bring the situation under control.  While he was confronting the
students, the other Party officials left.

My father shouted: "Are you intelligent students, or are you hooligans?
Will you talk reason?"  In general, officials in China maintain an
impassive manner, in keeping with their status, but my father was
yelling like one of the stu 398 "Do You Want Our Children to Become
"Blacks"?"

dents.  Unfortunately, his genuineness did not impress them, and he
left amid much screaming of slogans.

Immediately afterward, huge wall posters appeared calling him 'the most
obstinate capitalist-roader, the diehard who opposes the Cultural
Revolution."

This meeting became a milestone.  It was from it that the Red Guard
group at Sichuan University took its name - 'z6 August."  This
organization was to become the core of a province wide bloc,
incorporating millions of people, and the major force in the Cultural
Revolution in Sichuan.

After the meeting, the provincial authorities ordered my father not to
leave our apartment under any circumstances for his own 'protection."
My father could see that he had first been deliberately exposed to the
students as a target, and then put under virtual house arrest.  He
added his own anticipated victimization to his letter to Mao.  One
night, with tears in his eyes, he asked my mother to take the letter to
Peking now that he had lost his freedom.

My mother had never wanted him to write the letter, but now she changed
her mind.  What tipped the balance was the fact that he was being
turned into a victim.  This meant that her children would become
'blacks' and she knew what that meant.  Going to Peking and appealing
to the top leaders was her only chance, however remote, of saving her
husband and her children.  She promised to take the letter.

On the last day of August I was awakened from an uneasy nap by a noise
from my parents' quarters.  I tiptoed to the half-opened door of my
father's study.  My father was standing in the middle of the room.
Several people were crowding around him.  I recognized them: they were
from his depa~uaent.  They all looked stern, devoid of their usual
eager-to-please smiles.  My father was saying, "Would you please thank
the provincial authorities for me?  I'm very grateful for their
concern.  But I prefer not to go into hiding.  A Communist should not
be afraid of students."

His voice was calm, but it contained a hint of emotion

which made me afraid.  Then I heard a rather important sounding man's
voice saying threateningly, "But Director Chang, surely the Party knows
best.  The university students are attacking you, and they can be
violent.  The Party thinks you should be placed under protection.  This
is the decision of the Party.  You must know that a Communist has to
obey Party decisions unconditionally."

After a silence, my father said quietly, "I obey the decision of the
Party.  I will go with you."

"But where to?"  I heard my mother asking.  Then an impatient man's
voice:

"The Party's instructions are: no one is to know."  When he came out of
the study my father saw me and took my hand.

"Father is going away for a while," he said.

"Be a good girl to your mother."

My mother and I walked with him to the side gate of the compound.  The
long path was lined with members of his department.  My heart was
pounding and my legs seemed to be made of cotton wool.  Father appeared
very agitated.  His hand was shaking in mine.  I stroked it with my
other hand.

A car was parked outside the gate.  The door was held open for him.
There were two men in the car, one in front and one in the back.
Mother's face was taut, but she was calm.  She looked into my father's
eyes and said, "Don't worry.  I will do it."  Without hugging me or my
mother, my father was gone.  The Chinese show little physical affection
in public, even at extraordinary times.

I did not realize that my father was being taken into custody, because
the act was dressed up as 'protection."

Being fourteen, I had not learned to decipher the regime's hypocritical
style; deviousness was involved here because the authorities had not
made up their minds what to do with my father.  As in most such cases,
the police played no role.  The people who came to take my father away
were members of his department with a verbal authorization from the
Provincial Party Committee.

As soon as Father was gone, my mother threw a few

clothes into a bag and told us she was going to Peking.  My father's
letter was still in draft form, with scribbles and alterations.  The
minute he saw the staff posse coming he had pushed it into her hand.

My grandmother hugged my four-year-old brother Xiao-fang and wept.  I
said I wanted to go with my mother to the station.  There was no lime
to wait for a bus, so we jumped into a tricycle taxi.

I was fearfid and confused.  My mother did not explain what was
happening.  She looked strained and preoccupied, deep in her thoughts.
When I asked her what was going on, she said briefly that I would know
in time, and left it at that.  I assumed she thought it was too
complicated to explain, and I was used to being told I was too young to
know certain things.  I could also tell that my mother was busy sizing
up the situation and planning her next moves, and I did not want to
distract her.  What I did not know was that she was battling to
comprehend the confused situation herself.

We sat in the tricycle taxi silent and tense, my hand in hers.  My
mother kept glancing over her shoulder: she knew the authorities would
not want her to get to Peking, and had only let me come with her so I
could be a witness in case anything happened.  At the station she
bought a 'hard-seat' ticket for the next train to Peking.  It was not
due until dawn, so we sat down on a bench in the waiting room, a kind
of shed with no walls.

I huddled up against her to wait for the long hours to pass.  Silently,
we gazed at the darkness descending over the cement ground of the
square in front of the station.  A few feeble bare bulbs on top of
wooden lampposts were shedding a pale light, reflected in the puddles
of water left over from a heavy thunderstorm that morning.  I felt
chilly in my summer blouse.  My mother wrapped her raincoat around me.
As the night dragged on, she told me to go to sleep.  Exhausted, I
dozed off with my head on her lap.

I was awakened by a movement of her knees.  I lifted my

My Parents' Dilemma 4o i head and saw two people in hooded raincoats
standing in front of us.  They were arguing about something in low
voices.  In my muddled state, I could not work out what they were
saying.  I could not even tell whether they were men or women.  I
vaguely heard my mother say, in a calm, restrained voice, "I will shout
for the Red Guards."  The gray-hooded raincoats fell silent.  They
whispered to each other and then walked away, obviously not wanting to
attract attention.

At dawn, my mother got on the train to Peking.

Years later she told me that the two people were women she knew, junior
officials from my father's depasiment.

They told her the authorities had ruled that her going to Peking was an
'anti-Party' act.  She quoted the Party charter, which said that it was
the right of any Party member to appeal to the leaders.  When the
emissaries indicated that they had men wailing in a car who could seize
her by force, my mother said that if they did she would shout for help
from the Red Guards around the station and tell them they were trying
to stop her going to Peking to see Chairman Mao.  I asked her how she
could be sure the Red Guards would help her rather than the pursuers.

"Suppose they denounced you to the Red Guards as a class enemy who was
trying to escape?"  Mother smiled and said, "I calculated that they
would not take the risk.  I was prepared to gamble everything.  I had
no alternative."

In Peking my mother took my father's letter to a 'grievance office."
Chinese rulers throughout history, having never permitted an
independent legal system, had set up offices where ordinary people
could lodge grievances against their bosses, and the Communists
inherited this tradition.  When during the Cultural Revolution it began
to look as though Communist bosses were losing their power, many people
who had been persecuted by them in the past flooded into Peking to
appeal.  But the Cultural Revolution Authority soon made it clear that
'class enemies' were not allowed to complain, even against
'capitalist-roaders."  If they tried to do so they would be doubly
punished.

Few cases concerning senior officials like my father were presented to
the grievance office, so my mother received special attention.  She was
also one of the very few spouses of victims who had the courage to go
and appeal in Peking, as they were under pressure to 'draw a line'
between themselves and those accused rather than invite trouble by
speaking up for the victims.  My mother was received almost immediately
by Vice-Premier Tao Zhu, who was the head of the Central Department of
Public Affairs and one of the leaders of the Cultural Revolution at the
time.

She gave him my father's letter, and pleaded with him to order the
Sichuan authorities to release my father.

A couple of weeks later, Tao Zhu saw her again.  He gave her a letter
which said my father had acted in a perfectly constitutional manner and
in concert with the Sichuan party leadership, and should be released at
once.  Tao had not investigated the case.  He took my mother's word,
because what had happened to my father was a common occurrence: Party
officials all over China were choosing scapegoats in their panic to
save their own skins.  Tao gave her the letter directly rather than
sending it through normal Party channels, knowing they were in
disarray.

Tao Zhu showed he understood and agreed with the other concerns in my
father's letter: the epidemic of scape boating and the widespread
random violence.  My moO' could see he wanted to control the situation.
As it happened, because of this, he himself was soon to be condemned as
'the third biggest capitalist-roader," after Lin Shaoqi and Deng
Xiaoping.

Meanwhile, my mother hand-copied Tao Zhu's letter, mailed the copy to
my grandmother and asked her to show it to my father's deparunent and
to tell them that she would return only after they released my father.
My mother was worried that if she returned to Sichuan the authorities
there might arrest her, seize the letter and not release my father. She
felt that, on balance, her best bet was to stay in Peking, where she
could continue to exercise pressure.

My grandmother passed on my mother's hand-copied text of Tao Zhu's
letter.  But the provincial authorities said the whole thing was a
misunderstanding, and that they were just protecting my father.  They
insisted that my mother must come back and stop her individualistic
meddling.

Officials came to our apartment several times to try to persuade my
grandmother to go to Peking and bring my mother back.  One said to her,
"I'm really thinking of your daughter.  Why persist in misunderstanding
the Party?  The Party was only trying to protect your son-in-law.  Your
daughter would not listen to the Party and went to Peking.

I'm worried for her that if she does not come back, she will be
regarded as anti-Party.  And you know how serious that is.  Being her
mother, you must do what is best for her.  The Party has promised that
as long as she comes back and makes a self-criticism, she will be
forgiven."

The thought that her daughter was in trouble brought my grandmother to
the verge of collapse.  After several such sessions, she was wavering.
Then one day her mind was made up for her: she was told that my father
was having a nervous breakdown, and only when my mother came home would
they send him to a hospital.

The Party gave my grandmother two tickets, one for herself and one for
Xiao-fang, and they set off to Peking, thirty-six hours away by train.
As soon as my mother heard the news, she sent a telegram to tell my
father's department she was on her way, and started making arrangements
to return home.  She arrived back with my grandmother and Xiao-fang in
the second week of October.

During her absence, the whole of September, I had stayed at home to
keep my grandmother company.  I could see that she was consumed by
worry, but I did not know what was going on.  Where was my father?  Was
he under arrest,

or was he being protected?  Was my family in trouble or not?  I did not
know no one said anything.

I could stay at home because the Red Guards never exercised the
rigorous control the Party did.  Besides, I had a sort of 'patron' in
the Red Guards, Geng, my gauche fifteen-year-old boss, who had made no
effort to summon me back to the school.  But at the end of September he
telephoned to urge me to get back before I October, National Day, or I
would never be able to join the Red Guards.

I was not forced to join the Red Guards.  I was keen to do so.  In
spite of what was happening around me, my aversion and fear had no
clear object, and it never occurred to me to question the Cultural
Revolution or the Red Guards explicitly.  They were Mao's creations,
and Mao was beyond contemplation.

Like many Chinese, I was incapable of rational thinking in those days.
We were so cowed and contorted by fear and indoctrination that to
deviate from the path laid down by Mao would have been inconceivable.
Besides, we had been overwhelmed by deceptive rhetoric, disinformation,
and hypocrisy, which made it virtually impossible to see through the
situation and to form an intelligent judgment.

Back at school, I heard that there had been many complaints from 'reds'
demanding to know why they had not been admitted to the Red Guards.
That was why it was important to be there on National Day, as there was
going to be a big enrollment, incorporating all the rest of the 'reds."
So, at the very time the Cultural Revolution had brought disaster on my
family, I became a Red Guard.

I was thrilled by my red arm band with its gold characters.  It was the
fashion of the day for Red Guards to wear old army uniforms with
leather belts, like the one Mao was seen wearing at the beginning of
the Cultural Revolution.

I was keen to follow the fashion, so as soon as I was enrolled I rushed
home, and from the bottom of an old trunk I dug out a pale-gray Lenin
jacket which had been my mother's uniform in the early 1950S.  It was a
little too big, so I got my grandmother to take it in.  With a leather
belt from a pair of my father's trousers my costume was complete.  But
out on the streets I felt very uncomfortable.

I found my image too aggressive.  Still, I kept the outfit on.

Soon after this my grandmother went to Peking.  I had to stay in the
school, having just joined the Red Guards.

Because of what had happened at home, the school frightened and
startled me all the time.  When I saw the 'blacks' and 'grays' having
to clean the toilets and the grounds, their heads bowed, a creeping
dread came over me, as though I were one of them.  When the Red Guards
went off at night on house raids, my legs went weak, as if they were
heading for my family.  When I noticed pupils whispering near me, my
heart started to palpitate frantically:

were they saying that I had become a 'black," or that my father had
been arrested?

But I found a refuge: the Red Guard reception office.

There were a lot of visitors to the school.  Since September 1966, more
and more young people were on the road, traveling all over the country.
To encourage them to travel around and stir things up, transport, food,
and accommodations were provided free.

The reception office was in what had once been a lecture hall.  The
wandering and often aimless visitors would be given cups of tea and
chatted to.  If they claimed to have serious business, the office would
make an appointment for them to see one of the school Red Guard
leaders.  I zeroed in on this office because the people in it did not
have to participate in actions like guarding the 'blacks' and 'grays,"
or go on house raids.  I also liked it because of the five girls
working there.  There was an air of warmth and lack of zealotry around
them which made me feel soothed the moment I met them.

A lot of people used to come to the office, and many would hang around
to chat with us.  There was often a line at the door, and some returned
again and again.  Looking back now, I can see that the young men really
wanted some female company.  They were not that engrossed in the
revolution.  But I remember being extremely earnest.  I never avoided
their gazes or returned their winks, and I conscientiously took notes
of all the nonsense they spouted.

One hot night two rather coarse middle-aged women turned up at the
reception office, which was boisterous as usual.  They introduced
themselves as the director and deputy director of a residents'
committee near the school.

They talked in a very mysterious and grave manner, as though they were
on some grand mission.  I had always disliked this kind of affectation,
so I turned my back.  But soon I could tell that an explosive piece of
information had been delivered.  The people who had been hanging around
started shouting, "Get a truck!  Get a truck!  Let's all go there!"
Before I knew what was happening, I was swept out of the room by the
crowd and into a truck.  As Mao had ordered the workers to support the
Red Guards, trucks and drivers were permanently at our service.  In the
truck, I was squeezed next to one of the women.  She was retelling her
story, her eyes full of eagerness to ingratiate herself with us.  She
said that a woman in her neighborhood was the wife of a Kuomintang
officer who had fled to Taiwan, and that she had hidden a portrait of
Chiang Kai-shek in her apa~iment.

I did not like the woman, especially her toadying smile.

And I resented her for making me go on my first house raid.  Soon the
truck stopped in front of a narrow alley.  We all got out and followed
the two women down the cobbled path.  It was pitch-dark, the only light
coming from the crevices between the planks of wood that formed the
walls of the houses.  I staggered and slipped, trying to fall behind.

The apa~i,nent of the accused woman consisted of two rooms, and was so
small that it could not hold our truckful of people.  I was only too
happy to stay outside.  But before long someone shouted that space had
been made for those outside to come in and 'receive an education in
class struggle."

As soon as I was pressed into the room with the others, my nostrils
were filled with the stench of feces, urine, and unwashed bodies.  The
room had been turned upside down.  Then I saw the accused woman.  She
was perhaps in her forties, kneeling in the middle of the room, partly
naked.  The room was lit by a bare fifteen-watt bulb.  In its shadows,
the kneeling figure on the floor looked grotesque.

Her hair was in a mess, and part of it seemed to be matted with blood.
Her eyes were bulging out in desperation as she shrieked: "Red Guard
masters!  I do not have a portrait of Chiang Kai-shek!  I swear I do
not!"  She was banging her head on the floor so hard there were loud
thuds and blood oozed from her forehead.  The flesh on her back was
covered with cuts and bloodstains.  When she lifted her bottom in a
kowtow, murky patches were visible and the smell of excrement filled
the air.  I was so frightened that I quickly averted my eyes.  Then I
saw her tormentor, a seventeen-year-old boy named Chian, whom up to now
I had rather liked.  He was lounging in a chair with a leather belt in
his hand, playing with its brass buckle.

"Tell the truth, or I'll hit you again," he said languidly.

Chian's father was an army officer in Tibet.  Most officers sent to
Tibet left their families in Chengdu, the nearest big city in China
proper, because Tibet was considered an uninhabitable and barbaric
place.  Previously I had been rather attracted by Chian's languorous
manner, which had given an impression of gentleness.  Now I murmured,
trying to control the quaking in my voice, "Didn't Chairman Mao teach
us to use verbal struggle [wendou] rather than violent struggle
[wu-dou]?  Maybe we shouldn't... ?"

My feeble protest was echoed by several voices in the room.  But Chian
cast us a disgusted sideways glance and said emphatically: "Draw a line
between yourselves and the class enemy.  Chairman Mao says, "Mercy to
the enemy is cruelty to the people!"  If you are afraid of blood, don't
be Red Guards!"  His face was twisted into ugliness by fanaticism.  The
rest of us fell silent.  Although it was impossible to feel anything
but revulsion at what he was doing, we could not argue with him.  We
had been taught to be ruthless to class enemies.  Failure to do so
would make us class enemies ourselves.  I turned and walked quickly
into the garden at the back.  It was crammed with Red Guards with
shovels.  From inside the house the sound of lashes started again,
accompanied by screams that made my hair stand on end.  The yelling
must have been unbearable for the others too, because many swiftly
straightened up from their digging: "There is nothing here.  Let's
go!

Let's go?  As we passed through the room, I caught sight of Chian
standing casually over his victim.  Outside the door, I saw the woman
informer with the ingratiating eyes.

Now there was a cringing and frightened look there.  She opened her
mouth as if to say something, but no words came out.  As I glanced at
her face, it dawned on me that there was no portrait of Chiang
Kai-shek.  She had denounced the poor woman out of vindictiveness.  The
Red Guards were being used to set He old scores.  I climbed back into
the truck full of disgust and rage.

18.  "More Than Gigantic

Wonderful News'm

Pilgrimage to Peking

(October-December 1966)

I found an excuse to get out of school, and was home again the next
morning.  The apariment was empty.  My father was in detention.  My
mother, grandmother, and Xiao-fang were in Peking.  My teenage siblings
were living their own, separate lives elsewhere.

Jin-ming had resented the Cultural Revolution from the very beginning.
He was in the same school as me, and was in his first year.  He wanted
to become a scientist, but this was denounced by the Cultural
Revolution as 'bourgeois."

He and some boys in his form had formed a gang before the Cultural
Revolution.  They loved adventure and mystery, and had called
themselves the "Iron-Wrought Brotherhood."  Jin-ming was their
number-one brother.  He was tall, and brilliant at his studies.  He had
been giving his form weekly magic shows using his chemistry knowledge,
and had been openly skipping lessons which he was not interested in or
which he had already gone beyond.

And he was fair and generous to the other boys.

When the school Red Guard organization was set up on

August, Jin-ming's 'brotherhood' was merged into it.

He and his gang were given the job of printing leaflets and
distributing them on the streets.  The leaflets had been written by
older Red Guards in their mid-teens and typically had rifles like
"Founding Declaration of the First Brigade of the First Army Division
of the Red Guards of the Number Four School' (all Red Guard
organizations had grand names), "Solemn Statement' (a pupil announced
he was changing his name to "Huang the Guard for Chairman Mao'), "More
Than Gigantic Wonderful News' (a member of the Cultural Revolution
Authority had just given an audience to some Red Guards), and "The
Latest Most Supreme Instructions' (a word or two by Mao had just been
leaked out).

Jin-ming was soon bored stiff by this gibberish.  He started to absent
himself from his missions, and became interested in a girl of his age,
thirteen.  She seemed to him the perfect lady beautiful, gentle, and
slightly aloof, with a touch of shyness.  He did not approach her, but
was content to admire her from afar.

One day the pupils in his form were summoned to go on a house raid. The
older Red Guards said something about 'bourgeois intellectuals." All
members of the family were declared prisoners and ordered to gather in
one room while the Red Guards searched the rest of the house.

Jin-ming was appointed to watch the family.  To his delight, the girl
was the other 'jailer."

There were three 'prisoners': a middle-aged man and his son and
daughter-in-law.  They had obviously been expecting the raid, and sat
with resigned expressions on their faces, staring into Jin-ming's eyes
as though into space.  Jin-ming felt very awkward under their gaze, and
he was also uneasy because of the presence of the girl, who looked
bored and kept glancing toward the door.  When she saw several boys
carrying a huge wooden case full of porcelain, she mumbled to Jin-ming
that she was going to have a look, and left the room.

3i

Facing his captives alone, Jin-ming felt his discomfort growing.  Then
the woman prisoner stood up and said she wanted to go and breast-feed
her baby in the next room.

Jin-ming readily agreed.

The moment she left the room, the object of Jin-ming's affection rushed
in.  Sternly, she asked him why a prisoner was at large.  When Jin-ming
said he had given permission, she yelled at him for being 'soft on
class enemies."  She was wearing a leather belt on what Jin-ming had
thought of as her 'willowy' waist.  Now she pulled it off and pointed
it at his nose a stylized Red Guard posture while she screamed at him.
Jin-ming was struck dumb.  The girl was unrecognizable.  All of a
sudden she was far from gentle, shy, or lovely.  She was all hysterical
ugliness.  Thus was Jin-ming's first love extinguished.

But he shouted back.  The girl left the room and returned with an older
Red Guard, the leader of the group.  He started yelling so much his
spittle splashed on Jinming, and he too pointed his rolled-up belt at
him.  Then he stopped, realizing that they should not be washing their
dirty linen in front of class enemies.  He ordered Jin-ming to go back
to the school to 'wait for adjudication."

That evening, the Red Guards in Jin-ming's form held a meeting without
him.  When the boys came back to the dormitory, their eyes avoided his.
They behaved distantly for a couple of days.  Then they toldJin-ming
they had been arguing with the militant girl.  She had reported
Jin-ming's 'surrender to the class enemies' and had insisted that he be
given a severe punishment.  But the Iron-Wrought Brotherhood defended
him.  Some of them resented the girl, who had been terribly aggressive
toward other boys and girls too.

Still, Jin-ming was punished: he was ordered to pull out grass
alongside the 'blacks' and 'grays."  Mao's instruction to exterminate
grass had led to a constant demand for manpower because of the grass's
obstinate nature.  This

412 Wl ore Than Gigantic Wonderful News' fortuitous by offered a form
of punishment for the newby created 'class enemies."

Jin-ming pulled up grass only for a few days.  His Iron Wrought
Brotherhood could not bear to see him suffer.

But he had been classified as a 'sympathizer with class enemies," and
was never sent on any more raids, which suited him fine.  He soon
embarked on a journey with his brotherhood sight-seeing all over the
country, taking in China's rivers and mountains, but, unlike most Red
Guards, Jin-ming never made the pilgrimage to Peking to see Mao.  He
did not come home until the end of ,966.

My sister Xiao-hong, at fifteen, was a founding member of the Red
Guards at her school.  But she was only one among hundreds, as the
school was crammed with officials' children, many of them competing to
be active.  She hated and feared the atmosphere of militancy and
violence so much that she was soon on the verge of a nervous
collapse.

She came home to ask my parents for help at the beginning of September,
only to find they were not there: my father was in detention and my
mother had gone to Peking.  My grandmother's anxiety made her even more
scared, so she returned to her school.  She volunteered to help 'guard'
the school library, which had been ransacked and sealed, like the one
at my school.  She spent her days and nights reading, devouring all the
forbidden fruits she could.  It was this that held her together.  In
mid-September, she set out on a long tour around the country with her
friends and like Jin-ming she did not come home until the end of the
year.

My brother Xiao-her was almost twelve, and was at the same key primary
school I had attended.  When the Red Guards were formed in the middle
schools, Xiao-her and his friends were eager to join.  To them the Red
Guards meant freedom to live away from home, staying up all night, and
power over adults.  They went to my school and begged to be allowed
into the Red Guards.  To get rid of

Pilgrimage to Peking 4x 3 them, one Red Guard said offnandedly, "You
can form the First Army Division of Unit 4969."  So Xiao-her became the
head of the Propaganda Department of a troop of twenty boys, all the
others being 'commander," 'chief of staff," and so on.  There were no
privates.

Xiao-her joined in hitting teachers twice.  One of the victims was a
sports teacher, who had been condemned as a 'bad element."  Some girls
of Xiao-her's age had accused the teacher of touching their breasts and
thighs during gym lessons.  So the boys set upon him, not least to
impress the girls.  The other teacher was the moral tutor.  As corporal
punishment was banned in schools, she would complain to the parents,
who would beat their sons.

One day, the boys set out on a house raid, and were assigned to go to a
household which was rumored to be that of an ex-Kuomintang family. They
did not know what exactly they were supposed to do there.  Their heads
had been filled with vague notions of finding something like a diary
saying how the family longed for Chiang Kai-shek's comeback and hated
the Communist Party.

The family had five sons, all well-built and tough looking  They stood
by the door, arms akimbo, and looked down at the boys with their most
intimidating stares.  Only one boy attempted to tiptoe in.  One of the
sons picked him up by the scruff of his neck and threw him out with one
hand.  This put an end to any further such 'revolutionary actions' by
Xiao-her's 'division."

So, in the second week of October, while Xiao-her was living at his
school and enjoying his freedom, Jin-ming and my sister were away
traveling, and my mother and grandmother were in Peking, I was alone at
home when one day, without warning, my father appeared on the
doorstep.

It was an eerily quiet homecoming.  My father was a changed person.  He
was abstracted and sunk deep in thought, and did not say where he had
been or what had

4z4 ~14ore Than Gigantic Wonderful News' been happening to him.  I
listened to him pacing his room through sleepless nights, too
frightened and worried to sleep myself.  Two days later, to my
tremendous relief, my mother returned from Peking with my grandmother
and Xiao-fang.

My mother immediately went to my father's deparunent and handed Tao
Zhu's letter to a deputy director.  Straight away, my father was sent
to a health clinic.  My mother was allowed to go with him."

I went there to see them.  It was a lovely place in the country,
bordered on two sides by a beautiful green brook.

My father had a suite with a sitting room in which there was a row of
empty bookshelves, a bedroom with a large double bed, and a bathroom
with shiny white files.  Outside his balcony, several osmanthus trees
spread an intoxicating scent.  When the breeze blew, tiny golden
blossoms floated softly down to the grass less earth.

Both my parents seemed peaceful.  My mother told me they went fishing
in the brook every day.  I felt they were safe, so I told them I was
planning to leave for Peking to see Chairman Mao.  I had longed to make
this trip, like almost everybody else.  But I had not gone because I
felt I should be around to give my parents support.

Making the pilgrimage to Peking was very much encouraged and food,
accommodations, and transport were all free.  But it was not organized.
I left Chengdu two days later with the five other girls from the
reception office.  As the train whistled north, my feelings were a
mixture of excitement and nagging disquiet about my father.  Outside
the window, on the Chengdu Plain, some rice fields had been harvested,
and squares of black soil shone among the gold, forming a rich
patchwork.  The countryside had been only marginally affected by the
upheavals, in spite of repeated instigations by the Cultural Revolution
Authority led by Mme Mao.  Mao wanted the population fed so that they
could 'make revolution," so he did not give his wife his full backing.
The peasants knew that if they got involved and stopped producing food,
they would be the first to starve, as they had learned in the famine
only a few years before.  The cottages among the green bamboo groves
seemed as peaceful and idyllic as ever.  The wind gently swayed the
lingering smoke to form a crown over the graceful bamboo tips and the
concealed chimneys.  It was less than five months since the beginning
of the Cultural Revolution, but my world had changed completely.  I
gazed out at the quiet beauty of the plain, and let a wistful mood
envelop me.  Fortunately, I did not have to worry about being
criticized for being 'nostalgic," which was considered bourgeois, as
none of the other girls had an accusing turn of mind.  With them, I
felt I could relax.

The prosperous Chengdu Plain soon gave way to low hills.  The snowy
mountains of west Sichuan glistened in the distance.  Before very long
we were traveling in and out of the tunnels through the towering Qjn
Mountains, the wild range that cuts Sichuan off from the north of
China.

With Tibet to the west, the hazardous Yangtze Gorges to the east, and
the southern neighbors considered barbarians, Sichuan had always been
rather self-contained, and the Sichuanese were known for their
independent spirit.  Mao had been concerned about their legendary
inclination to seek some margin of independence, and had always made
sure the province was in the firm grip of Peking.

After the Qjn Mountains, the scenery became dramatically different. The
soft greenness gave way to harsh yellow earth, and the thatched
cottages of the Chengdu Plain were replaced by rows of dry mud
cave-huts.  It was in caves like these that my father had spent five
years as a young man.

We were only a hundred miles from Yan'an, where Mao had set up his
headquarters after the Long March.  It was there that my father dreamed
his youthful dreams and became a devoted Communist.  Thinking of him,
my eyes became moist.

The journey took two days and a night.  The attendants

4x6 ~lore Than Gigantic Wonderful News' came to talk to us often and
told us how envious they were that we would be seeing Chairman Mao
soon.

At Peking Station huge slogans welcomed us as "Chairman Mao's guests."
It was after midnight, yet the square in front of the station was lit
~up like daytime.  Searchlights swept through the thousands and
thousands of young people, all wearing red armbands and speaking often
mutually unintelligible dialects.  They were talking, shouting,
giggling, and quarreling against the background of a gigantic chunk of
stolid Soviet-style architecture the station itself.  The only Chinese
features were the pastiche pavilion like roofs on the two clock towers
at each end.

As I stumbled drowsily out into the searchlights, I was enormously
impressed by the building, its ostentatious grandeur and its shiny
marbled modernity.  I had been used to traditional dark timber columns
and rough brick walls.

I looked back, and with a surge of emotion saw a huge portrait of Mao
hanging in the center, under three golden characters, "Peking Station,"
in his calligraphy.

Loudspeakers directed us to the reception rooms in a corner of the
station.  In Peking, as in every other city in China, administrators
were appointed to arrange food and accommodations for the traveling
youngsters.  Dormitories in universities, schools, hotels, and even
offices were pressed into service.  After waiting on line for hours, we
were assigned to Q~mghua University, one of the most prestigious in the
country.  We were taken there by coach and told that food would be
provided in the canteen.  The running of the gigantic machine for the
millions of traveling youngsters was overseen by Zhou Enlai, who dealt
with the daily chores with which Mao could not be bothered.

Without Zhou or somebody like him, the country and with it the Cultural
Revolution would have collapsed, and Mao let it be known that Zhou was
not to be attacked.

We were a very serious group, and all we wanted to do was to see
Chairman Mao.  Unfortunately, we had just missed his fifth review of
Red Guards in Tiananmen

Square.  What were we to do?  Leisure activities and sightseeing were
out irrelevant to the revolution.  So we spent all our time on the
campus copying wall posters.  Mao had said that one purpose of
traveling was to 'exchange information about the Cultural Revolution."
That was what we would do: bring the slogans of the Peking Red Guards
back to Chengdu.

Actually, there was another reason for not going out:

transport was impossibly crowded and the university was out in the
suburbs, about ten miles from the city center.

Still, we had to tell ourselves that our disinclination to move was
correctly motivated.

Staying on the campus was intensely uncomfortable.

Even today I can still smell the latrines down the corridor from our
room, which were so blocked that the water from the washbasins and
urine and loosened excrement from the toilets flooded the tiled floor.
Fortunately, the doorway to the latrines had a ridge, which prevented
the stinking overflow from invading the corridor.  The university
administration was paralyzed, so there was nobody to get repairs done.
But children from the countryside were still using the toilets: manure
was not considered untouchable by peasants.  When they trudged out,
their shoes left highly odorous stains along the corridor and in the
rooms.

A week passed, and still there was no news of another rally at which we
could see Mao.  Subconsciously desperate to get away from our
discomfort, we decided to go to Shanghai to visit the site where the
Communist Party had been founded in 19:zl, and then on to Mao's
birthplace in Hunan, in south-central China.

These pilgrimages turned out to be hell: the trains were unbelievably
packed.  The dominance of the Red Guards by high officials' children
was coming to an end, because their parents were beginning to come
under attack as capitalist-roaders.  The oppressed 'blacks' and 'grays'
began to organize their own Red Guard groups and to travel.  The color
codes were beginning to lose their meaning.  I rem em 4x 8 Wlore Than
Gigantic Wonderful News' her meeting on one train a very beautiful,
slim girl of about eighteen, with unusually big, velvet black eyes and
long, thick eyelashes.  As was the custom, we started by asking each
other what 'family background' we were from.  I was amazed at the
unembarrassed manner with which this lovely girl replied that she was a
'black."  And she seemed confidently to be expecting us 'red' girls to
be friendly with her.

The six of us were very un militant in our behavior, and our seats were
always the center of boisterous chatting.

The oldest member of our group was eighteen, and she was particularly
popular.  Everyone called her "Plumpie," as she was very well padded
all around.  She laughed a lot, with a deep, chesty, operafc sound. She
sang a lot too, but, of course, only songs of Chairman Mao's
quotations.

All songs except these and a few in praise of Mao were banned, like all
other forms of entertainment, and remained so for the ten years of the
Cultural Revolution.

This was the happiest I had been since the start of the

Cultural Revolution, in spite of the persistent worry about my father
and the agony involved in traveling.  Every inch of space in the trains
was occupied, even the luggage racks.

The toilet was jam-packed: no one could get in.  Only our determination
to see the holy sites of China sustained us.

Once, I desperately needed to relieve myself.  I was sitting squeezed
up next to a window, because five people were crammed onto a narrow
seat made for three.  With an incredible struggle I reached the toilet
but when I got there I decided it was impossible to use it.  Even if
the boy who sat on the lid of the tank with his feet on the toilet seat
cover could lift his legs for one moment, even if the girl who sat
between his feet could somehow manage to be held up briefly by the
others filling every usable space around her, I could not bring myself
to do it in front of all these boys and girls.  I returned to my seat
on the verge of tears.  Panic worsened the bursting sensation, and my
legs were shaking.  I resolved to use the toilet at the next stop.

After what seemed an interminable time, the train stopped at a small,
dusk-enveloped station.  The window was opened and I clambered out, but
when I came back I found

I could not get in.

I was perhaps the least athletic of us six.  Previously, whenever I had
had to climb into a train through the window, one of my friends had
always lifted me from the platform while others pulled me from inside.
This time, although I was being helped by about four people from
inside, I could not hoist my body high enough to get my head and elbows
in.  I was sweating like mad, even though it was freezing cold.  At
this point, the train started to pull away.  Panicking, I looked around
to see if there was anyone who could help.  My eyes fell on the thin,
dark face of a boy who had sidled up beside me.  But his intention was
not to lend me a hand.

I had my purse in a pocket of my jacket, and because of my climbing
position it was quite visible.  With two fingers, the boy picked it
out.  He had presumably chosen the moment of departure to snatch it.  I
burst out crying.  The boy paused.  He looked at me, hesitated, and put
the purse back.  Then he took hold of my right leg and hoisted me up. I
landed on the table as the train was beginning to pick up speed.

Because of this incident, I developed a soft spot for adolescent
pickpockets.  In the coming years of the Cultural Revolution, when the
economy was in a shambles, theft was widespread, and I once lost a
whole year's food coupons.  But whenever I heard that policemen or
other custodians of' law and order' had beaten a pickpocket, I always
felt a pang.  Perhaps the boy on that winter platform had shown more
humanity than the hypocritical pillars of society.

Altogether we traveled about 2,000 miles on this trip, in a state of
exhaustion such as I had never experienced in my life.  We visited
Mao's old house, which had been turned into a museum-cum-shrine.  It
was rather grand quite different from my idea of a lodging for
exploited peasants, as I had expected it to be.  A cap ton underneath
an enormous photograph of Mao's mother said that she had been a very
kind person and, because her family was relatively well off, had often
given food to the poor.  So our Great Leader's parents had been rich
peasants!  But rich peasants were class enemies!  Why were Chairman
Mao's parents heroes when other class enemies were objects of hate? The
question frightened me so much that I immediately suppressed it..

When we got back to Peking in mid-November, the capital was freezing.
The reception offices were no longer at the station, because the area
was too small for the huge number of youngsters now pouring in.  A
truck took us to a park where we spent the whole night waiting for
accommodations to be allocated.  We could not sit down because the
ground was covered with frost and it was unbearably cold.  I dozed off
for a second or two standing up.  I was not used to the harsh Peking
winter and, having left home in the autumn, had not brought any winter
clothes with me.  The wind cut through my bones, and the night seemed
never-ending.  So did the line.  It meandered around and around the
ice-covered lake in the middle of the park.

Dawn came and went and we were still in line, absolutely exhausted.  It
was not until dusk fell that we reached our accommodations: the Central
Drama School.  Our room had once been used for singing classes.  Now
there were two rows of straw mattresses on the floor, no sheets or
pillows.  We were met by some air force officers, who said they had
been sent by Chairman Mao to look after us and give us military
training.  We all felt very moved by the concern Chairman Mao showed
us.

Military training for the Red Guards was a new development.  Mao had
decided to put a brake on the random destruction which he had
unleashed.  The hundreds of Red Guards lodged in the Drama School were
organized into a 'regiment' by the air force officers.  We struck up a
good relationship with them, and liked two
officers in particular, whose family backgrounds we learned at once, as
was customary.  The company commander had been a peasant from the
north, while the political commissar came from an intellectual's family
in the famous garden city of Suzhou.  One day they proposed taking the
six of us to the zoo, but asked us not to tell the others because their
jeep could not hold any more people.  Besides, they implied, they were
not supposed to divert us to activities irrelevant to the Cultural
Revolution.  Not wanting to get them into trouble we declined, saying
we wanted to 'stick to making revolution."  The two officers brought us
bagfuls of big ripe apples, which were seldom seen in Chengdu, and
bunches of toffee-coated water chestnuts, which we had all heard of as
a great Peking specialty.  To repay their kindness, we sneaked into
their bedroom and collected their dirty clothes, then washed them with
great enthusiasm.  I remember struggling with the big khaki uniforms,
which were extremely heavy and hard in the icy water.  Mao had told the
people to learn from the armed forces, because he wanted everyone to be
as regimented and indoctrinated with loyalty to him alone as the army
was.  Learning from servicemen had gone hand in hand with the promotion
of affection for them, and numerous books, articles, songs, and dances
featured girls helping soldiers by washing their clothes.

I even washed their underpants, but nothing sexual ever entered my
mind.  I suppose many Chinese girls of my generation were too dominated
by the crushing political upheavals to develop adolescent sexual
feelings.  But not all.  The disappearance of parental control meant it
was a time of promiscuity for some.  When I got back home I heard about
a former classmate of mine, a pretty girl of fifteen, who went off
traveling with some Red Guards from Peking.  She had an affair on the
way and came back pregnant.  She was beaten by her father, followed by
the accusing eyes of the neighbors, and enthusiastically gossiped about
by her comrades.  She hanged
herself, leaving a note saying she was 'too ashamed to live."  No one
challenged this medieval concept of shame, which might have been a
target of a genuine cultural revolution.  But it was never one of Mao's
concerns, and was not among the 'olds' which the Red Guards were
encouraged to destroy.

The Cultural Revolution also produced a large number of militant
puritans, mostly young women.  Another girl from my form once received
a love letter from a boy of sixteen.  She wrote back calling him 'a
traitor to the revolution': "How dare you think about such shameless
things when the class enemies are still rampant, and people in the
capitalist world still live in an abyss of misery!"  Such a style was
affected by many of the girls I knew.  Because Mao called for girls to
be militant, femininity was condemned in the years when my generation
was growing up.  Many girls tried to talk, walk, and act like
aggressive, crude men, and ridiculed those who did not.  There was not
much possibility of expressing femininity anyway.  To start with, we
were not allowed to wear anything but the shapeless blue, grey or green
trousers and jackets.

Our air force officers drilled us round and round the Drama School's
basketball courts every day.  Next to the courts was the canteen.  My
eyes used to steal toward it as soon as we formed up, even if I had
just finished breakfast.

I was obsessed with food, although I was not sure whether this was due
to the lack of meat, or the cold, or the boredom of the drilling.  I
dreamed of the variety of Sichuan cuisine, of crispy duckling,
sweet-and-sour fish, "Drunken Chicken," and dozens of other succulent
delicacies.

None of us six girls was used to having money.  We also thought that
buying things was somehow 'capitalist."  So, in spite of my obsession
with food, I only bought one bunch of toffee-coated water chestnuts,
after my appetite for them had been whetted by the ones our officers
gave us.  I resolved to give myself this treat after a great deal of
agonizing and consultation with the other girls.  When I got home after
the trip I immediately devoured some stale biscuits, while handing my
grandmother the almost untouched money she had given me.  She pulled me
into her arms and kept saying, "What a silly girl!"

I also returned home with rheumatism.  Peking was so cold that water
froze in the taps.  Yet I was drilling, in the open, without an
overcoat.  There was no hot water to warm up our icy feet.  When we
first arrived, we were given a blanket each.  Some days later, more
girls arrived, but there were no more blankets.  We decided to give
them three and share the other three between us six.  Our upbringing
had taught us to help comrades in need.  We had been informed that our
blankets had come from stores reserved for wartime.  Chairman Mao had
ordered them to be taken out for the comfort of his Red Guards.  We
expressed our heartfelt gratitude to Mao.  Now, when we ended up with
hardly any blankets, we were told to be even more grateful to Mao,
because he had given us all China had.

The blankets were small, and could not cover two people unless they
slept close together.  The shapeless nightmares which had started after
I had seen the attempted suicide had become worse after my father was
taken away and my mother left for Peking; and since I slept badly, I
often twisted out from under the blanket.  The room was poorly heated,
and once I fell asleep, an icy chill invaded me.  By the time we left
Peking the joints in my knees were so inflamed that I could hardly bend
them.

My discomfort did not stop there.  Some children from the countryside
had fleas and lice.  One day I came into our room and saw one of my
friends crying.  She had just discovered a blot of tiny white eggs in
the armpit seam of her underwear lice eggs.  This threw me into a
panic, because lice caused unbearable itchiness and were associated
with dirtiness.  From then on, I felt itchy all the time, and examined
my underwear several times a day.  How I longed for Chairman Mao to see
us soon so I could go home!

On the afternoon of 24 November, I was in one of our usual Mao
quotation studying sessions in one of the boys' rooms (officers and
boys would not come into the girls' rooms, out of modesty).  Our nice
company commander came in with an unusually light gait and proposed
conducting us in the most famous song of the Cultural Revolution: "When
Sailing the Seas, We Need the Helmsman."

He had never done this before, and we were all pleasantly surprised. He
waved his arms beating time, his eyes shining, his cheeks flushed. When
he finished, and announced with restrained excitement that he had some
good news, we knew immediately what it was.

"We're going to see Chairman Mao tomorrow!"  he exclaimed.  The rest of
his words were drowned out by our cheers.  After the initial wordless
yelling, our excitement took the form of shouting slogans: "Long live
Chairman Mao!"

"We will follow Chairman Mao forever!"

The company commander told us that no one could leave the campus from
that minute on, and that we should watch one another to make sure of
this.  To be asked to watch one another was quite normal.  Besides,
these were safety measures for Chairman Mao, which we were only too
glad to apply.  After dinner, the officer approached my five companions
and me, and said in a hushed and solemn voice: "Would you like to do
something to ensure Chairman Mao's safety?"

"Of course!"  He signaled for us to keep quiet, and continued in a
whisper: "Would you propose before we leave tomorrow morning that we
all search each other to make sure that no one is carrying anything
they shouldn't?  You know, young people might forget about the rules
.... He had announced the rules earlier that we must not bring anything
metal, not even keys, to the rally.

Most of us could not sleep, and excitedly talked the night away.  At
four o'clock in the morning we got up and gathered in disciplined ranks
for the hour-and-a-half walk to Tiananmen Square.  Before our 'company'
set off, at a wink from the officer, Plumpie stood up and proposed a
search.  I could see that some of the others thought she was wasting
our time, but our company commander cheerfully seconded her proposal.
He suggested we search him first.

A boy was called to do this, and found a big bunch of keys on him.  Our
commander acted as though he had been genuinely careless, and gave
Plumpie a victorious smile.

The rest of us searched each other.  This roundabout way of doing
things reflected a Maoist practice: things had to look as though they
were the wish of the people, rather than commands from above. Hypocrisy
and playacting were taken for granted.

The early-morning streets were bursting with activity.

Red Guards were marching toward Tiananmen Square from all over the
capital.  Deafening slogans surged like roaring waves.  As we chanted,
we raised our hands and our Little Red Books formed a dramatic red line
against the darkness.  We reached the square at dawn.  I was placed in
the seventh row from the front on the wide northern pavement of the
Avenue of Eternal Peace to the east side of Tiananmen Square.  Behind
me were many more rows.

After lining us up tidily, our officers ordered us to sit down on the
hard ground cross-legged.  With my inflamed joints, this was agony, and
I soon got pins and needles in my bottom.  I was deadly cold and drowsy
and exhausted because I could not fall asleep.  The officers conducted
nonstop singing, making different groups challenge each other, to keep
up our spirits.

Shortly before noon, hysterical waves of "Long live Chairman Mao!"
roared from the east.  I had been flagging and was slow to realize that
Mao was about to pass by in an open car.  Suddenly thunderous yelling
exploded all around me.

"Long live Chairman Mao!  Long live Chairman Mao!"  People sitting in
front of me shot up and hopped in delirious excitement, their raised
hands frantically waving their Litfie Red Books.

"Sit down!  Sit down!"

I cried, in vain.  Our company commander had said that we all had to
remain seated throughout.  But few seemed to be observing the rules,
possessed by their urge to set eyes on Mao.

Having been sitting for so long, my legs had gone numb.

For some seconds, all I could see was a boiling sea of the backs of
heads.  When I finally managed to totter to my feet, I caught only the
very end of the motorcade.  Liu Shaoqi, the president, had his face
turned in my direction.

Wall posters had already started attacking Liu as "China's Khrushchev'
and the leading opponent of Mao.

Although he had not been officially denounced, it was clear that his
downfall was imminent.  In press reports of the Red Guard rallies, he
was always given a very undistinguished place.  In this procession,
instead of standing next to Mao, as the number-two man should have
done, he was right at the back, in one of the last cars.

Liu looked subdued and weary.  But I did not have any feelings for him.
Although he was the president, he did not mean anything to my
generation.  We had grown up imbued with the cult of Mao alone.  And if
Liu was against Mao, it seemed to us natural that he should go.

At that moment, with the sea of youngsters screaming their loyalty to
Mao, Liu must have felt how utterly hopeless his situation was.  The
irony was that he himself had been instrumental in promoting Mao's
deification, which had led to this explosion of fanaticism in the youth
of a nation which was largely unreligious.  Liu and his colleagues may
have helped deificao in order to appease him, thinking that he would be
satisfied with abstract glory and leave them to get on with the mundane
work, but Mao wanted absolute power both on earth and in heaven.  And
perhaps there was nothing they could have done: the cult of Mao may
have been unstoppable.

These reflections did not occur to me on the morning of 25 November
1966.  All I cared about then was catching a glimpse of Chairman Mao. I
turned my eyes quickly away from Liu to the front of the motorcade. I
spotted Mao's stalwart back, his right arm steadily waving.  In an
instant, he had disappeared.  My heart sank.  Was that all I would see
of Chairman Mao?  Only a fleeting glimpse of his back?

The sun seemed suddenly to have turned gray.  All around me the Red
Guards were making a huge din.  The girl standing next to me had just
pierced the index finger of her right hand and was squeezing blood out
of it to write something on a neatly folded handkerchief.  I knew
exactly the words she was going to use.  It had been done many times by
other Red Guards and had been publicized ad name am "I am the happiest
person in the world today.  I have seen our Great Leader Chairman Mao!"
Watching her, my despair grew.  Life seemed pointless.  A thought
flickered into my mind: perhaps I should commit suicide?

It vanished almost the next instant.  Looking back, I suppose the idea
was really a subconscious attempt to quantify my devastation at having
my dream smashed, especially after all the hardships I had suffered on
my journey.  The bursting trains, the inflamed knees, the hunger and
cold, the itchiness, the blocked toilets, the exhaustion all in the end
unrewarded.

Our pilgrimage was over and a few days later we headed home.  I had had
enough of the trip, and I longed for warmth and comfort, and a hot
bath.  But the thought of home was tinged with apprehension.  No matter
how uncomfortable, the journey had never been frightening, as my life
immediately prior to it had been.  Living in close contact with
thousands and thousands of Red Guards for well over a month, I had
never seen any violence, or felt terror.  The gigantic crowds,
hysterical though they were, were well disciplined and peaceful.  The
people I met were friendly.

Just before I left Peking, a letter came from my mother.

It said my father had fully recovered and everyone in Chengdu was fine.
But she added at the end that both she

4z8 Wlore Than Gigantic Wonder~l News' and my father were being
criticized as capitalist-roaders.

My heart sank.  By now it had become clear to me that
capitalist-roaders Communist officials were the main targets of the
Cultural Revolution.  I was soon to see what this meant for my family
and for me.

19.  "Where There Is a Will to Condemn, There Is Evidence'-My Parents
Tormented

(December 1966-1967)

A capitalist-roader was supposed to be a powerful official who was
pursuing capitalist policies.  But in reality no officials had any
choice about which policies they pursued.

The orders of Mao and those of his opponents were all presented as
coming from the Party, and the officials had to obey all of them even
though in doing so they were obliged to carry out many zigzags and even
U-turns.  If they really disliked a particular order, the most they
could do was engage in passive resistance, which they had to try hard
to disguise.  It was therefore impossible to determine whether
officials were capitalist-roaders or not on the basis of their work.

Many officials had their own views, but the Party rule was that they
must not reveal them to the public.  Nor did they dare to.  So whatever
the officials' sympathies were, they were unknown to the general
public.

But ordinary people were the very force Mao now ordered to attack
capitalist-roaders without, of course, the benefit of either
information or the right to exercise

43 "Where There Is a Will to Condemn, There Is Evidence' any
independent judgment.  So what happened was that officials came under
attack as capitalist-roaders because of the positions they held.
Seniority alone was not the cflteflon.  The decisive factor was whether
a person was the leader of a relatively self-contained unit or not. The
whole population was organized into units, and the people who
represented power to ordinary people were their immediate bosses unit
leaders.  In designating these people for attack, Mao was tapping into
the most obvious pool of resentment, in the same way that he had
incited pupils against teachers.  Unit leaders were also the key links
in the chain of the Communist power structure which Mao wanted to get
rid of.

It was because they were leaders of deparl,uents that both my parents
were denounced as capitalist-roaders.

"Where there is a will to condemn, there is evidence," as the Chinese
saying has it.  On this basis, all unit leaders across China, big and
small, were summarily denounced by people under them as
capitalist-roaders for implementing policies that were alleged to be
'capitalist' and anti Chairman Mao."  These included allowing free
markets in the countryside, advocating better professional skills for
workers, permitting relative literary and artistic freedom, and
encouraging competitiveness in sports now termed 'bourgeois
cups-and-medals mania."  Until now most officials had had no idea that
Mao had disliked these policies after all, the directives had all come
from the Party, which was led by him.  Now they were told, out of the
blue, that all these policies had come from the 'bourgeois
headquarters' within the Party.

In every unit there were people who became activists.

They were called Rebel Red Guards, or "Rebels' for short.

They wrote wall posters and slogans proclaiming "Down with the
capitalist-roaders," and held denunciation meetings against their
bosses.  The denunciations often sounded hollow, because the accused
simply said that they had been carrying out Party orders Mao had always
told them to

My Parents Tormented 43 i obey Party orders unconditionally, and had
never told them of the existence of the 'bourgeois headquarters."  How
were they to know?  And how could they have acted otherwise?

The officials had many supporters, some of whom rallied to their
defense.  They were called the "Loyalists."  Verbal and physical
battles broke out between them and the Rebels.  Because Mao never said
explicitly that all Party bosses should be condemned, some militants
became hesitant: what if the bosses they attacked turned out not to be
capitalist-roaders?  Beyond the posters and slogans and denunciation
meetings, ordinary people did not know what they were expected to do.

So when I returned to Chengdu in December 1966 I sensed a distinct
uncertainty in the air.

My parents were living at home.  The health clinic where my father had
been staying had asked them to leave in November because
capitalist-roaders were supposed to go back to their units to be
denounced.  The small canteen in the compound had been closed down, and
we all had to get our food from the big canteen, which went on working
normally.  My parents continued to receive their salaries every month,
in spite of the fact that the Party system was paralyzed and they did
not go to work.  Since their departments dealt with culture, and their
bosses in Peking were particularly hated by the Maos and had been
purged at the start of the Cultural Revolution, my parents were in the
direct line of fire.  They were attacked in wall posters with standard
abuse like "Bombard Chang Shou-yu' and "Burn Xia De-hong."  The
accusations against them were the same as those made against almost
every director of every Department of Public Affairs up and down the
country.

Meetings were convened in my father's department to denounce him.  He
was yelled at.  As with most political struggles in China, the real
impetus came from personal animosity.  Father's foremost accuser was a
Mrs.  Shau, a prim and fiercely self-righteous deputy section chief
who

432 "Where There Is a Will to Condemn, There Is Evidence' had long been
aspiring to get rid of the prefix 'deputy."

She considered that her promotion had been blocked by my father, and
was determined to take revenge.  Once she spat in his face and slapped
him.  But in general the anger was limited.  Many of the staff liked
and respected my father and were not fierce to him.  Outside his
department, some organizations for which he had been responsible, like
the Sichuan Daily, also held denunciation meetings against him.  But
the staff there bore no personal grudges against him, and the meetings
were formalities.

Against my mother there were no denunciation meetings at all.  As a
grass-roots official, she had looked after more individual units than
my father schools, hospitals, and entertainment groups.  Normally,
someone in her position would have been denounced by people from these
organizations.  But she was left alone by all of them.  She had been
responsible for solving their personal problems, such as housing
transfers, and pensions.  And she had done her job with unfailing
helpfulness and efficiency.  She had tried her best in previous
campaigns not to victimize anyone, and had in fact managed to protect
many.  People knew the risks she had run, and repaid her by refusing to
turn on her.

On my first evening back home my grandmother made 'cloud-swallowing'
dumplings and steamed rice in palm leaves filled with 'eight
treasures."  My mother gave me a cheerful account of what had been
happening to her and my father.  She said they had agreed they did not
want to be officials anymore after the Cultural Revolution.  They were
going to apply to be ordinary citizens, and enjoy a normal family life.
As I was to realize later, this was no more than a self-deluding
fantasy, because the Communist

Party allowed no opting out; but at the time they needed something to
hold on to.

My father also said: "Even a capitalist president can become an
ordinary citizen overnight.  It's a good thing not to be given
permanent power.  Otherwise officials will tend to abuse their power."
He then apologized to me for ha~Sng been dictatorial with the family.

"You are like singing cicadas silenced by chilling winter," he said,
'and it is good that you young people should rebel against us, the
older generation."  Then he said, half to me, half to himself, 'l think
there is nothing wrong with officials like me being subject to
criticism even a bit of hardship and loss of face."

This was another confused attempt by my parents to try to cope with the
Cultural Revolution.  They did not resent the prospect of losing their
privileged positions in fact, they were trying to see this as something
positive.

Nineteen sixty-seven came.  Suddenly, the Cultural Revolution switched
into high gear.  In its first stage, with the Red Guard movement, an
atmosphere of terror had been created.  Now Mao turned to his major
goal: to replace the 'bourgeois headquarters' and the existing Party
hierarchy with his personal power system.  Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping
were formally denounced and detained, as was Tao Zhu.

On 9 January, the People'sDaily and the radio announced that a "January
Storm' had started from Shanghai, where Rebels had taken control.  Mao
called on people throughout China to emulate them and seize power from
the capitalist-roaders.

"Seize power' (duo-quart)!  This was a magic phrase in China.  Power
did not mean influence over policies it meant license over people.  In
addition to money, it brought privilege, awe, and fawning, and the
opportunity to take revenge.  In China, there were virtually no safety
valves for ordinary people.  The whole country was like a pressure
cooker in which a gigantic head of compressed steam had built up. There
were no football matches, pressure groups, law suits, or even violent
films.  It was impossible to voice any kind of protest about the system
and its injustices, unthinkable to stage a demonstration. Even talking
about politics an important form of relieving pressure in most
societies was taboo.  Subordinates had very little chance of redress
against their bosses.  But if you were a boss of some kind, you had a
chance to vent your frustration.  So when Mao launched his call to
'seize power," he found a huge constituency of people who wanted to
take revenge on somebody.  Although power was dangerous, it was more
desirable than powerlessness, particularly to people who had never had
it.  Now it looked to the general public as if Mao was saying that
power was up for grabs.

In practically every unit in China, the morale of the Rebels was
immensely boosted.  So were their numbers.

All sorts of people -workers, teachers, shop assistants, even the staff
of government offices started calling themselves "Rebels."  Following
the example of Shanghai, they physically beat the now disorientated
"Loyalists' into surrender.  The earlier Red Guard groups, like the one
in my school, were disintegrating, because they had been organized
around the children of high officials, who were under attack.  Some
early Red Guards who opposed the new phase of the Cultural Revolution
were arrested.  One of the sons of Commissar Li was beaten to death by
Rebels who accused him of having let slip a remark against Mme Mao.

The people in my father's depafiment who had been in the posse which
had taken him away to be detained were now Rebels.  Mrs.  Shau was
chief of a Rebel group for all the Sichuan government offices, in
addition to being its branch leader in my father's depa~uuent.

No sooner were the Rebels formed than they split into factions and
fought for power in almost every work unit in China.  All sides accused
their opponents of being 'anti Cultural Revolution," or of being loyal
to the old Party system.  In Chengdu, the numerous groups quickly
coalesced into two opposing blocs, headed by two universiF Rebel
groups: the more militant 'z6 August' from Sichuan University, and the
relatively moderate "Red Chengdu' from Chengdu University.  Each
commanded a following of millions of people throughout the province. In
my father's department, Mrs.  Shau's group was affiliated with 26
August, and the opposing group mainly consisting of more moderate
people whom my father had liked and promoted, and who liked him with
the Red Chengdu.

Outside our apartment, beyond the compound walls, 26 August and Red
Chengdu each rigged up loudspeakers to trees and electricity poles,
which blasted out abuse of each other day and night.  One night, I
heard that 26 August had gathered hundreds of supporters and attacked a
factory which was a stronghold of Red Chengdu.  They captured the
workers and tortured them, using methods including 'singing fountains'
(splitting their skulls open so the blood burst out) and 'landscape
paintings' (slashing their faces into patterns).  Red Chengdu's
broadcasts said several workers had become martyrs by jumping from the
top of the building.  I gathered they had killed themselves because
they were unable to stand the torture.

One major target of the Rebels was the professional elite in every
unit, not only prominent doctors, artists, writers, and scientists, but
also engineers and graded workers, even model night-soil collectors
(people who collect human waste, which was extremely valuable to the
peasants).  They were accused of having been promoted by
capitalistroaders, but were really the object of their colleagues'
jealousy.  Other personal scores were also settled in the name of the
revolution.

The "January Storm' triggered brutal violence against the
capitalist-roaders.  Power was now being seized from Party officials,
and people were spurred on to abuse them.

Those who had hated their Party bosses grabbed the opportunity to take
revenge, although the victims of previous persecutions were not allowed
to act.  It was some time before Mao got around to making new
appointments, as he did not know whom to appoint at this stage, so
ambitious careerists were eager to show their militancy in the hope
that this would get them chosen as the new holders of power.  Rival
factions competed to outdo each other in brutality.  Much of the
population colluded, driven by intimidation, conformism, devotion to
Mao, desire to set He personal scores, or just the releasing of
frustration.

Physical abuse finally caught up with my mother.  It did not come from
people working under her, but mainly from ex-convicts who were working
in street workshops in her Eastern District robbers, rapists, drug
smugglers, and pimps.  Ulalike 'political criminals," who were on the
receiving end of the Cultural Revolution, these common criminals were
encouraged to attack designated victims.  They had nothing against my
mother personally, but she had been one of the top leaders in her
district, and that was enough.

At meetings held to denounce her, these ex-convicts were particularly
active.  One day she came home with her face twisted in pain.  She had
been ordered to kneel on broken glass.  My grandmother spent the
evening picking fragments of glass from her knees with tweezers and a
needle.  The next day she made my mother a pair of thick kneepads.  She
also made her a padded waist protector, because the tender structure of
the waist was where the assailants always aimed their punches.

Several times my mother was paraded through the streets with a dunce
cap on her head, and a heavy placard hanging from her neck on which her
name was written with a big cross over it to show her humiliation and
her demise.  Every few steps, she and her colleagues were forced to go
down on their knees and kowtow to the crowds.  Children would be
jeering at her.  Some would shout that their kowtowing did not make
enough noise and demand that they do it again.  My mother and her
colleagues then had to bang their foreheads loudly on the stone
pavement.

One day that winter there was a denunciation meeting at a street
workshop.  Before the meeting, while the participants had lunch in the
canteen, my mother and her colleagues were ordered to kneel for one and
a half hours on grit-covered ground in the open.  It was raining and
she got soaked to the skin; the biting wind sent icy chills through her
wet clothes and into her bones.  When the meeting started, she had to
stand bent double on the platform, trying to control her shivers.  As
the wild, empty screaming went on, her waist and neck became unbearably
painful.  She twisted herself slightly, and tried to lift her head a
bit to ease the aching.  Suddenly she felt a heavy blow across the back
of her head, which knocked her to the ground.

It was only some time later that she learned what had happened.  A
woman sitting in the front row, a brothel owner who had been imprisoned
when the Communists clamped down on prostitution, had fixated on my
mother, perhaps because she was the only woman on the platform.

The moment my mother lifted her head, this woman jumped up and thrust
an awl straight at her left eye.  The Rebel guard standing behind my
mother saw it coming and struck her to the ground.  Had it not been for
him, my mother would have lost her eye.

My mother did not tell us about this incident at the time.

She seldom referred to what happened to her at all.  When she had to
mention something like the broken glass she said it casually, trying to
make it sound as undramatic as possible.  She never showed the bruises
on her body, and she was always composed, even cheerful.  She did not
want us to worry about her.  But my grandmother could tell how much she
was suffering.  She would follow my mother anxiously with her eyes,
trying to hide her own pain.

One day our former maid came to see us.  She and her husband were among
the few who never broke off with our family through the whole of the
Cultural Revolution.  I felt immensely grateful for the warmth they
brought us, especially as they ran the risk of being accused as
'sympathizers of capitalist-roaders."  Awkwardly, she mentioned to my
grand mother that she had just seen my mother being paraded through the
streets.  My grandmother pressed her to say more, then suddenly
collapsed, the back of her head hitting the floor with a loud bang. She
had lost consciousness.

Gradually, she came to.  With tears rolling down her cheeks, she said,
"What has my daughter done to deserve this?"

My mother developed a hemorrhage from her womb, and for the next six
years, until she had a hysterectomy in 1973, she bled most days.
Sometimes it was so severe she would faint and had to be taken to a
hospital.  Doctors prescribed hormones to control the flow of blood,
and my sister and I gave her the injections.  My mother knew it was
dangerous to depend on hormones, but there was no alternative.  It was
the only way she could get through the denunciation meetings.

In the meantime, the Rebels in my father's department stepped up their
assaults on him.  Being one of the most important in the provincial
government, the depa~isuent had more than its share of opportunists.
Formerly obedient instruments of the old Party system, many now became
fiercely militant Rebels, led by Mrs.  Shall under the banner of 26
August.

One day, a group of them barged into our apariment and marched into my
father's study.  They looked at the bookshelves, and declared him a
real 'diehard' because he still had his 'reactionary books."  Earlier,
in the wake of the book burning by the teenage Red Guards, many people
had set fire to their collections.  But not my father.  Now he made a
faint attempt to protect his books by pointing at the sets of Marxist
hardbacks.

"Don't try to fool us Red Guards!"  yelled Mrs.  Shau.

"You have plenty of "poisonous weeds"!"  She picked up some Chinese
classics printed on flimsy rice paper.

"What do you mean, "us Red Guards"?"  my father retorted.

"You are old enough to be their mother and you ought to have more
sense, too."

Mrs.  Shau slapped my father hard.  The crowd barked at him
indignantly, although a few tried to hide their giggles Then they
pulled out his books and threw them into huge jute sacks they had
brought with them.  When all the bags were full, they carried them
downstairs, telling my father they were going to burn them on the
grounds of the department the next day after a denunciation meeting
against him.  They ordered him to watch the bonfire 'to be taught a
lesson."  In the meantime, they said, he must burn the rest of his
collection.

When I came home that afternoon, I found my father in the kitchen.  He
had lit a fire in the big cement sink, and was hurling his books into
the flames.

This was the first time in my life I had seen him weeping.

It was agonized, broken, and wild, the weeping of a man who was not
used to shedding tears.  Every now and then, in fits of violent sobs,
he stamped his feet on the floor and banged his head against the
wall.

I was so frightened that for some time I did not dare to do anything to
comfort him.  Eventually I put my arms around him and held him from the
back, but I did not know what to say.  He did not utter a word either.
My father had spent every spare penny on his books.  They were his
life.  After the bonfire, I could tell that something had happened to
his mind.

He had to go to many denunciation meetings.  Mrs.  Shau and her group
usually got a large number of Rebels from outside to increase the size
of the crowd and to lend a hand in the violence.  A standard opening
was to chant:

"Ten thousand years, another ten thousand years, and yet another ten
thousand years to our Great Teacher, Great Leader, Great Commander, and
Great Helmsman Chairman Mao!"  Each time the three 'ten thousand's and
four 'great's were shouted out, everyone raised their Litfie Red Books
in unison.  My father would not do this.  He said that the 'ten
thousand years' was how emperors used to be addressed, and it was
unfitting for Chairman Mao, a Communisc

This brought down a torrent of hysterical yells and slaps.

At one meeting, all the targets were ordered to kneel and kowtow to a
huge portrait of Mao at the back of the platform.  While the others did
as they were told, my father refused.  He said that kneeling and
kowtowing were undignified feudal practices which the Communists were
committed to eliminating.  The Rebels screamed, kicked his knees, and
struck him on the head, but he still struggled to stand upright.

"I will not kneel!  I will not kowtowl' he said furiously.  The enraged
crowd demanded, "Bow your head and admit your crimes!"  He replied, "I
have committed no crime.  I will not bend my head!"

Several large young men jumped on him to try to force him down, but as
soon as they let go he stood up straight, raised his head, and stared
defiantly at the audience.  His assailants yanked his hair and pulled
his neck.  My father struggled fiercely.  As the hysterical crowd
screamed that he was 'anti-Culttu'al Revolution," he shouted angrily,
"What kind of Cultural Revolution is this?  There is nothing "cultural"
about it!  There is only brutality!"

The men who were beating him howled, "The Cultural Revolution is led by
Chairman Mao!  How dare you oppose it?"  My father raised his voice
higher: "I do oppose it, even if it is led by Chairman Mao!"

There was total silence.

"Opposing Chairman Mao' was a crime punishable by death.  Many people
had died simply because they had been accused of it, without any
evidence.

The Rebels were stunned to see that my father did not seem to be
afraid.  After they recovered from their initial shock, they began to
beat him again, calling on him to withdraw his blasphemous words.  He
refused.  Enraged, they tied him up and dragged him to the local
police, demanding that they arrest him.  But the policemen there would
not take him.  They liked law and order and Party officials, and hated
the Rebels.  They said they needed permission to arrest an official as
senior as my father, and no one had given such an order.

My father was to be beaten up repeatedly.  But he stuck to his guns. He
was the only person in the compound to behave like this, indeed the
only one I knew of at all, and many people, including Rebels, secretly
admired him.

Every now and then a complete stranger passing us in the street would
murmur stealthily how my father had impressed them.  Some boys told my
brothers they wanted to have bones as strong as my father's.

After their day's torment, both my parents would come home to my
grandmother's nursing hand.  By then, she had set aside her resentment
of my father, and he had also mellowed toward her.  She applied
ointment to his wounds, stuck on special poultices to reduce his
bruising, and got him to drink potions made with a white powder called
bai-yao to help cure his internal injuries.

My parents were under permanent orders to stay at home and wait to be
summoned to the next meeting.  Going into hiding was out of the
question.  The whole of China was like a prison.  Every house, every
street was watched by the people themselves.  In this vast land, there
was nowhere anyone could hide.

My parents could not go out for relaxation either.

"Relaxation' had become an obsolete concept: books, paintings, musical
instruments, sports, cards, chess, teahouses, bars all had disappeared.
The parks were desolate, vandalized wastelands in which the flowers and
the grass had been uprooted and the tame birds and goldfish killed.
Films, plays, and concerts had all been banned: Mme Mao had cleared the
stages and the screens for the eight 'revolutionary operas' which she
had had a hand in producing, and which were all anyone was allowed to
put on.  In the provinces, people did not dare to perform even these. 
One director had been condemned because the makeup he had put on the
torn red hero of one of the operas was considered by Mme Mao to be
excessive.  He was thrown into prison for 'exaggerating the hardship in
the revolutionary struggle."  We hardly even thought of going out for a
walk.

The atmosphere outside was terrifying, with the violent street-corner
denunciation meetings and all the sinister wall posters and slogans;
people were walking around like zombies, with harsh or cowed
expressions on their faces.

What was more, my parents' bruised faces marked them as condemned, and
if they went out they ran the risk of being abused.

As an indication of the terror of the day, no one dared to burn or
throw away any newspapers.  Every front page carried Mao's portrait,
and every few lines featured Mao's quotations.  These papers had to be
treasured and it would bring disaster if anyone saw you disposing of
them.  Keeping them was also a problem: mice might gnaw into Mao's
portrait, or the papers might simply rot either of these would be
interpreted as a crime against Mao.  Indeed, the first large-scale
factional fighting in Chengdu was triggered by some Red Guards
accidentally sitting on old newspapers which had Mao's face on them.  A
schoolfriend of my mother's was hounded to suicide because she wrote
"Heartily love Chairman Mao' on a wall poster with one brush stroke
inadvertently shorter, making the character 'heartily' look like the
one meaning 'sadly."

One day in February 1967, in the depths of this overwhelming terror, my
parents had a long conversation which I only came to know about years
later.  My mother was sitting on the edge of their bed, and my father
was in a wicker chair opposite.  He told her that he now knew what the
Cultural Revolution was really about, and the realization had shattered
his whole world.  He could see clearly that it had nothing to do with
democratization, or with giving ordinary people more say.  It was a
bloody purge to increase Mao's personal power.

My father talked slowly and deliberately, choosing his words
carefully.

"But Chairman Mao has always been so magnanimous," my mother said.

"He even spared Pu Yi.

Why can't he tolerate his comrades-in-arms who fought for a new China
with him?  How can he be so harsh on them?"

My father said quietly, but intensely, "What was Pu Yi?

He was a war criminal, with no support from the people.

He couldn't do anything.  But..."  He fell into a meaningful silence.
My mother understood him: Mao would not tolerate any possible
challenge.  Then she asked, "But why all of us, who after all only
carry out orders?  And why incriminate all these innocent people?  And
so much destruction and suffering?"

My father replied, "Maybe Chairman Mao feels he could not achieve his
goal without turning the whole place upside down.  He has always been
thorough and he has never been fainthearted about casualties."

After a charged pause, my father went on: "This cannot be a revolution
in any sense of the term.  To secure personal power at such cost to the
country and the people has to be wrong.  In fact, I think it is
criminal."

My mother scented disaster.  After reasoning like this, her husband had
to act.  As she expected, he said, "I am going to write a letter to
Chairman Mao."

My mother dropped her head into her hands.

"What's the use?"  she burst out.

"How could you possibly imagine Chairman Mao would listen to you?  Why
do you want to destroy yourself- and for nothing?  Don't count on me to
take it to Peking this time!"

My father leaned over and kissed her.

"I wasn't thinking about your delivering it.  I'm going to post it."
Then he lifted her head and looked into her eyes.  In a tone of despair
he said, 'what else can I do?  what alternatives do I have?  I must
speak up.  It might help.  And I must do it even if just for my
conscience."

"Why is your conscience so important?"  my mother said.

"More than your children?  Do you want them to become "blacks"?"

There was a long pause.  Then my father said hesitantly, "I suppose you
must divorce me and bring up the children your way."  Silence fell
between them again, making her think that perhaps he had not made up
his mind about writing the letter, because he was aware of its
consequences.  It would surely be catastrophic.

Days passed.  In late February, an airplane flew low over Chengdu
spreading thousands of sparkling sheets which floated down out of the
leaden sky.  On them was printed a copy of a letter dated 17 February
and signed by the Central Military Committee, the top body of senior
army men.  The letter told the Rebels to desist from their violent
actions.  Although it did not condemn the Cultural Revolution directly,
it was obviously trying to halt it.  A colleague showed the leaflet to
my mother.  My parents had a surge of hope.  Perhaps China's old and
much-respected marshals were going to intervene.  There was a big
demonstration through the streets of central Chengdu in support of the
marshals' call.

The leaflets were the result of upheavals behind closed doors in
Peking.  In late January Mao had for the first time called on the army
to support the Rebels.  Most of the top military leaders except Defense
Minister Lin Biao were furious.  On 14 and 16 February, they held two
long meetings with political leaders.  Mao himself stayed away, as did
Lin Biao, his deputy.  Zhou Enlai presided.  The marshals joined forces
with Politburo members who had not yet been purged.  These marshals had
been the commanders of the Communist army, veterans of the Long March,
and heroes of the revolution.  They condemned the Cultural Revolution
for persecuting innocent people and destabilizing the country.  One of
the vice-premiers, Tan Zhenlin, burst out in a fury, "I've followed
Chairman Mao all my life.  Now I'm not following him anymore!"
Immediately after these meetings the marshals began to take steps to
try to stop the violence.  Because it was particularly bad in Sichuan,
they issued the letter of 17 February especially for the province.

Zhou Enlai declined to throw his weight behind the majority, and stuck
with Mao.  The personality cult had endowed Mao with demonic power.
Retribution against

!:

the opposition was swift.  Mao stage-managed mob attacks on the
dissident Politburo members and military commanders, who were subjected
to house raids and brutal denunciation meetings.  When Mao gave the
word to punish the marshals, the army did not make a move to support
them.

This single feeble attempt to stand up to Mao and his Cultural
Revolution was termed the "February Adverse Current."  The regime
released a selective account of it to generate more intense violence
against the capitalistroaders.

The February meetings were a turning point for Mao.

He saw that virtually everyone opposed his policies.  This led to the
total discarding in all but name of the Party.

The Politburo was effectively replaced by the Cultural Revolution
Authority.  Lin Biao soon began to purge commanders loyal to the
marshals, and the role of the Central Military Committee was taken over
by his personal office, which he controlled through his wife.  Mao's
cabal now was like a medieval court, structured around wives, cousins,
and fawning courtiers.  Mao sent delegates to the provinces to organize
"Revolutionary Committees," which were to be the new instruments of his
personal power, replacing the Party system all the way down to the
grass roots.

In Sichuan, Mao's delegates turned out to be my parents' old
acquaintances, the Tings.  After my family had left Yibin, the Tings
had practically taken control of the region.  Mr.  Ting had become its
Party secretary; Mrs.  Ting was Party chief of the city of Yibin, the
capital.

The Tings had used their positions to engage in endless persecutions
and personal vendettas.  One involved a man who had been Mrs.  Ting's
bodyguard in the early 195os.

She had tried to seduce him several times, and one day she complained
about having stomach trouble and got the young man to massage her
abdomen.  Then she guided his hand down to her private parts.  The
bodyguard immediately pulled his hand back and walked away.  Mrs.  Ting
accused him of trying to rape her and had him sentenced to three years
in a labor camp.

An anonymous letter exposing the whole affair reached the Sichuan Party
Committee, which ordered an investigation.  Being the defendants, the
Tings were not supposed to see this letter, but a crony of theirs
showed it to them.

They got every member of the Yibin government to write a report on some
issue or other in order to check their handwriting.  They were never
able to identify the author, but the investigation came to nothing.

In Yibin, officials and ordinary people alike were terrified of the
Tings.  The recurrent political campaigns and the quota system provided
ideal opportunities for them to engage in victimization.

In 1959 the Tings got rid of the governor of Yibin, the man who had
succeeded my father in 1953.  He was a veteran of the Long March, and
was very popular, which made the Tings'envious.  He was called "Straw
Sandal Li' because he always wore peasant's sandals a sign that he
wanted to keep close to his roots in the soil.  Indeed, during the
Great Leap Forward, he showed little alacrity in forcing the peasants
to produce steel, and in 1959 he spoke up about the famine.  The Tings
denounced him as a 'rightist opportunist' and had him demoted to
purchasing agent for the canteen of a brewery.  He died in the famine,
although his job should have meant he had a better opportunity to fill
his stomach than most.  The autopsy showed there was only straw in his
stomach.  He had remained an honest man to his death.

Another case, also in 1959, involved a doctor whom the Tings condemned
as a class enemy because he made a truthful diagnosis of hunger victims
and the famine was officially unmentionable.

There were scores of cases like these so many that people risked their
lives to write to the provincial authorities to denounce the Tings.  In
1962, when the moderates had the upper hand in the central government,
they launched a nationwide investigation into the previous campaigns
and rehabilitated many of the victims.  A team was formed by the
Sichuan government to investigate the Tings, who were found guilty of
gross abuse of power.

They were sacked and detained, and in 1965 General Secretary Deng
Xiaoping signed an order expelling them from the Party.

When the Cultural Revolution started, the Tings somehow escaped and got
to Peking, where they appealed to the Cultural Revolution Authority.
They presented themselves as heroes upholding 'class struggle," for
which, they claimed, they had been persecuted by the old Party
authorities.  My mother actually bumped into them once at the grievance
office.  They asked her warmly for her address in Peking.  She declined
to give it to them.

The Tings were picked up by Chen Boda, one of the leaders of the
Cultural Revolution Authority, and my father's old boss in Yan'an.
Through him, Mme Mao received them, and immediately recognized them as
kindred spirits.  Mme Mao's motivation for the Cultural Revolution had
much less to do with policy than with set fling personal scores some of
the pettiest kind.  She had a hand in the persecution of Mme Liu Shaoqi
because, as she herself told the Red Guards, she was furious about Mme
Liu's overseas trips with her husband, the president.  Mao only went
abroad twice, both times to Russia, and both times without Mme Mao.
What was worse, on her trips abroad Mme Liu was seen wearing smart
clothes and jewelry that no one could wear in Mao's austere China.

Mme Liu was accused of being a CIA agent and thrown into prison, barely
escaping death.

Back in the 193os, before she had met Mao, Mme Mao had been a minor
actress in Shanghai, and had felt cold-shouldered by the lite raft
there.  Some of them were Communist underground leaders, who after 1949
became leading figures in the Central Department of Public Affairs.
Partly to avenge her real or imagined humiliation in

Shanghai thirty years before, Mme Mao went to extreme lengths to find
'anti-Chairman Mao, anti-socialist' elements in their work.  As Mao
went into retreat during the famine, she managed to get closer to him
and whispered much venomous pillow talk in his ear.  In order to bring
her foes down, she condemned the entire system under them, which meant
the departments of Public Affairs all over the country.

She also took revenge on actors and actresses from the Shanghai period
who had aroused her jealousy.  An actress called Wang Ying had played a
role which Mme Mao had coveted.  Thirty years later, in 1966, Mme Mao
had her and her husband imprisoned for life.  Wang Ying committed
suicide in prison in 1974.

Another well-known actress, Sun Wei-shi, had once appeared decades
before with Mine Mao in a play in Yan'an in front of Mao.  Sun's
performance was apparently more of a hit than Mme Mao's, and she became
a very popular figure among the top leaders, including Mao.

Being Zhou Enlai's adopted daughter, she did not feel the need to
butter up Mme Mao.  In 1968, Mme Mao had her and her brother arrested
and tortured to death.  Even Zhou Enlai's power could not protect
her.

Mme Mao's vendettas gradually became known to the general public by
word of mouth; her character also revealed itself in her speeches,
which were reproduced on wall posters.  She was to become almost
universally hated, but at the beginning of 1967 her evils were still
little known.

Mme Mao and the Tings belonged to the same breed, who had a name in
Mao's China -zheng-ren, people persecuting officials."  The
tirelessness and single mindedness with which they engaged in
persecution, and the bloodthirsty methods they used, were on a truly
horrific scale.  In March 1967, a document signed by Mao announced that
the Tings had been rehabilitated and empowered to organize the Sichuan
Revolutionary Committee.

A transitional authority called the Sichuan Preparatory

Revolutionary Committee was set up.  It was composed of two generals
the chief political commissar and the commander of the Chengdu Military
Region (one of

China's eight military regions) and the Tings.  Mao had decreed that
every Revolutionary Committee should have three components: the local
army, representatives of the

Rebels, and 'revolutionary officials."  The latter were to be chosen
from among former officials, and this was at the discretion of the
Tings, who were in effect running the committee.

In late March 1967 the Tings came to see my father.

They wanted to include him in their committee.  My father enjoyed high
prestige among his colleagues for being honest and fair.  Even the
Tings appreciated his qualities, particularly as they knew that when
they had been in disgrace my father had not, like some, added his
personal denunciations.  Besides, they needed someone with his
abilities.

My father greeted them as courtesy required, but my 'grandmother
welcomed them with enthusiasm.  She had heard lit He about their
vendettas, and she knew that it was Mrs.  Ting who had authorized the
precious American medicines which had cured my mother of TB when she
was pregnant with me.

When the Tings went into my father's quarters, my grandmother quickly
rolled out some dough, and soon the loud rhythmic melody of chopping
filled the kitchen.  She minced pork, cut a bundle of tender young
chives, hashed an assortment of spices, and poured hot rapeseed oil
onto chili powder to make the sauce for the traditional welcoming meal
of dumplings.

In my father's study, the Tings told him about their rehabilitation and
their new status.  They said they had been to his deparisaaent and been
briefed by the Rebels there about the trouble he had gotten himself
into.  However, they said, they had always liked him in those early
years in Yibin, still had high regard for him, and wanted to work with
him again.  They promised that all the incriminating things he had said
and done could be forgotten if he cooperated.  Not only that, he could
rise again in the new power structure, taking charge of all cultural
affairs in Sichuan, for example.  They made it clear it was an offer he
could not afford to refuse.

My father had heard about the Tings' appointment from my mother, who
had read it on wall posters.  He had said to my mother at the time: "We
mustn't believe in rumors.

This is impossible!"  It was incredible to him to see this couple
placed in vital positions by Mao.  Now he tried to restrain his
disgust, and said, "I'm sorry, I can't accept your offer."

Mrs.  Ting snapped, "We are doing you a big favor.  Other people would
have begged for this on their knees.  Do you realize what a spot you
are in, and who we are now?"

My father's anger rose.  He said, "Whatever I have said or done I take
responsibility for myself.  I do not want to get mixed up with you." In
the heated exchanges that followed, he went on to say that he thought
their punishment had been just, and they should never have been trusted
with important jobs.  Stunned, they told ~ to be careful what he said:
it was Chairman Mao himself who had rehabilitated them and had called
them 'good officials."

My father's outrage spurred him on.

"But Chairman Mao could not have known all the facts about you.  What
sort of' good officials" are you?  You have committed unforgivable
mistakes."  He checked himself from saying 'crimes."

"How dare you challenge Chairman Mao's words!"

exclaimed Mrs.  Ting.

"Deputy Commander Lin Biao said:

"Every word of Chairman Mao's is universal absolute truth, and every
word equals ten thousand words"!"

"If a word means one word," my father said, 'it is already a man's
supreme achievement.  It is not humanly possible for one word to mean
ten thousand.  What Deputy Commander Lin Biao said was rhetorical, and
should not be taken literally."

The Tings could not believe their ears, according to their account
afterward.  They warned my father that his way of thinking, talking,
and behaving was against the Cultural Revolution, which was led by
Chairman Mao.  To this my father said he would like a chance to debate
with Chairman Mao about the whole thing.  These words were so suicidal
that the Tings were speechless.  After a silence, they stood up to
leave.

My grandmother heard angry footsteps and rushed out of the kitchen, her
hands dusted with wheat flour into which she had been dipping the
dumplings.  She collided with Mrs.  Ting and asked the couple to stay
for lunch.

Mrs.  Ting ignored her, stormed out of the apartment, and started to
tramp downstairs.  At the landing she stopped, turned around, and said
furiously to my father, who had come out with them, "Are you crazy? I'm
asking you for the last time: Do you still refuse my help?  You realize
I can do anything to you now."

"I want nothing to do with you," my father said.

"You and I are different species."

Leaving my star fled and fearful grandmother at the top of the stairs,
my father went into his study.  He came out almost at once, and carried
an ink stone to the bathroom.

He dripped a few drops of water onto the stone and walked thoughtfully
back into the study.  Then he sat down at his desk, and started
grinding a stick of ink round and round the stone, forming a thick
black liquid.  He spread a blank sheet of paper in front of him.  In no
time, he had finished his second letter to Mao.  He started by saying:
"Chairman Mao, I appeal to you, as one Communist to another, to stop
the Cultural Revolution."  He went on to describe the disasters into
which it had thrown China.  The letter ended with the words: "I fear
the worst for our Party and our country if people like Liu Jie-ting and
Zhang Xi-ting are given power over the lives of tens of millions of
people."

He addressed the envelope to "Chairman Mao, Peking," and took it to the
post office at the top of the street.  He sent it by registered
airmail.  The clerk behind the counter took the envelope and glanced at
it, maintaining an expression of total blankness.  Then my father
walked home to wait.

20.  '1 Will Not Sell My Soul' My Father Arrested

(1967-1968)

On the afternoon of the third day after my father posted his letter to
Mao, my mother answered a knock on the door of our apartment.  Three
men came in, all wearing the same baggy blue uniform like clothes as
every other man in China.  My father knew one of them: he had been a
caretaker in his department and was a militant Rebel.

One of the others, a tall man with boils on his thin face, announced
that they were Rebels from the police and that they had come to arrest
him, 'a counterrevolutionary in action bombarding Chairman Mao and the
Cultural Revolution."  Then he and the third man, who was shorter and
stouter, gripped my father by the arms, and gestured to him to go.

They did not show any identity cards, much less an arrest warrant.  But
there was no doubt that they were Rebel plainclothes policemen.  Their
authority was unquestionable, because they came with a Rebel from my
father's department.

Although they did not mention his letter to Mao, my father knew it must
have been intercepted, as was almost inevitable.  He had known that he
would probably be arrested, because not only had he committed his
blasphemy to paper, but there was now an authority the Tings to
sanction his arrest.  Even so, he had wanted to take the only chance
there was, however slight.  He was silent and tense, but did not
protest.  As he was walking out of the apartment, he paused and said
softly to my mother: "Don't bear a grudge against our Party.  Have
faith that it will correct its mistakes, however grave they may be.
Divorce me and give my love to our children.  Don't alarm them."

When I came home later that afternoon, I found both of my parents gone.
My grandmother told me my mother had gone to Peking to appeal for my
father, who had been taken away by Rebels from his par anent  She did
not say 'the police," because that would have been too frightening,
being more disastrous and final than detention by Rebels.

I rushed to my father's deparl,nent to ask where he was.

I got no answer except assorted barks, led by Mrs.  Shau, of "You must
draw a line from your stinking capitalist-roader father' and "Wherever
he is, it serves him right."  I forced back my furious tears.  I was
filled with loathing for these supposedly intelligent adults.  They did
not have to be so merciless, so brutal.  A kinder look, a gentler tone,
or even silence would have been perfectly possible, even in those
days.

It was from this time that I developed my way of judging the Chinese by
dividing them into two kinds: one humane, and one not.  It took an
upheaval like the Cultural Revolution to bring out these
characteristics in people, whether they were teenage Red Guards, adult
Rebels, or capitalistroaders.

Meanwhile, my mother was waiting at the station for the train that was
to take her to Peking a second time.  She felt much more despondent now
than six months before.

There had still been a chance for some justice then, but it was
virtually hopeless now.  My mother did not give in to despair.  She was
determined to fight.

She had decided that the one person she had to see was

L~

Premier Zhou Enlai.  No one else would do.  If she sa~ anyone else it
would only hasten the demise of her husband, herself, and her family.
She knew that Zhou was tar more moderate than Mme Mao and the Cultural
Revolution Authority and that he exercised considerable power over the
Rebels, to whom he gave orders almost even' day.

But getting to see him was like trying to walk into the White House, or
see the Pope alone.  Even if she reached Peking without being caught,
and got to the right grievance office, she could not specify whom she
wanted to see, as that would be taken as an insult to, even an attack
on, other leaders.  Her anxiety grew, and she did not know whether her
absence from home had already been discovered by the Rebels.  She was
meant to be waiting to be summoned to her next denunciation meeting,
but there was a possible loophole.  One Rebel group might think she was
in the hands of another.

As she waited, she saw a huge banner with the words "The Red Chengdu
Petition Delegation to Peking."  Clustered around it was a crowd of
about 200 people in their early twenties.  Their other banners made it
clear they were university students, going to Peking to protest against
the Tings.  What was more, the banners proclaimed that they had secured
a meeting with Premier Zhou.

Compared with its rival Rebel group, 26 August, Red Chengdu was
relatively moderate.  The Tings had thrown their weight behind 26
August, but Red Chengdu did not surrender.  The power of the Tings was
never absolute, even though they were backed by Mao and the Cultural
Revolution Authority.

At this time, the Cultural Revolution was dominated by intense
factional fighting between Rebel groups.  This had begun almost as soon
as Mao had given the signal to seize power from the capitalist-roaders;
now, three months later, most of the Rebel leaders were emerging as
something very different from the ousted Communist officials: they were
undisciplined opportunists, and were not even fanatical Maoists.  Mao
had instructed them to unite and share power, but they only paid lip
service to this injunction.

They verbally attacked each other with Mao's quotations, making cynical
use of his guru-like elusiveness it was easy to select a quotation of
Mao's to suit any situation, or even both sides of the same argument.
Mao knew that his vapid 'philosophy' was boomeranging on him, but he
could not intervene explicitly without losing his mystical
remoteness.

In order to destroy 26 August, Red Chengdu knew it had to bring down
the Tings.  They knew the Tings' reputation for vindictiveness and
their lust for power, which were widely discussed, in hushed tones by
some, more openly by others.  Even Mao's endorsement of the couple was
not enough to get Red Chengdu to fall into line.  It was against this
background that Red Chengdu was sending the students to Peking.  Zhou
Enlai had promised to receive them because Red Chengdu, as one of the
two Rebel camps in Sichuan, had millions of supporters.

My mother followed the Red Chengdu crowd as they were waved through the
ticket barrier onto the platform where the Peking express was puffing.
She was trying to climb into a carriage with them when she was stopped
by a male student.

"Who are you?"  he shouted.  My mother, at thirty-five, hardly looked
like a student.

"You're not one of us.  Get off{'

My mother clung tightly to the handle of the door.

"I am going to Peking, too, to appeal against the Tings{' she cried.

"I know them from the past."  The man looked at her in disbelief.  But
from behind him came two voices, a man's and a woman's: "Let her in{
Let's hear what she has to say{'

My mother squeezed into the packed compartment, and was seated between
the man and the woman.  They introduced themselves as staff officers of
Red Chengdu.  The man was called Yong, and the woman Yan.  They were
both students at Chengdu University.

j~

From what they said, my mother could see that the students did not know
very much about the Tings.  She told them what she could remember about
some of the many cases of persecution in Yibin before the Cultural
Revolution; about Mrs.  Ting's attempt to seduce my father in 1953; the
couple's recent visit to my father, and his refusal to collaborate with
them.  She said the Tings had had my father arrested because he had
written to Chairman Mao to oppose their appointment as the new leaders
of Sichuan.

Yan and Yong promised they would take her to their meeting with Zhou
Enlai.  All night, my mother sat wide awake planning what she should
say to him, and how.

When the delegation arrived at Peking Station, a representative of the
premier was waiting for them.  They were taken to a government
guesthouse, and told that Zhou would see them the next evening.

The next day, while the students were out, my mother prepared a written
plea to Zhou.  She might not get a chance to talk to him, and in any
case it was better to petition him in writing.  At 9 p.m. she went with
the students to the Great Hall of the People on the west side of
Tiananmen Square.  The meeting was in the Sichuan Room, which my father
had helped decorate in 1959.  The students sat in an arc facing the
premier.  There were not enough seats, so some sat on the carpeted
floor.  My mother sat in the back row.

She knew her speech had to be succinct and effective, and she rehearsed
it again in her head as the meeting got under way.  She was too
preoccupied to hear what the students were saying.  She only noted how
the premier reacted.  Every now and then he nodded acknowledgment.

He never indicated approval or disagreement.  He just listened, and
occasionally made general remarks about 'following Chairman Mao' and
'the need to unite."  An aide took notes.

Suddenly she heard the premier saying, as though in conclusion:
"Anything else?"  She shot up from her seat.

"Premier, I have something to say."

Zhou raised his eyes.  My mother was obviously not a student.

"Who are you?"  he asked.  My mother gave her name and position, and
followed immediately with: "My husband has been arrested as a
"counterrevolutionary in action."  I am here to seek justice for him."
She then gave my father's name and position.

Zhou's eyes became intent.  My father had an important position.

"The students can go," he said.

"I'll talk to you privately."

My mother longed to talk to Zhou alone, but she had decided to
sacrifice this chance for a more important goal.

"Premier, I would like the students to stay to be my witnesses."  While
saying this, she handed her petition to the student in front, who
passed it on to Zhou.

The premier nodded: "All right.  Go ahead."

Quickly but clearly, my mother said my father had been arrested for
what he had written in a letter to Chairman Mao.  My father disagreed
with the Tings' appointment as the new leaders of Sichuan, because of
their record of abuse of power which he had witnessed in Yibin.  Apart
from that, she said briefly: "My husband's letter also contained
serious mistakes about the Cultural Revolution."

She had thought carefully about how she would put this.

She had to give a true account to Zhou, but she could not repeat my
father's exact words for fear of the Rebels.  She had to be as abstract
as possible: "My husband held some seriously erroneous views.  However,
he did not spread his views in public.  He was following the charter of
the Communist Party and speaking his mind to Chairman Mao.  According
to the charter, this is the legitimate right of a Party member, and
should not be used as an excuse to arrest him.  I am here to appeal for
justice for him."

When my mother's eyes met Zhou Enlai's, she saw that he had fully
understood the real content of my father's letter, and her dilemma of
not being able to spell it out.

He glanced at my mother's petition, then turned to an aide sitting
behind him and whispered something.  The hall was deadly quiet.  All
eyes were on the premier.

The aide handed Zhou some sheets of paper with the letterhead of the
State Council (the cabinet).  Zhou started writing in his slightly
strained way his right arm had been broken years before when he fell
from a horse in Yan'an.

When he finished, he gave the paper to the aide, who read it out.

'"One: As a Communist Party member, Chang Shou-yu is entitled to write
to the Party leadership.  No matter what serious mistakes the letter
contains, it may not be used to accuse him of being a
counterrevolutionary.  Two: As Deputy Director of the Depaximent of
Public Affairs of Sichuan Province, Chang Shou-yu has to submit himself
to investigation and criticism by the people.  Three: Any final
adjudication on Chang Shou-yu must wait fill the end of the Cultural
Revolution.  Zhou Enlai."

My mother was speechless with relief.  The note was not addressed to
the new leaders in Sichuan, which would normally have been the case, so
she was not bound to hand it in to them, or to anyone.  Zhou intended
her to keep it and show it to whoever might prove useful.

Yan and Yong were sitting on my mother's left.  When she turned to
them, she saw they were beaming with joy.

She caught the train back to Chengdu two days later, keeping with Yan
and Yong all the time, as she was worried the Tings might get wind of
the note and send their henchmen to grab it and her.  Yan and Yong also
thought it was vital for her to stick with them, "In case z6 August
abducts you."  They insisted on accompanying her to our apactment from
the station.  My grandmother gave them pork-and chive pancakes, which
they devoured in no time.

I immediately took to Yan and Yong.  Rebels, and yet so kind, so
friendly and warm to my family!  It was unbelievable.  I could also
tell at once that they were in love: the way they glanced at each
other, the way they teased and touched each other, was very unusual in
company.  I heard my grandmother sigh to my mother that it would be
nice to give them some presents for their wedding.  My mother said this
would be impossible, and would get them into trouble if it became
known.  Accepting 'bribes' from a capitalist-roader was no small
offense.

Yan was twenty-four, and had been in her third year studying accounting
at Chengdu University.  Her lively face was dominated by a pair of
thick-rimmed spectacles.  She laughed frequently, throwing her head
back.  It was a very heart-warming laugh.  In China in those days,
dark-blue or gray jacket and trousers were the standard gear for men,
women, and children.  No pan ems were allowed.  In spite of the
uniformity, some women managed to wear their clothes with signs of care
and thoughtfulness.  But not Yan.

She always looked as though she had put her buttons in the wrong holes,
and her short hair was pulled back impatiently into an untidy tail.  It
seemed that not even being in love could induce her to pay attention to
her looks.

Yong looked more fashion conscious.  He wore a pair of straw sandals,
which were set off by rolled-up trouser legs.

Straw sandals were a sort of fashion among some students because of
their association with the peasants.  Yong seemed exceedingly
intelligent and sensitive.  I was fascinated by him.

After a happy meal, Yan and Yong took their leave.  My mother walked
downstairs with them, and they whispered to her that she must keep Zhou
Enlai's note in a safe place.

My mother said nothing to me or my siblings about her meeting with
Zhou.

That evening, my mother went to see an old colleague of hers and showed
him Zhou's note.  Chen Mo had worked with my parents in Yibin in the
early 195os, and got on well with both of them.  He had also managed to
maintain a good relationship with the Tings, and when they were
rehabilitated he threw in his lot with them.  My

3/I3, Father:~Irrested 46 l mother asked him, in tears, to help secure
my father's release for old times' sake, and he promised to have a word
with the Tings.

Time passed, and then, in April, my father suddenly reappeared.  I was
tremendously relieved and happy to see him, but almost immediately my
joy turned to horror.

There was a strange light in his eyes.  He would not say where he had
been, and when he did speak, I could hardly understand his words.  He
was sleepless for days and nights on end, and paced up and down the
apartment, talking to himself.  One day he forced the whole family to
go and stand in the pouring rain, telling us this was 'to experience
the revolutionary storm."  Another day, after collecting his salary
packet, he threw it into the kitchen stove, saying that this was 'to
break with private property."  The dreadful truth dawned on us: my
father had gone insane.

My mother became the focus of his madness.  He raged at her, calling
her 'shameless," 'a coward," and accusing her of 'selling her soul."
Then, without warning, he would become embarrassingly loving toward her
in front of the rest of us saying over and over again how much he loved
her, how he had been an unworthy husband, and begging her to 'forgive
me and come back to me."

On his first day back he had looked at my mother suspiciously and asked
her what she had been doing.  She told him she had been to Peking to
appeal for his release.  He shook his head incredulously, and asked her
to produce evidence.  She decided not to tell him about the note from
Zhou Enlai.  She could see he was not himself, and was worried he might
hand in the note, even to the Tings, if 'the Party' ordered him to. She
could not even name Yan and Yong as her witnesses: my father would
think it was wrong to get involved with a Red Guard faction.

He kept coming back to the issue obsessively.  Every day he would
cross-examine my mother, and apparent inconsistencies emerged in her
story.  My father's suspicion and confusion grew.  His rage toward my
mother began to verge on violence.  My siblings and I wanted to help my
mother, and tried to make her story, about which we were vague
ourselves, sound more convincing.  Of course, when my father started to
question us, it became even more muddled.

What had happened was that while my father was in prison, his
interrogators had constantly told him he would be deserted by his wife
and family if he did not write his 'confession."  Insisting on
confessions was a standard practice.  Forcing victims to admit their
'guilt' was vital in crushing their morale.  But my father said he had
nothing to confess, and would not write anything.

His interrogators then told him that my mother had denounced him.  When
he asked for her to be allowed to visit him, he was told she had been
given permission, but had refused, to show that she was 'drawing a
line' between herself and him.  When the interrogators realized that my
father was beginning to hear things a sign of schizophrenia- they drew
his attention to a faint buzz of conversation from the next room,
saying that my mother was in there, but would not see him unless he
wrote his confession.  The interrogators play-acted so vividly that my
father thought he really heard my mother's voice.  His mind began to
collapse.  Still he would not write the confession.

As he was being released, one of his interrogators told him he was
being allowed home to be kept under the eyes of his wife, 'who has been
assigned by the Party to watch you."  Home, he was told, was to be his
new prison.  He did not know the reason for his sudden release, and in
his confusion he latched onto this explanation.

My mother knew nothing about what had happened to him in prison.  When
my father asked her why he had been released, she could not give him a
satisfactory answer.  Not only could she not tell him about Zhou
Enlai's note, she could not mention going to see Chen Mo, who was the
right-hand man of the Tings.  My father would not have tolerated his
wife's 'begging for a favor' from the Tings.

In this vicious circle, both my mother's dilemma and my father's
insanity grew, and fed off each other.

My mother tried to get medical treatment for him.  She went to the
clinic that had been attached to the old provincial government.  She
tried the mental hospitals.  But as soon as the people at the
registration desks heard my father's name, they shook their heads. They
could not take him without sanction from the authorities and they were
not prepared to ask for that themselves.

My mother went to the dominant Rebel group in my father's department
and asked them to authorize hospitalization.  This was the group led by
Mrs.  Shau, and firmly in the hands of the Tings.  Mrs.  Shau snarled
at my mother that my father was faking mental illness in order to
escape his punishment, and that my mother was helping him, using her
own medical background (her stepfather, Dr.  Xia, having been a
doctor).  My father was 'a dog that has fallen into the water, and must
be flogged and beaten with absolutely no charity," said one Rebel,
quoting a current slogan vaunting the merciless ness of the Cultural
Revolution.

Under instructions from the Tings, the Rebels hounded my father with a
wall-poster campaign.  Apparently, the Tings had reported to Mme Mao
the 'criminal words' my father had used at the denunciation meeting, in
his conversation with them, and in his letter to Mao.  According to the
posters, Mme Mao had risen to her feet in indignation and said, "For
the man who dares to attack the Great Leader so blatantly,
imprisonment, even the death sentence, is too kind!  He must be
thoroughly punished before we have done with him!"

The terror such wall posters induced in me was immense.  Mme Mao had
denounced my father!  This was surely the end for him.  But,
paradoxically, one of Mme Mao's evil traits was actually to help us:
Mme Mao was more dedicated to her personal vendettas than to real
issues, and because she did not know my father and had no personal
grudge against him, she did not pursue him.

We were not to know this, however, and I tried to take comfort in the
thought that her reported comment might only be a rumor.  In theory,
wall posters were unofficial, since they were written by the 'masses'
and not part of the official media.  But, deep down, I knew that what
they said was tale.

With the Tings' venom and Mme Mao's condemnation, the Rebels'
denunciation meetings became more brutal, even though my father was
still allowed to live at home.

One day he came back with one of his eyes badly damaged.

Another day I saw him standing on a slow-moving truck, being paraded
through the streets.  A huge placard hung from a thin wire that was
eating into his neck, and his arms were twisted ferociously behind his
back.  He was struggling to keep his head up under the forceful pushing
of some Rebels.  What made me saddest of all was that he appeared
indifferent to his physical pain.  In his insanity, his mind seemed to
be detached from his body.

He tore to pieces any photographs in the family album which had the
Tings in them.  He burned his quilt covers and sheets, and much of the
family's clothing.  He broke the legs of chairs and tables and burned
them, too.

One afternoon my mother was having a rest on their bed and Father was
reclining on his favorite bamboo armchair in his study, when he
suddenly jumped up and stamped into the bedroom.  We heard the banging
and dashed after him and found him gripping my mother's neck.  We
screamed and tried to pull him away.  It looked as if my mother was
going to be strangled.  But then he let go with a jerk, and strode out
of the room.

My mother sat up slowly, her face ashen.  She cupped her left ear in
her hand.  My father had awakened her by striking her on the side of
the head.  Her voice was weak, but she was calm.

"Don't worry, I'm all right," she said to my sobbing grandmother.  Then
she turned to us and said, "See how your father is.  Then go to your
rooms."  She leaned back against the oval mirror framed in camphor wood
which formed the headboard of the bed.  In the mirror I saw her right
hand clutching the pillow.  My grandmother sat by my parents' door all
night.  I could not sleep either.  What would happen if my father
attacked my mother with their door locked?

My mother's left ear was permanently damaged, and became almost totally
deaf.  She decided it was too dangerous for her to stay at home, and
the next day she went to her department to find a place to move to. The
Rebels there were very sympathetic.  They gave her a room in the
gardener's lodge in the corner of the garden.  It was terribly small,
about eight feet by ten.  Only a bed and a desk could be squeezed in,
with no space even to walk between them.

That night, I slept there with my mother, my grandmother, and
Xiao-fang, all crammed together on the bed.

We could not stretch our legs or turn.  The bleeding from my mother's
womb worsened.  We were very frightened because, having just moved to
this new place, we had no stove and could not sterilize the syringe and
needle, and therefore could not give her an injection.  In the end, I
was so exhausted I dropped into a fitful sleep.  But I knew that
neither my grandmother nor my mother closed their eyes.

Over the next few days, while Jin-ming went on living with Father, I
stayed at my mother's new place helping to look after her.  Living in
the next room was a young Rebel leader from my mother's district.  I
had not said hello to him because I was not sure whether he would want
to be spoken to by someone from the family of a capitalistroader, but
to my surprise he greeted us normally when we ran into each other.  He
treated my mother with courtesy, although he was a bit stiff.  This was
a great relief after the ostentatious frostiness of the Rebels in my
father's department.

One morning a couple of days after we moved in, my mother was washing
her face under the eaves because there was no space inside when this
man called out to her and asked if she would like to swap rooms.  His
was twice as big as ours.  We moved that afternoon.  He also helped us
to get another bed so we could sleep in relative comfort.

We were very touched.

This young man had a severe squint and a very pretty girlfriend who
stayed overnight with him, which was almost unheard of in those days.
They did not seem to mind us knowing.  Of course, capitalist-roaders
were in no position to tell tales.  When I bumped into them in the
mornings, they always gave me a very kind smile which told me they were
happy.  I realized then that when people are happy they become kind.

When my mother's health improved, I went back to Father.  The apartment
was in a dreadful state: the windows were broken, and there were bits
of burned furniture and clothing all over the floor.  My father seemed
indifferent to whether I was there or not; he just paced incessantly
around and around.  At night I locked my bedroom door, because he could
not sleep and would insist on talking to me, endlessly, without making
sense.  But there was a small window over the door which could not be
locked.  One night I woke up to see him slithering through the tiny
aperture and jumping nimbly to the floor.

But he paid no attention to me.  He aimlessly picked up various pieces
of heavy mahogany furniture and let them drop with seemingly little
effort.  In his insanity he had become super humanly agile and
powerful. Staying with him was a nightmare.  Many times, I wanted to
run away to my mother, but I could not bring myself to leave him.

A couple of times he slapped me, which he had never done before, and I
would go and hide in the back garden under the balcony of the
apartment.  In the chill of the spring nights I listened desperately
for the silence upstairs which meant he had gone to sleep.

One day, I missed his presence.  I was seized by a presentiment and
rushed out of the door.  A neighbor who

?

lived on the top floor was walking down the stairs.  We had stopped
greeting each other some time before in order to avoid trouble, but
this time he said: "I saw your father going out onto the roof."

Our apattsnent block had five stories.  I raced to the top floor.  On
the landing to the left a small window gave onto the flat, shingled
roof of the four-story block next door.

The roof had low iron rails around the edge.  As I was trying to climb
through the window, I saw my father at the edge of the roof.  I thought
I saw him lifting his left leg over the railing.

"Father," I called, in a voice which was trembling, although I was
trying to force it to sound normal.  My instinct told me I must not
alarm him.

He paused, and turned toward me: "What are you doing here?"

"Please come and help me get through the window."

Somehow, I coaxed him away from the edge of the roof.

I grabbed his hand and led him onto the landing.  I was shaking.
Something seemed to have touched him, and an almost normal expression
replaced his usual blank indifference or the intense introspective
rolling of his eyes.  He carried me downstairs to a sofa and even
fetched a towel to wipe away my tears.  But the signs of normality were
short-lived.  Before I had recovered from the shock, I had to scramble
up and run because he raised his hand and was about to hit me.

Instead of allowing my father medical treatment, the Rebels found his
insanity a source of entertainment.  A poster serial appeared every
other day entitled "The Inside Story of Madman Chang."  Its authors,
from my father's department, ridiculed and lavished sarcasm on my
father.

The posters were pasted up in a prime site just outside the department,
and drew large, appreciative crowds.  I forced myself to read them,
although I was aware of the stares from other readers, many of whom
knew who I was.  I heard them whispering to those who did not know my
identity.  My heart would tremble with rage and unbearable pain for my
father, but I knew that reports of my reactions would reach my father's
persecutors.  I wanted to look calm, and to let them know that they
could not demoralize us.  I had no fear or sense of humiliation, only
contempt for them.

What had turned people into monsters?  What was the reason for all this
pointless brutality?  It was in this period that my devotion to Mao
began to wane.  Before when people had been persecuted I could not be
absolutely sure of their innocence; but I knew my parents.  Doubts
about Mao's infallibility crept into my mind, but at that stage, like
many people, I mainly blamed his wife and the Cultural Revolution
Authority.  Mao himself, the godlike Emperor, was still beyond
questioning.

We watched my father deteriorate mentally and physically with each
passing day.  My mother went to ask Chen Mo for help again.  He
promised to see what he could do.

We waited, but nothing happened: his silence meant he must have failed
to get the Tings to allow my father to have treatment.  In desperation,
my mother went to the Red Chengdu headquarters to see Yan and Yong.

The dominant group at Sichuan Medical College was part of Red Chengdu.
The college had a psychiatric hospital attached to it, and a word from
Red Chengdu headquarters could get my father in.  Yan and Yong were
very sympathetic, but they would have to convince their comrades.

Humanitarian considerations had been condemned by Mao as 'bourgeois
hypocrisy," and it went without saying that there should be no mercy
for 'class enemies."  Yan and Yong had to give a political reason for
treating my father.

They had a good one: he was being persecuted by the Tings.  He could
supply ammunition against them, perhaps even help to bring them down.
This, in turn, could bring about the collapse of z6 August.

There was another reason.  Mao had said the new Revolutionary
Committees must contain 'revolutionary officials'

as well as Rebels and members of the armed forces.  Both Red Chengdu
and 26 August were trying to find officials to represent them on the
Sichuan Revolutiona~ Commiuee.

Besides, the Rebels were beginning to find out how complex politics
was, and how daunting a task it was actually to run an administration.
They needed competent politicians as advisers.  Red Chengdu thought my
father was an ideal candidate, and sanctioned medical treatment.

Red Chengdu knew that my father had been denounced for saying
blasphemous things against Mao and the Cultural Revolution, and that
Mme.  Mao had condemned him.

But these claims had only been made by their enemies in wall posters,
where truth and lies were often mixed up.

They could, therefore, dismiss them.

My father was admitted to the mental hospital of Sichuan Medical
College.  It was in the suburbs of Chengdu, surrounded by rice fields.
Bamboo leaves swayed over the brick walls and the iron main gate.  A
second gate shut off a walled courtyard green with moss the residential
area for the doctors and nurses.  At the end of the courtyard, a flight
of red sandstone stairs led into the windowless side of a two-story
building flanked by solid, high walls.  The stairs were the only access
to the inside the psychiatric wards.

The two male nurses who came for my father were dressed in ordinary
clothes, and told him they were taking him to another denunciation
meeting.  When they reached the hospital my father straggled to get
away.  They dragged him upstairs into a small empty room, shutting the
door behind them so my mother and I would not have to see them putting
him into a straitjacket.  I was heartbroken to see him being so roughly
handled, but I knew it was for his own good.

The psychiatrist, Dr.  Su, was in his thirties, with a gentle face and
professional manner.  He told my mother he would spend a week observing
my father before he gave a diagnosis.  At the end of the week, he
reached his conclusion:

schizophrenia.  My father was given electric shocks and insulin
injections, for which he had to be tied tight onto the bed.  In a few
days, he began to recover his sanity.  With tears in his eyes, he
begged my mother to ask the doctor to change the treatment.

"It is so painful."  His voice broke.

"It feels worse than death."  But Dr.  Su said there was no other
way.

The next time I saw my father, he was sitting on his bed chatting to my
mother and Yan and Yong.  They were all smiling.  My father was even
laughing.  He looked well again.

I had to pretend to go to the toilet to wipe away my tears.

On the orders of Red Chengdu, my father received special food and a
full-time nurse~Yan and Yong visited him often, with members of his
department who were sympathetic to him and who had themselves been
subjected to denunciation meetings by Mrs.  Shau's group.  My father
liked Yan and Yong very much, and although he could be unobservant, he
realized they were in love, and teased them charmingly.  I could see
they enjoyed this greatly.  At last, I felt, the nightmare was over;
now that my father was well, we could face any disasters together.

The treatment lasted about forty days.  By mid-July he was back to
normal.  He was discharged, and he and my mother were taken to Chengdu
University, where they were given a suite in a small self contained
courtyard.

Student guards were placed on the gate.  My father was provided with a
pseudonym and told that he should not go out of the courtyard during
the day, for his safety.  My mother fetched their meals from a special
kitchen.  Yan and Yong came to see him every day, as did the Red
Chengdu leaders, who were all very courteous to him.

I visited my parents there often, riding a borrowed bicycle for an hour
on potholed country roads.  My father seemed peaceful.  He would say
over and over again how grateful he felt to these students for enabling
him to get treatment.

When it was dark, he was allowed out, and we went for
long, quiet strolls on the campus, followed at
a distance by a couple of guards.  We wandered along the lanes lined
with hedges of Cape jasmine.  The fist-sized white flowers gave off a
strong fragrance in the summer breeze.  It seemed like a dream of
serenity, so far away from the terror and violence.  I knew this was my
father's prison, but I wished he would never have to come out.

In the summer of 1967, factional fighting among the Rebels was
escalating into mini civil war all over China.

The antagonism between the Rebel factions was far greater than their
supposed anger toward the capitalist-roaders, because they were
fighting tooth and nail for power.  Kang Sheng, Mao's intelligence
chief, and Mme Mao led the Cultural Revolution Authority in stirring up
more animosity by calling the factional fighting 'an extension of the
struggle between the Communists and the Kuomintang' without specifying
which group was which.  The Cultural Revolution Authority ordered the
army to 'arm the Rebels for self-defense," without telling them which
factions to support.  Inevitably, different army units armed different
factions on the basis of their own preferences.

The armed forces were in great upheaval already, because Lin Biao was
busy trying to purge his opponents and replace them with his own men.
Eventually Mao realized that he could not afford instability in the
army, and reined in Lin Biao.  However, he appeared to be in two minds
about the factional fighting among the Rebels.  On the one hand, he
wanted the factions to unite so that his personal power structure could
be established.  On the other hand, he seemed incapable of repressing
his love of fighting: as bloody wars spread across China he said, "It
is not a bad thing to let the young have some practice in using arms we
haven't had a war for so long."

In Sichuan, the battles were especially fierce, partly because the
province was the center of China's arms industry.  Tanks, armored cars,
and artillery were taken from the production lines and warehouses by
both sides.  Another cause was the Tings, who set out to eliminate
their opponents.  In Yibin there was brutal fighting with guns, hand
grenades, mortars, and machine guns.  Over a hundred people died in the
city of Yibin alone.  In the end Red Chengdu was forced to abandon the
city.

Many went to the nearby city of Luzhou, which was held by Red Chengdu.
The Tings dispatched over 5,000 members of 26 August to attack the
city, and eventually seized it, killing nearly 300 and wounding many
more.

In Chengdu, the fighting was sporadic, and only the most fanatical
joined in.  Even so, I saw parades of tens of thousands of Rebels
carrying the blood-soaked corpses of people killed in bat ties and
people shooting rifles in the streets.

It was under these circumstances that Red Chengdu made three requests
of my father: to announce his support for them; to tell them about the
Tings; and to become an adviser and eventually represent them on the
Sichuan Revolution Committee.

He refused.  He said he could not back one group against another, nor
could he provide information against the Tings, as that might aggravate
the situation and create more animosity.  He also said he would not
represent a faction on the Sichuan Revolutionary Committee indeed, he
had no desire to be on it at all.

Eventually, the friendly atmosphere turned ugly.  The chiefs of Red
Chengdu were split.  One group said they had never encountered anyone
so incredibly obstinate and perverse.  My father had been persecuted to
the brink of death, yet he refused to let other people avenge him.  He
dared to oppose the powerful Rebels who had saved his life.  He turned
down an offer to be rehabilitated and return to power.  In anger and
exasperation, some shouted: "Let's give him a good beating.  We should
at least break a couple of his bones to teach him a lesson!"

But an and Yong spoke up for him, as did a few others.

?

"It is rare to see a character like him," said Yong.

"It is not right to punish him.  He would not bend even if he were
beaten to death.  And to torture him is to bring shame on us all.  Here
is a man of principle!"

Despite the threat of beating, and his gratitude to these Rebels, my
father would not go against his principles.  One night at the end of
September 1967 a car brought him and my mother home.  Yan and Yong
could no longer protect him.  They accompanied my parents home, and
said goodbye.

My parents immediately fell into the hands of the Tings and Mrs. Shau's
group.  The Tings made it clear that the attitude staff members took
toward my father would determine their future.  Mrs.  Shau was promised
the equivalent of my father's job in the forthcoming Sichuan
Revolutionary Committee, provided my father was 'thoroughly smashed."
Those who showed sympathy to my father were themselves condemned.

One day two men from Mrs.  Shau's group came to our apatunent to take
my father away to a 'meeting."  Later they returned and told me and my
brothers to go to his depa~i,nent to bring him back.

My father was leaning against a wall in the courtyard of the
department, in a position which showed that he had been trying to stand
up.  His face was black and blue, and unbelievably swollen.  His head
had been half shaved, clearly in a very rough manner.

There had been no denunciation meeting.  When he arrived at the office,
he was immediately yanked into a small room, where half a dozen large
strangers set upon him.  They punched and kicked the lower part of his
body, especially his genitals.  They forced water down his mouth and
nose and then stamped on his stomach.  Water, blood, and excreta were
pressed out.  My father fainted.

When he came to, the thugs had disappeared.  My father felt terribly
thirsty.  He dragged himself out of the room, and scooped some water
from a puddle in the courtyard.

He tried to stand up, but was unable to stay on his feet.

Members of Mrs.  Shau's group were in the courtyard, but no one lifted
a finger to help him.

The thugs came from the 26 August faction in Chongqing, about x5o miles
from Chengdu.  There had been large-scale battles there, with heavy
artillery lobbing shells across the Yangtze.  26 August was driven out
of the city, and many members fled to Chengdu, where some were
accommodated in our compound.  They were restless and frustrated, and
told Mrs.  Shau's group that their fists 'itched to put an end to their
vegetarian life and to taste some blood and meat."  My father was
offered up to them.

That night, my father, who had never once moaned after his previous
beatings, cried out in agony.  The next morning, my fourteen-year-old
brother Jin-ming raced to the compound kitchen as soon as it was open
to borrow a cart to take him to the hospital.  Xiao-her, then thirteen,
went out and bought a hair clipper, and cut the remaining hair from my
father's half-shaved head.  When he saw his bald head in the mirror, my
father gave a wry smile.

"This is good.  I won't have to worry about my hair being pulled next
time I'm at a denunciation meeting."

We put my father on the cart and pulled him to a nearby orthopedic
hospital.  This time we did not need authorization to get him looked
at, as his ailment had nothing to do with the mind.  Mental illness was
a very sensitive area.

Bones had no ideological color.  The doctor was very warm.

When I saw how carefully he touched my father, a lump rose in my
throat.  I had seen so much shoving, slapping, and hitting, and so
little gentleness.

The doctor said two of my father's ribs were broken.  But he could not
be hospitalized.  That needed authorization.

Besides, there were far too many severe injuries for the hospital to
accommodate.  It was crams ed with people who had been wounded in the
denunciation meetings and the factional fightng.  I saw a young man on
a stretcher with a jl third of his head gone.  His companion told us he
had been hit by a hand grenade.

My mother went to see Chen Mo again, and asked him to put in a word
with the Tings to stop my father's beatings.

A few days later Chen told my mother the Tings were prepared to
'forgive' my father if he would write a wall poster singing the praises
of 'good officials' Liu Jie-ting and Zhang Xi-ting.  He emphasized that
they had just been given renewed full, explicit backing by the Cultural
Revolution Authority, and Zhou Enlai had specifically stated that he
regarded the Tings as 'good officials."  To continue to oppose them,
Chen told my mother, was tantamount to 'throwing an egg against a
rock."  when my mother told my father, he said, "There's nothing good
to say about them."

"But," she implored him tearfully, 'this is not to get your job back,
or even for rehabilitation, it's for your life!  What is a poster
compared to a life?"

"I will not sell my soul," answered my father.

For over a year, until the end of 1968, my father was in and out of
detention, along with most of the former leading officials in the
provincial government.  Our apa~uHent was constantly raided and turned
upside down.  Detention was now called "Mao Zedong Thought Study
Courses."  The pressure in these 'courses' was such that many groveled
to the Tings; some committed suicide.  But my father never gave in to
the Tings' demands to work with them.  He would say later how much
having a loving family had helped him.  Most of those who committed
suicide did so after their families had disowned them.  We visited my
father in detention whenever we were allowed, which was seldom, and
surrounded him with affection whenever he was home for a fleeting
stay.

The Tings knew that my father loved my mother very much, and tried to
break him through her.  Intense pressure was put on her to denounce
him.  She had many reasons to resent my father.  He had not invited her
mother to their wedding.  He had let her walk hundreds of agonizing
miles,

and had not given her much sympathy in her crises.  In Yibin he had
refused to let her go to a better hospital for a dangerous birth.  He
had always given the Party and the revolution priority over her.  But
my mother had understood and respected my father and had above all
never ceased to love him.  She would particularly stand by him now that
he was in trouble.  No amount of suffering could bring her to denounce
him.

My mother's own department turned a deaf ear to the Tings' orders to
torment her, but Mrs.  Shau's group was happy to oblige, and so were
some other organizations which had nothing to do with her.  Altogether,
she had to go through about a hundred denunciation meetings.  Once she
was taken to a rally of tens of thousands of people in the People's
Park in the center of Chengdu to be denounced.  Most of the
participants had no idea who she was.  She was not nearly important
enough to merit such a mass event.

My mother was condemned for all sorts of things, not least for having a
warlord general as a father.  The fact that General Xue had died when
she was barely two made no difference.

In those days, every capitalist-roader had one or more teams
investigating his or her past in minute detail, because Mao wanted the
history of everyone working for him thoroughly checked.  At different
times my mother had four different teams investigating her, the last of
which contained about fifteen people.  They were sent to various parts
of China.  It was through these investigations that my mother came to
know the whereabouts of her old friends and relatives with whom she had
lost contact for years.

Most of the investigators just went sight-seeing and returned with
nothing incriminating, but one group came back with a 'scoop."

Back in Jinzhou in the late 194os, Dr.  Xia had let a room to the
Communist agent Yu-wn, who had been my mother's boss, in charge of
collecting military information and smuggling it out of the city.
Yu-wu's own controller, who was unknown to my mother then, had been
pretending to work for the Kuomintang.  During the Cultural Revolution,
he was put under intense pressure to confess to being a Kuomintang spy,
and was tortured atrociously.  In the end, he 'confessed," inventing a
spy ring which included Yu-wu.

Yu-wu was tortured ferociously as well.  In order to avoid
incriminating other people, he killed himself by slashing his wrists.
He did not mention my mother.  But the investigation team found out
about their connection and claimed that she was a member of the 'spy
ring."

Her teenage contact with the Kuomintang was dragged up.  All the
questions that had come up in 1955 were gone over again.  This time
they were not asked in order to get an answer.  My mother was simply
ordered to admit that she was a Kuomintang spy.  She argued that the
investigation in 1955 had cleared her, but she was told that the chief
investigator then, Mr.  Kuang, was a 'traitor and Kuomintang spy'
himself.

Mr.  Kuang had been imprisoned by the Kuomintang in his youth.  The
Kuomintang had promised to release underground Communists if they
signed a recantation for publication in the local newspaper.  At first
he and his comrades had refused, but the Party instructed them to
accept.  They were told the Party needed them, and did not mind
'anti-Communist statements' which were not sincere.  Mr.  Kuang
followed orders and was duly released.

Many others had done the same thing.  In one famous case in 1936,
sixty-one imprisoned Communists were released this way.  The order to
'recant' was given by the Party Central Committee and delivered by Liu
Shaoqi.

Some of these sixty-one subsequently became top officials in the
Communist government, including vice-premiers, ministers, and first
secretaries of provinces.  During the Cultural Revolution, Mme Mao and
Kang Sheng announced that they were 'sixty-one big traitors and
spies."

The verdict was endorsed by Mao personally, and these people were
subjected to the cruelest tortures.  Even people remotely connected
with them got into deadly trouble.

Following this precedent, hundreds of thousands of former underground
workers and their contacts, some of the bravest men and women who had
fought for a Communist China, were charged with being 'traitors and
spies' and suffered detention, brutal denunciation meetings, and
torture.  According to a later official account, in the province next
to Sichuan, Yunnan, over 14,000 people died.

In Hebei province, which surrounds Peking, 84,000 were detained and
tortured; thousands died.  My mother learned years later that her first
boyfriend, Cousin Hu, was among them.  She had thought he had been
executed by the Kuomintang, but his father had in fact bought him out
of prison with gold bars.  No one would ever tell my mother how he
died.

Mr.  Kuang fell under the same accusation.  Under torture, he attempted
suicide, unsuccessfully.  The fact that he had cleared my mother in
1956 was alleged to prove her 'guilt."  She was kept in various forms
of detention on and off for nearly two years from late 1967 to October
1969.  Her conditions depended largely on her guards.

Some were kind to her when they were alone.  One of them, the wife of
an army officer, got medicine for her hemorrhage.  She also asked her
husband, who had access to privileged food supplies, to bring my mother
milk, eggs, and chicken every week.

Thanks to kindhearted guards like her, my mother was allowed home
several times for a few days.  The Tings learned of this, and the kind
guards were replaced by a sour4 aced woman whom my mother did not know,
who tormented and tortured her for pleasure.  When the fancy took her,
she would make my mother stand bent over in the courtyard for hours. In
the winter, she would make her kneel in cold water until she passed
out.  Twice she put my mother on what was called a 'tiger bench."  My
mother had

?

343' Father.4rrested 479 to sit on a narrow bench with her legs
stretched out in front of her.  Her torso was tied to a pillar and her
thighs to the bench so she could not move or bend her legs.  Then
bricks were forced under her heels.  The intention was to break the
knees or the hipbones.  Twenty years before, in Jinzhou, she had been
threatened with this in the Kuomintang torture chamber.  The 'tiger
bench' had to stop because the guard needed men to help her push in the
bricks; they helped reluctantly a couple of times, but then refused to
have any more to do with it.  Years later the woman was diagnosed as a
psychopath, and today is in a psychiatric hospital.

My mother signed many 'confessions," admitting that she had sympathized
with a 'capitalist road."  But she refused to denounce my father, and
she denied all 'spy' charges, which she knew would inevitably lead to
the incrimination of others.

During her detention we were often not allowed to see her, and even had
no idea where she was.  I would wander the streets outside the possible
place in the hope of catching sight of her.

There was a period when she was detained in a deserted cinema on the
main shopping street.  There we were occasionally permitted to deliver
a parcel for her to a warden, or to see her for a few minutes, although
never on her own.  When a fierce guard was on duty, we had to sit under
freezing eyes.  One day in autumn 1968 I went there to deliver a food
parcel and was told it could not be accepted.  No reason was given, and
I was told not to send things anymore.  When my grandmother heard the
news she passed out.  She thought my mother must be dead.

It was unbearable not knowing what had happened to my mother.  I took
my six-year-old brother Xiao-fang by the hand and went to the cinema.
We walked up and down the street in front of the gate.  We searched the
rows of windows on the second floor.  In desperation we screamed
"Mother!  Mother!"  at the top of our voices again and again.

Passersby stared at us, but I took no notice.  I just wanted to see
her.  My brother cried.  But my mother did not appear.

Years later, she told me that she had heard us.  In fact, her
psychopath guard had opened the window slightly so our voices would be
louder.  My mother was told that if she agreed to denounce my father,
and to confess to being a Kuomintang spy, she could see us
immediately.

"Otherwise," said the guard, 'you may never get out of this building
alive."  My mother said no.  All the time, she dug her nails into her
palms to stop her tears from falling.

21.  "Giving Charcoal in Snow'~ My Siblings and My Friends
(1967-1968)

Throughout 1967 and 1968, while Mao struggled to set up his personal
power system, he kept his victims, like my parents, in a state of
uncertainty and suffering.

Human anguish did not concern Mao.  People existed only to help him
realize his strategic plans.  But his purpose was not genocide, and my
family, like many other victims, were not deliberately starved.  My
parents still received their salaries every month in spite of the fact
that not only were they doing no work, they were also being denounced
and tormented.  The main compound canteen was working normally to
enable the Rebels to carry on with their 'revolution," and we, like the
families of other capitalist-roaders, were fed.  We also got the same
rations from the state as everyone else in the cities.

Much of the urban population was kept 'on hold' for the revolution. Mao
wanted the population to fight, but to live.

He protected the extremely capable premier, Zhou Enlai, so that he
could keep the economy going.  He knew he needed another first-class
administrator in reserve in case anything happened to Zhou, so he kept
Deng Xiaoping in relative security.  The country was not allowed to
collapse totally.

But, as the revolution dragged on, large parts of the economy slipped
into paralysis.  The urban population increased by several tens of
millions, but virtually no new housing or other service facilities were
built in the towns.

Nearly everything, from salt, toothpaste, and toilet paper to every
kind of food and clothing, either was rationed or disappeared
completely.  In Chengdu there was no sugar for a year, and six months
passed without a single bar of soap.

Starting from June 1966, there was no schooling.  The teachers either
had been denounced or were organizing their own Rebel groups.  No
school meant no control.  But what could we do with our freedom?  There
were virtually no books, no music, no films, no theater, no museums, no
teahouses, almost no way of keeping oneself occupied except cards,
which, though not officially sanctioned, made a stealthy comeback.
Unlike most revolutions, in Mao's there was nothing to do.  Naturally,
"Red Guardship' became many youngsters' full-time occupation.  The only
ways they could release their energy and frustration were in violent
denunciations and in physical and verbal bat ties with each other.

Joining the Red Guards was not compulsory.  With the disintegration of
the Party system, control over individuals loosened, and most of the
population was left alone.  Many people just stayed idle at home, and
one result was an explosion of petty fights.  Surliness replaced the
good service and polite behavior of the pre-Cultural Revolution days.
It became extremely common to see people quarreling on the streets with
shop assistants, with bus conductors, with passersby.  Another result
was that, since no one was looking after birth control, there was a
baby boom.

The population increased during the Cultural Revolution by two hundred
million.

By the end of 1966 my teenage siblings and I had decided that we had
had enough of being Red Guards.

Children in condemned families were supposed to 'draw a line' between
themselves and their parents, and many did so.  One of President Liu
Shaoqi's daughters wrote wall posters 'exposing' her father.  I knew
children who changed their surnames to demonstrate that they were
disowning their fathers, others who never visited their parents in
detention, and some who even took part in denunciation meetings against
their parents.

Once, when my mother was under tremendous pressure to divorce my
father, she asked us what we thought.  Standing by him meant we could
become 'blacks'; we had all seen the discrimination and torment such
people suffered.

But we said we would stick by him, come what may.  My mother said she
was pleased and proud of us.  Our devotion to our parents was increased
by our empathy for their suffering, our admiration for their integrity
and courage, and our loathing for their tormentors.  We came to feel a
new degree of respect, and love, for our parents.

We grew up fast.  We had no rival ties no squabbles, and no resentment
of each other, none of the usual problems or pleasures of teenagers.
The Cultural Revolution destroyed normal adolescence, with all its
pitfalls, and threw us straight into sensible adulthood in our early
teens.

At the age of fourteen, my love for my parents had an intensity that
could not have existed under normal circumstances.  My life revolved
entirely around them.  Whenever they were briefly at home, I would
watch their moods, trying to provide amusing company.  When they were
in detention, I would repeatedly go to the disdainful-looking Rebels
and demand a visit.  Sometimes I would be allowed a few minutes to sit
and talk with one of my parents, in the company of a guard.  I would
tell them how much I loved them.  I became well known among the former
staff of the Sichuan government and the Eastern District of Chengdu,
and an irritation to my parents' tormentors, who also hated me for
refusing to show fear of them.  Once Mrs.  Shau screamed that I 'looked
straight through' her.  Their fury led them to invent the accusation,
printed on one of their wall posters, that Red Chengdu had given my
father treatment because I had used my body to seduce Yong.

Apart from being with my parents, I spent most of my abundant free time
with friends.  After I came back from Peking in December 1966, I went
for a month to an airplane maintenance factory on the outskirts of
Chengdu with Plumpie and Ching-ching, a friend of hers.  We needed
something to occupy ourselves, and the most important thing we could
do, according to Mao, was to go to factories to stir up rebellious
actions against capitalistroaders.  Upheaval was invading industry too
slowly for Mao's liking.

The only action the three of us stirred up was the attention of some
young men from the now defunct factory basketball team.  We spent a lot
of time strolling on the country roads together, enjoying the rich
evening scent of the early bean blossoms.  But soon, as my parents'
suffering worsened, I went home, leaving Mao's orders and my
participation in the Cultural Revolution behind once and for all.

My friendship with Plumpie, Ching-ching, and the basketball players
lasted.  Also in our circle were my sister Xiao-hong and several other
girls from my school.  They were all older than I. We would meet
frequently in the home of one or another of us, and linger there for
the whole day, and often the night as well, having nothing else to
do.

We had endless discussions about which of the basketball players
fancied whom.  The captain of the team, a handsome nineteen-year-old
called Sai, was the center of speculation.  The girls wondered whether
he liked me or Ching-ching more.  He was reticent and reserved, and
Ching-ching was very keen on him.  Every time we were going to see him,
she would meticulously wash and comb her shoulder-length hair,
carefully iron and adjust her clothes to look stylish, and even put on
a lit He powder and rouge and pencil her eyebrows.  We all teased her
gently

I was also drawn to Sai.  I could feel my heart pound whenever I
thought of him, and would wake up at night seeing his face and feeling
feverishly hot.  I often murmured his name and talked to him in my mind
whenever I felt fear or worry.  But I never revealed anything to him,
or to my friends, or even to myself explicitly.  I only timidly
fantasized about him.  My parents dominated my life and my conscious
thoughts.  Any indulgence in my own affairs was immediately suppressed
as being disloyal.  The Cultural Revolution had deprived me of, or
spared me, a normal girlhood with tantrums, bickerings, and
boyfriends.

But I was not without vanity.  I sewed big blue wax-dyed,
abstract-patterned patches on the knees and seat of my trousers, which
had faded to pale gray.  My friends would laugh at the sight of them.
My grandmother was scandalized, and complained, "No other girls dress
like you."

But I insisted.  I was not trying to make myself look beautiful, just
different.

One day one of my friends told us that her parents, both distinguished
actors, had just committed suicide, unable to stand the denunciations.
Not long after, news came that the brother of another gift had killed
himself.  He had been a student at the Peking Aeronautical College, and
he and some fellow students had been denounced for trying to organize
an anti-Mao party.  He threw himself out of a third-floor window when
the police came to arrest him.

Some of his fellow 'conspirators' were executed; others were given life
sentences, the normal punishment for anyone attempting to organize an
opposition, which was rare.

Tragedies like this were part of our everyday life.

The families of Plumpie, Ching-ching, and some others were nor hit. And
they remained my friends.  They were not harassed by my parents'
persecutors, who could not extend their power to that degree.  But they
still ran risks by not swimming with the tide.  My friends were among
the millions who held sacred the traditional Chinese code of loyalty
'giving charcoal in snow."  The fact that they were there helped me
through the worst years of the Cultural Revolution.

They gave me a lot of practical help, too.  Toward the end of 1967 Red
Chengdu began to attack our compound, which was controlled by 26
August, and our block was turned into a fortress.  We were ordered to
move from our third-floor aparisuent into some ground-floor rooms in
the next block.

My parents were in detention at the time.  My father's department,
which would normally have looked after the move, now only gave us our
marching orders.  As there were no furniture-removal companies, without
the help of our friends my family would have ended up without a bed.

Still, we moved only the most essential furniture, leaving things like
my father's heavy bookcases behind; we could not lift them, let alone
can them down several flights of stairs.

Our new quarters were in an apasis~lent already occupied by the family
of another capitalist-roader, who were now ordered to vacate half of
it.  Apaximents were being reorganized like this all over the compound
so the top floors could be used as command posts.  My sister and I
shared a room.  We kept the window facing the now deserted back garden
permanently shut, because the moment it was opened, a strong stench
would flood in from the blocked drains outside.  At night, we heard
cries for surrender from outside the compound wall, and sporadic
shooting.  One night I was awakened by the sound of shattering glass: a
bullet had come through the window and embedded itself in the wall
opposite.  Strangely, I was not frightened.  After the horrors I had
been through, bullets had lost their effect.

To occupy myself, I began writing poetry in classical styles.  The
first poem with which I felt satisfied was written on my sixteenth
birthday, z5 March 1968.  There was no birthday celebration.  Both my
parents were in detention That night, as I lay in bed listening to the
gunshots and the Rebels' loudspeakers blaring out bloodcurdling
diatribes, I reached a turning point.  I had always been told, and had
believed, that I was living in a paradise on earth, socialist China,
whereas the capitalist world was hell.  Now I asked myself."  If this
is paradise, what then is hell?  I decided that I would like to see for
myself whether there was indeed a place more full of pain.  For the
first time, I consciously hated the regime I lived under, and craved an
alternative.

Still, I subconsciously avoided Mao.  He had been part of my life ever
since I was a child.  He was the idol, the god, the inspiration.  The
purpose of my life had been formulated in his name.  A couple of years
before, I would happily have died for him.  Although his magic power
had vanished from inside me, he was still sacred and un doubtable  Even
now, I did not challenge him.

It was in this mood that I composed my poem.  I wrote about the death
of my indoctrinated and innocent past as dead leaves being swept from a
tree by the whirlwind and carried to a world of no return.  I described
my bewilderment at the new world, at not knowing what and how to think.
It was a poem of groping in the dark, searching.

I wrote the poem down, and was lying in bed going over it in my head
when I heard banging on the door.  From the sound, I knew it was a
house raid.  Mrs.  Shau's Rebels had raided our apa,iment several
times.  They had taken away 'bourgeois luxury items' like my
grandmother's elegant clothes from the pre-Communist days, my mother's
fur lined Manchurian coat, and my father's suits- even though they were
Mao-style.  They even confiscated my woolen trousers.  They kept coming
back to try to find 'evidence' against my father.  I had grown used to
our quarters being turned upside down.

I was seized with anxiety about what would happen if they saw my poem.
When my father first came under attack he asked my mother to burn his
poems; he knew how writing, any writing, could be twisted against its
author.

But my mother could not bring herself to destroy them all.

She kept a few which he had written for her.  These cost him several
brutal denunciation meetings.

In one poem my father poked fun at himself for failing to climb to the
top of a scenic mountain.  Mrs.  Shau and her comrades accused him of
'lamenting his frustrated ambition to usurp China's supreme
leadership."

In another, he described working at night:

The light shines whiter when the night grows darker,

My pen races to meet the dawn... The Rebels claimed he was referring to
socialist China as 'dark night," and that he was working with his pen
to welcome a 'white dawn' - a Kuomintang comeback (white was the color
of counterrevolution).  In those days it was commonplace for such
ridiculous interpretations to be forced upon someone's writings.  Mao,
who was a lover of classical poetry, did not think of making it an
exception to this ghastly rule.  Writing poetry became a highly
dangerous occupation.

When the pounding on the door began, I quickly ran to the toilet, and
locked the door while my grandmother answered Mrs.  Shau and her posse.
My hands trembling, I managed to tear the poem into tiny pieces, throw
them into the bowl, and flush the toilet.  I searched the floor
carefully to make sure no pieces had fallen out.  But the paper did not
all disappear the first time.  I had to wait and flush again.  By now
the Rebels were banging on the door of the toilet, curtly ordering me
to come out immediately.

I did not answer.

My brother Jin-ming also got a fright that night.  Ever since the
Cultural Revolution had started, he had been frequenting a black market
specializing in books.  The commercial instinct of the Chinese is so
strong that black markets, Mao's greatest capitalist Mte noire, existed
right through the crushing pressure of the Cultural Revolution.

In the center of Chengdu, in the middle of the main shopping street,
was a bronze statue of Sun Yat-sen, who had led the 19x i republican
revolution which had overthrown 2,000 years of imperial rule.  The
statue had been erected before the Communists came to power.  Mao was
not particularly keen on any revolutionary leaders before himself,
including Sun.  But it was politic to lay claim to his tradition, so
the statue was allowed to stay, and the patch of ground around it
became a plant nursery.  When the Cultural Revolution broke out, Red
Guards attacked emblems of Sun Yat-sen until Zhou Enlai slapped a
protection order on them.  The statue survived, but the plant nursery
was abandoned as 'bourgeois decadence."  When Red Guards began raiding
people's houses and burning their books, a small crowd started to
gather on this deserted ground to deal in the volumes which had escaped
the bonfires.  All manner of people were to be found there: Red Guards
who wanted to make some cash from the books they had confiscated;
frustrated entrepreneurs who smelled money; scholars who did not want
their books to be burned but were afraid of keeping them; and book
lovers.  The books being traded had all been published or sanctioned
under the Communist regime before the Cultural Revolution.  Apart from
Chinese classics, they included Shakespeare, Dickens, Byron, Shelley,
Shaw, Thackeray, Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Turgenev, Chekhov, Ibsen,
Balzac, Maupassant, Flaubert, Dumas, Zola, and many other world
classics.  Even Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, who had been a great
favorite in China.

The price of the books depended on a variety of factors.

If they had a library stamp in them, most people shunned them.  The
Communist government had such a reputation for control and order that
people did not want to risk being caught with illegally gotten state
property, for which they would be severely punished.  They were much
happier buy 49o "Giving Charcoal in Snowing privately owned books with
no identification marks.

Novels with erotic passages commanded the highest prices, and also
carried the greatest danger.  Stendhars Le Rouge et le Noir, considered
erotic, cost the equivalent of two weeks' wages for an average
person.

Jin-ming went to this black market every day.  His initial capital came
from books which he had obtained from a paper recycling shop, to which
frightened citizens were selling their collections as scrap paper.
Jin-ming had chatted up a shop assistant and bought a lot of these
books, which he resold at much higher prices.  He then bought more
books at the black market, read them, sold them, and bought more.

Between the start of the Cultural Revolution and the end of 1968, at
least a thousand books passed through his hands.  He read at the rate
of one or two a day.  He only dared to keep a dozen or so at any one
time, and had to hide them carefully.  One of his hiding places was
under an abandoned water tower in the compound, until a downpour
destroyed a stock of his favorites, including Jack London's The Call of
the Wild.  He kept a few at home stashed in the mattresses and the
corners of our storeroom.  On the night of the house raid he had Le
Rouge et le Noir hidden in his bed.  But, as always, he had torn the
cover off and replaced it with that of The Selected Works of Mao
Zedong, and Mrs.  Shau and her comrades did not examine it.

Jin-ming dealt in other black-market goods as well.  His enthusiasm for
science had not waned.  At the time, the only black market dealing in
scientific goods in Chengdu traded in semi-conductor radio parts: this
branch of industry was in favor because it 'spread Chairman Mao's
words."

Jin-ming bought parts and made his own radios, which he sold at good
prices.  He bought more parts for his real purpose: testing various
theories in physics which had been nagging him.

To get money for his experiments, he even dealt in Mao badges.  Many
factories had stopped normal production

to produce aluminum badges with Mao's head on them.

Collecting of any kind, including stamps and paintings, had been banned
as a 'bourgeois habit."  So people's instinct for collecting turned to
this sanctioned object although they could only deal in it
clandestinely.  Jin-ming made a small fortune.  Litfie did the Great
Helmsman know that even the image of his head had become a piece of
property for capitalist speculation, the very activity he had tried so
hard to stamp out.

There were repeated clamp downs  Often truckloads of Rebels would
arrive, seal off the streets, and grab anyone who looked suspicious.
Sometimes they sent spies who pretended to be browsing.  Then a whistle
would blow and they would swoop on the dealers.  Those who were caught
had their belongings confiscated.  They were usually beaten.  One
regular punishment was 'bloodletting' stabbing them in the buttocks.
Some were tortured, and all were threatened with double punishment if
they did not stop.  But most came back, again and again.

My second brother, Xiao-her, was twelve at the beginning of 1967.
Having nothing to do, he soon found himself involved in a street gang.
Virtually nonexistent before the Cultural Revolution, these were now
flourishing.  A gang was called a 'dock," and its leader the
'helmsman."  Everyone else was a 'brother," and had a nickname, usually
with some connection with animals: "Thin Dog' if a boy was thin; "Gray
Wolf' if he had a lock of gray hair.  Xiao-her was called "Black Hoof'
because part of his name, her, means 'black," and also because he was
dark, and was swift at running errands, which was one of his duties, as
he was younger than most of the gang members.

At first the gangsters treated him as a revered guest, because they had
rarely known any high officials' children.

Gang members tended to come from poor families, and had often been
school dropouts before the Cultural Revolution.  Their families were
not targets of the revolution, and they were not interested in it,
either.

Some boys sought to imitate the ways of the high officials' children,
disregarding the fact that the high officials had been toppled.  In
their Red Guard days, the high officials' children favored old
Communist army uniforms, as they were the only people who had access to
these through their parents.  Some street boys got the old gear through
black-market trading, or dyed their clothes green.  But they lacked the
haughty air of the elite, and their green was often not quite the right
shade.  They were sneered at by high officials' children, as well as by
their own friends, as 'pseuds."

Later the high officials' children switched to wearing dark-blue
jackets and trousers.  Although most of the population was wearing blue
at the time, theirs was a particular shade, and it was also unusual to
wear the same color top and bottom.  After they had made this their
distinguishing sign, boys and girls from other backgrounds had to avoid
it, if they did not want to be treated as pseuds.  The same went for a
certain kind of shoes: black cord uppers with white plastic soles and a
white plastic band showing in between.

Some gang members invented their own style.  They wore many layers of
shirts under an outer garment, and turned out all their collars.  The
more collars you named out, the smarter you were considered to be.
Often Xiao-her wore six or seven shirts under his jacket and two even
in the boiling summer heat.  Jogging pants always had to show under
their shortened trousers.  They also wore white sneakers without laces,
and sported army caps, with cardboard strips tucked inside to make the
peaks stick up so they looked imposing.

One of the main ways in which Xiao-her's 'brothers' occupied their
empty days was stealing.  Whatever they got, their haul had to be
handed over to the helmsman to be divided up evenly among them.
Xiao-her was too afraid to steal anything, but his brothers gave him
his share without demur.

Theft was extremely widespread during the Cultural Revolution,
particularly pick pocketing and stealing bicycles.  Most people I knew
had their pockets picked at least once.  For me, shopping trips often
involved either losing my own purse or seeing someone yelling because
their purse had been stolen.  The police, who had split into factions,
exercised only token surveillance.

When foreigners first came to China in large numbers in the 197os, many
were impressed by the 'moral cleanliness' of the society: a discarded
sock would follow its owner a thousand miles from Peking to Guangzhou,
cleaned and folded and placed in his hotel room.  The visitors did not
realize that only foreigners and Chinese under close surveillance
received such attention, or that no one would dare to steal from
foreigners, because taking even a handkerchief was likely to be
punished by death.  The clean folded sock bore no relation to the real
state of society: it was just part of the regime's theater.

Xiao-her's brothers were also obsessed with chasing gifts.  The twelve-
and thirteen-year-olds like Xiao-her were often too shy to go after
gifts themselves, so they became the older boys' messengers, delivering
their error fiddled love letters.  Xiao-her would knock on a door,
praying that it would be opened by the girl herself and not her father
or brother, who was sure to slap him across the head.  Sometimes, when
fear got the upper hand, he would slip the letter under the door.

When a girl rejected a proposal, Xiao-her and other younger boys became
the tool of revenge of the spurned lover, making noises outside her
house and firing catapults at her window.  When the girl came out, they
spat at her, swore at her, shook their middle fingers at her, and
yelled dirty words which they did not fully understand.  Abusive
Chinese terms for women are rather graphic: 'shuffle' (for the shape of
her genitals), 'horse saddle' (for the image of being mounted), over
spilling oil lamp' ('too frequent' discharge), and 'worn-out shoes'
(much 'used').

Some girls tried to find protectors in the gangs, and the more capable
ones became helms women themselves.  The girls who became involved in
this male world sported their own picturesque sobriquets, like "Dewy
Black Peony," "Broken Wine Vessel,"

"Snake Enchantress."

The third major occupation of the gangs was fighting, at the slightest
provocation.  Xiao-her was very excited by the fights, but much to his
regret, he was endowed with what he called 'a cowardly disposition." He
would run away at the first sign that a battle was turning ugly. Thanks
to his lack of bravado, he survived intact while many boys were
injured, even killed, in these pointless exchanges.

One afternoon, he and some of his brothers were loitering about as
usual when a member of the gang rushed over and said the home of a
brother had just been raided by another dock, and this brother had been
subjected to a 'bloodletting."  They went back to their own 'dockyard'
to collect their weapons sticks, bricks, knives, wire whips, and
cudgels.  Xiao-her tucked a three-section cudgel into his leather belt.
They ran to the house where the incident had occurred, but found that
their enemies had gone and their wounded brother had been taken to a
hospital by his family.  Xiao-her's helmsman wrote a letter, peppered
with errors, throwing down the gauntlet to the other gang, and Xiao-her
was charged with delivering it.

The letter demanded a formal fight in the People's Sports Stadium,
where there was plenty of space.  The stadium no longer hosted any kind
of sport now, competitive games having been condemned by Mao.  Athletes
had to devote themselves to the Cultural Revolution.

On the appointed day, Xiao-her's gang of several dozen boys waited on
the running track.  Two slow hours passed, then a man in his early
twenties limped into the stadium.

It was "Lame Man' Tang, a famous figure in the Chengdu underworld.  In
spite of his relative youth, he was treated with the respect normally
reserved for the old.

Lame Man Tang had become lame from polio.  His

father had been a Kuomintang official, and so the son was allocated an
undesirable job in a small workshop located in his old family house,
which the Communists had confiscated.  Employees in small units like
this did not enjoy the benefits available to workers in big factories,
such as guaranteed employment, free health services, and a pension.

His background had prevented Tang from going on to higher education,
but he was extremely bright, and became the defaao chief of the Chengdu
underworld.  Now he had come at the request of the other dock, to ask
for a truce.

He produced several cartons of the best cigarettes and handed them
around.  He delivered apologies from the other dock, and their promise
to foot the bills for the damaged house and the medical care.
Xiao-her's helmsman accepted: it was impossible to say no to Lame Man
Tang.

Lame Man Tang was soon arrested.  By the beginning of 1968, a new,
fourth stage of the Cultural Revolution had started.  Phase One had
been the teenage Red Guards;

then came the Rebels and the attacks on capitalist-roaders;

the third phase had been the factional wars among the Rebels.  Mao now
decided to halt the factional fighting.  To bring about obedience, he
spread terror to show that no one was immune.  A sizable part of the
hitherto unaffected population, including some Rebels, now became
victims.

New political campaigns were cranked up one after another to consume
new class enemies.  The largest of these witch hunts "Clean Up the
Class Ranks," claimed Lame Man Tang.  He was released after the end of
the Cultural Revolution in 1976, and in the early 1980s he became an
entrepreneur and a millionaire, one of the richest men in Chengdu.  His
dilapidated family house was returned to him.  He tore it down and
built a grand two-story edifice.

When the craze for discos hit China he was often to be seen sitting in
the most prominent spot, benignly watching the young boys and girls of
his entourage dancing while he slowly counted out a thick wad of bank
notes with emphatic, deliberate nonchalance, paying for the whole crowd
and reveling in his newfound power money.

The "Clean Up the Class Ranks' campaign ruined the lives of millions.
In one single case, the so-called Inner Mongolia People's Party affair,
some ten percent of the adult Mongolian population were subjected to
torture or physical maltreatment; at least twenty thousand died.  This
particular campaign was modeled on pilot studies of six factories and
two universities in Peking, which were under Mao's personal
supervision.  In a report on one of the six factories, the Xinhua
Printing Unit, there was a passage which read: "After this woman was
labeled a counterrevolutionary, one day when she was doing forced labor
and the guard turned his eyes away, she rushed up to the fourth floor
of the women's dormitory, jumped out of a window, and killed herself.
Of course, it is inevitable that counterrevolution ari should kill
themselves.  But it is a pity that we now have one less "negative
example."  Mao wrote on this report: "This is the best written of all
the similar reports I have read."

This and other campaigns were managed by the Revolutionary Committees
which were being set up all over the country.  The Sichuan Provincial
Revolutionary Committee was established on 1 June 1968.  Its leaders
were the same four people who had headed the Preparatory Committee the
two army chiefs and the Tings.  The committee included the chiefs of
the two major Rebel camps, Red Chengdu and 26 August, and some
'revolutionary officials."

This consolidation of Mao's new power system had profound effects on my
family.  One of the first results was a decision to withhold part of
the salaries of the capitalistroaders and only to leave each dependent
a small monthly cash allowance.  Our family income was cut by more than
half.  Although we were not starving, we could no longer afford to buy
from the black market, and the state supply of food was deteriorating
fast.  The meat ration, for instance, was half a pound per person per
month.  My grandmother worried and planned day and night to enable us
children to eat better, and to produce food parcels for our parents in
detention.

The next decision of the Revolutionary Committee was to order all the
capitalist-roaders out of the compound to make room for the new
leaders.  My family was assigned some rooms at the top of a three-story
house which had been the office of a now defunct magazine.  There was
no running water or toilet on the top floor.  We had to go downstairs
even to brush our teeth, or to pour away a cup of leftover tea.  But I
did not mind, because the house was so elegant, and I was thirsty for
beautiful things.

Unlike our apartment in the compound, which was in a featureless cement
block, our new residence was a splendid brick-and-timber double-fronted
mansion with exquisitely framed reddish-brown colored windows under
gracefully curving eaves.  The back garden was dense with mulberry
trees, and the front garden had a thick vine trellis, a grove of
oleander, a paper mulberry, and a huge nameless tree whose pepper like
fruit grew in little clusters inside the folds of its boat-shaped brown
and crispy leaves.  I particularly loved the ornamental bananas and
their long arc of leaves, an unusual sight in a nontropical climate.

In those days, beauty was so despised that my family was sent to this
lovely house as a punishment.  The main room was big and rectangular,
with a parquet floor.  Three sides were glass, which made it
brilliantly light and on a clear day offered a panoramic view of the
distant snowy mountains of west Sichuan.  The balcony was not made of
the usual cement, but of wood painted a reddish brown color, with
"Greek key' patterned railings.  Another room which opened onto the
balcony had an unusually high, pointed ceiling about twenty feet in
height with exposed, faded scarlet beams.  I fell in love with our new
residence at once.

Later I realized that in winter the rectangular room was a battlefield
of bitter winds from all directions through the thin glass, and dust
fell like rain from the high ceiling when the wind blew.  Still, on a
calm night, lying in bed with the moonlight filtering through the
windows, and the shadow of the tall paper mulberry tree dancing on the
wall, I was filled with joy.  I was so relieved to be out of the
compound and all its dirty politics that I hoped my family would never
go near it again.

I loved our new street as well.  It was called Meteorite Street,
because hundreds of years before a meteorite had fallen there.  The
street was paved with crushed cobblestones, which I much preferred to
the asphalt surface of the street outside the compound.

The only thing that reminded me of the compound was some of our
neighbors, who worked in my father's department and belonged to Mrs.
Shau's Rebels.  When they looked at us it was with expressions of
steely rigidity, and on the rare, unavoidable occasions when we had to
communicate, they spoke to us in barks.  One of them had been the
editor of the closed-down magazine, and his wife had been a
schoolteacher.  They had a boy of six called Jo-jo, the same age as my
brother Xiao-fang.  A minor government official, with a five-year-old
daughter, came to stay with them, and the three children often played
together in the garden.  My grandmother was anxious about Xiao-fang
playing with them, but she dared not forbid him our neighbors might
interpret this as hostility toward Chairman Mao's Rebels.

At the foot of the wine-red spiral staircase which led to our rooms was
a big half-moon-shaped table.  In the old days, a huge porcelain vase
would have been placed on it with a bouquet of winter jasmine or peach
blossom.  Now it was bare, and the three children often played on it.

One day, they were playing 'doctor': Jo-jo was the doctor, Xiao-fang a
nurse, and the five-year-old girl the patient.

She lay on her stomach on the table and pulled her skirt up for an
injection.  Xiao-fang held a piece of wood from the back of a broken
chair as his 'needle."  At this moment, the girl's mother came up the
sandstone steps onto the landing.  She screamed and snatched her
daughter off the table.

She found a few scratches on the child's inner thigh.

Instead of taking her to a hospital, she fetched some Rebels from my
father's office a couple of streets away.  A crowd soon marched into
the front garden.  My mother, who happened to be home for a few days
from detention, was immediately seized.  Xiao-fang was grabbed and
yelled at by the adults.  They told him they would 'beat him to death'
if he refused to say who had taught him to 'rape the girl."

They tried to force him to say it was his elder brothers.

Xiao-fang was unable to say a word, even to cry.  Jo-jo looked badly
scared.  He cried and said it was he who had asked Xiao-fang to give
the injection.  The little girl cried, too, saying she had not had her
injection.  But the adults shouted at them to shut up, and continued to
hector Xiaofang.  Eventually, at my mother's suggestion, the crowd,
jostling my mother and dragging Xiao-fang, stormed off to the Sichuan
People's Hospital.

As soon as they entered the outpatients' department, the angry mother
of the girl and the dramatically heated crowd started to make
accusations to the doctors, nurses, and the other patients: "The son of
a capitalist-roader has raped the daughter of a Rebel!  The
capitalist-roader parents must be made to pay!"  While the girl was
being examined in the doctor's room a young man in the corridor, a
complete stranger, shouted, "Why don't you grab the capitalistroader
parents and beat them to death?"

When the doctor finished examining the girl, she came out and announced
that there was absolutely no sign that the girl had been raped.  The
scratches on her legs were not recent, and they could not have been
caused by Xiao-fang's piece of wood which, as she showed the crowd, was
painted and smooth.  They were probably caused by climbing a tree.  The
crowd dispersed, reluctantly.

That evening, Xiao-fang was delirious.  His face was dark red and he
screamed and raved incoherently.  The next day, my mother carried him
to a hospital, where a doctor gave him a large dose of tranquilizers.
After a few days he was well again, but he stopped playing with other
children.  With this incident, he practically said goodbye to his
childhood at the age of six.

Our move to Meteorite Street had been left to the resources of my
grandmother and us five children.  But by then we had the help of my
sister Xiao-hong's boyfriend, Cheng-yi.

Cheng-yi's father had been a minor official under the Kuomintang and
had not been able to get a proper job after 1949, partly because of his
undesirable past and partly because he had TB and a gastric ulcer.  He
did odd jobs like street cleaning and collecting the fees at a communal
water tap.  During the famine he and his wife, who were living in
Chongqing, died from illnesses aggravated by starvation.

Cheng-yi was a worker in an airplane engine factory, and had met my
sister at the beginning of 1968.  Like most people in the factory, he
was an inactive member of its major Rebel group, which was affiliated
with 26 August.

In those days, there was no entertainment, so most Rebel groups set up
their own song-and-dance troupes, which performed the few sanctioned
songs of Mao quotations and eulogies.  Cheng-yi, who was a good
musician, was a member of one such troupe.  Though she was not in the
factory, my sister, who loved dancing, joined it, together with Plumpie
and Ching-ching.  She and Cheng-yi soon fell in love.  The relationship
came under pressure from all sides: from his sister and his fellow
workers, who were worried 'that a liaison with a capitalist-roader
family would jeopardize his future; from our circle of high officials'
children, who scorned him for not being 'one of us," and from the
unreasonable me, who regarded my sister's desire to

live her own life as deserting our parents.  But their love survived,
and sustained my sister through the following difficult years.  I soon
came to like and respect Cheng-yi very much, as did all my family. 
Because he wore glasses, we took to calling him "Specs."

Another musician from the troupe, a friend of Specs, was a carpenter
and the son of a truck driver.  He was a jolly young man with a
spectacularly large nose which made him look somewhat un-Chinese.  In
those days the only foreigners whose pictures we saw often were
Albanians, because tiny, faraway Albania was China's only ally even the
North Koreans were considered to be too decadent.

His friends nicknamed him "AI," short for "Albanian."

AI came with a cart to help us move to Meteorite Street.

Not wanting to overtax him, I suggested we leave some things behind.
But he wanted us to take everything.  With a nonchalant smile, he
clenched his fists and proudly flexed his taut, bulging muscles.  My
brothers poked the hard lumps with great admiration.

AI was very keen on Plumpie.  The day after the move, he invited her,
Ching-ching, and me to lunch at his home, one of the common windowless
Chengdu houses with mud floors, which opened directly onto the
pavement.  This was the first time I had been in one of these houses.
When we reached Al's street, I saw a group of young men hanging about
on the corner.  Their eyes followed us as they said a pointed hello to
AI.  He flushed with pride, and went over to talk to them.  He came
back with an animated smile on his face.  In a casual tone he said, "I
told them you were high officials' children, and that I had made
friends with you so I could lay my hands on privileged goods when the
Cultural Revolution is over."

I was stunned.  First, what he said seemed to suggest that people
thought officials' children had access to consumer goods, which was not
the case.  Second, I was amazed at his obvious pleasure at being
associated with us, and the prestige this clearly gave him in the eyes
of his friends.  At the moment when my parents were in detention and we
had just been thrown out of the compound, when the Sichuan
Revolutionary Committee had been established and the capitalist-roaders
had been ousted, when the Cultural Revolution seemed to have won, AI
and his friends still apparently took it for granted that officials
like my parents would come back.

I was to encounter a similar attitude again and again.

Whenever I went out of the imposing gate of our courtyard, I was always
aware of the stares from people on Meteorite Street, stares which were
a mixture of curiosity and awe.

It was clear to me that the general public regarded the Revolutionary
Committees, rather than the capitalistroaders, as transient.

In the autumn of 1968 a new type of team came to take over my school;
they were called "Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams."  Made up of
soldiers or workers who had not been involved in factional fighting,
their task was to restore order.  In my school, as in all others, the
team recalled all the pupils who had been in the school when the
Cultural Revolution started two years before, so they could be kept
under control.  Those few who were out of the city were tracked down
and summoned back by telegram.  Few dared to stay away.

Back at school, the teachers who had not fallen victim did no teaching.
They did not dare.  The old textbooks had all been condemned as
'bourgeois poison," and nobody was brave enough to write new ones.  So
we just sat in classes reciting Mao's articles and reading People's
Daily editorials.

We sang songs of Mao's quotations, or gathered to dance 'loyalty
dances," gyrating and waving our Little Red Books.

Making 'loyalty dances' compulsory was one of the major orders issued
by the Revolutionary Committees throughout China.  This absurd twisting
was mandatory everywhere:

in schools and factories, on the streets, in shops, on railway

My Siblings and~r Friends 5o3 platforms, even in hospitals for the
patients who could still move.

On the whole, the propaganda team sent to my school was fairly benign.
Others were not.  The one at Chengdu University was hand-picked by the
Tings because the university had been the headquarters of their enemy
Red Chengdu.  Yan and Yong suffered more than most.  The Tings
instructed the propaganda team to put pressure on them to condemn my
father.  They refused.  They later told my mother that they so admired
my father's courage that they decided to take a stand.

By the end of 1968, all university students in China had been summarily
'graduated' en masse, without any exam, assigned jobs, and dispersed to
every corner of the land.

Yan and Yong were warned that if they did not denounce my father, they
would have no future.  But they stuck to their guns.  Yan was sent to a
small coal mine in the mountains of east Sichuan.  This was just about
the worst job possible; the work conditions were extremely primitive
and there were virtually no safety measures.  Women, like men, had to
crawl down the pit on all fours to drag the coal baskets out.  Yan's
fate was partly the result of the twisted rhetoric of the time: Mme Mao
had been insisting on women doing the same kind of work as men, and one
of the slogans of the day was Mao's saying "Women can hold up half the
sky."  But women knew that when they were given the privilege of this
equality they were in for hard physical labor.

Immediately after the expulsion of university students, middle-school
pupils like me discovered that we were to be exiled to faraway rural
and mountainous areas to do backbreaking farm labor.  Mao intended me
to spend the rest of my life as a peasant.

22.  "Thought Reform through Labor'-To the Edge of the Himahyas
(January-June 1909)

In i 969 my parents, my sister, my brother Jin-ming, and I were
expelled from Chengdu one after another, and sent to distant parts of
the Sichuan wilderness.  We were among millions of urban dwellers to be
exiled to the countryside.

In this way, young people would not be roaming the cities with nothing
to do, creating trouble out of sheer boredom, and adults like my
parents would have a 'future."  They were part of the old
administration which had been replaced by Mao's Revolutionary
Committees, and packing them off to the sticks to do hard labor was a
convenient solution.

According to Mao's rhetoric, we were sent to the countryside 'to be
reformed."  Mao advocated 'thought reform through labor' for everyone,
but never explained the relationship between the two.  Of course, no
one asked for clarification.  Merely to contemplate such a question was
tantamount to treason.  In reality, everyone in China knew that hard
labor, particularly in the countryside, was always punishment.  It was
noticeable that none of Mao's

To the Edge of the Himalayas 505 henchmen, the members of the newly
established Revolutionary Committees, army officers and very few of
their children had to do it.

The first of us to be expelled was my father.  Just after New Year 1969
he was sent to Miyi County in the region of Xichang, on the eastern
edge of the Himalayas, an area so remote that it is China's satellite
launch base today.  It lies about 300 miles from Chengdu, four days'
journey by truck, as there was no railway.  In ancient times, the area
was used for dumping exiles, because its mountains and waters were said
to be permeated with a mysterious 'evil air."  In today's terms, the
'evil air' was subtropical diseases.

A camp was set up there to accommodate the former staff of the
provincial government.  There were thousands of such camps throughout
China.  They were called 'cadres' schools," but apart from the fact
that they were not schools, they were not just for officials either.
Writers, scholars, scientists, teachers, doctors, and actors who had
become 'useless' in Mao's know-nothing new order were also dispatched
there.

Among officials, it was not only capitalist-roaders like my father and
other class enemies who were packed off to the camps.  Most of their
Rebel colleagues were also expelled, as the new Sichuan Revolutionary
Committee could not accommodate anything like all of them, having
filled its posts with Rebels from other backgrounds like workers and
students, and with army men.

"Thought reform through labor' became a handy way of dealing with the
surplus Rebels.  In my father's depa,iment only a few stayed in
Chengdu.  Mrs.  Shau became deputy director of Public Affairs on the
Sichuan Revolutionary Committee.

All Rebel organizations were now disbanded.

The 'cadres' schools' were not concentration camps or gulags, but they
were isolated places of detention where the inmates had restricted
freedom and had to do hard labor under strict supervision.  Because
every cultivable area in China is densely populated, only in arid or
moun 506 "Thought Reform through Labor' tai nous areas was there space
to contain the exiles from the cities.  The inmates were supposed to
produce food and be self supporting.  Although they were still paid
salaries, there was lit He for them to buy.  Life was very harsh.

In order to prepare for his trip, my father was released from his place
of detention in Chengdu a few days before his departure.  The only
thing he wanted to do was to see my mother.  She was still being
detained, and he thought he might never see her again.  He wrote to the
Revolutionary Committee, as humbly as he could, begging to be allowed
to see her.  His request was turned down.

The cinema in which my mother was being kept was on what used to be the
busiest shopping street in Chengdu.

Now the shops were half empty, but the black market for semiconductor
parts which my brother Jin-ming frequented was nearby, and he sometimes
saw my mother walking along the street in a line of detainees, carrying
a bowl and a pair of chopsticks.  The canteen in the cinema did not
operate every day, so the detainees had to go out for their meals from
time to time.  Jin-ming's discovery meant we could sometimes see our
mother by waiting on the street.  Occasionally she did not appear with
the other detainees, and we would be consumed by anxiety.  We did not
know that those were the times when her psychopath guard was punishing
her by denying her permission to go and eat.  But perhaps the next day
we would catch sight of her, one among a dozen or so silent and
grim-looking men and women, their heads bowed, all wearing white
armbands with four sinister black characters: 'ox devil, snake
demon."

I took my father to the street for several days running, and we waited
there from dawn fill lunchtime.  But there was no sign of her.  We
would walk up and down, stamping our feet on the frost-covered pavement
to keep warm.  One morning, we were again watching the thick fog lift
to reveal the lifeless cement buildings, when my mother appeared.

Having seen her children many times on the street, she

To the Edge of the Himalayas 5o7 looked up quickly to see whether we
were there this time Her eyes met my father's.  Their lips quivered,
but no sounds came out.  They just locked eyes until the guard shouted
at my mother to lower her head.  Long after she had turned the corner,
my father stood gazing after her.

A couple of days later, my father was gone.  Despite his calm and
reserve, I detected signs his nerves were on the verge of snapping.  I
was desperately worried that he might go out of his mind again,
particularly now that he had to suffer his physical and mental torment
in solitude, without his family nearby.  I resolved to go and keep him
company soon, but it was extremely difficult to find transport to Miyi,
as public services to such remote areas were paralyzed.  So when I was
told some days later that my school was being dispatched to a place
called Ningnan, which was only about fifty miles from his camp, I was
delighted.

In January 1969, every middle school in Chengdu was sent to a rural
area somewhere in Sichuan.  We were to live in villages among the
peasants and be 'reeducated' by them.  What exactly they were supposed
to educate us in was not made specific, but Mao always maintained that
people with some education were inferior to illiterate peasants, and
needed to reform to be more like them.  One of his sayings was:
"Peasants have dirty hands and cowshitsodden feet, but they are much
cleaner than intellectuals."

My school and my sister's were full of children of capitalist-roaders,
so they were sent to particularly godforsaken places.  None of the
children of members of the Revolutionary Committees went.  They joined
the armed services, which was the only, and much cushier, alternative
to the countryside.  Starting at this time, one of the clearest signs
of power was for one's children to be in the army.

Altogether, some fifteen million young people were sent to the country
in what was one of the largest population movements in history.  It was
an indication of the order within the chaos that this was swiftly and
supremely well organized.  Everyone was given a subsidy to help buy
extra clothes, quilts, sheets, suitcases, mosquito nets, and plastic
sheets for wrapping up bedrolls.  Minute attention was paid to such
details as providing us with sneakers, water cans, and torches.  Most
of these things had to be manufactured specially, as they were not
available in the poorly stocked shops.  Those from poor families could
apply for extra financial help.  For the first year we were to be
provided by the state with pocket money and food rations, including
rice, cooking oil, and meat.  These were to be collected from the
village to which we were assigned.

Since the Great Leap Forward, the countryside had been organized into
communes, each of which grouped together a number of villages and could
contain anywhere from 2,000 to 20,000 households.  Under the commune
came production brigades which, in turn, governed several production
teams.  A production team was roughly equivalent to a village, and was
the basic unit of rural life.  In my school, up to eight pupils were
assigned to each production team, and we were allowed to choose with
whom we wanted to form a group.  I chose my friends from Plumpie's
form.  My sister chose to go with me instead of with her school: we
were allowed to opt to go to a place with a relative.  My brother
Jin-ming, though he was in the same school as I, stayed in Chengdu
because he was not yet sixteen, which was the cutoff age.  Plumpie did
not go either, because she was an only child.

I looked forward to Ningnan.  I had had no real experience of physical
hardship and lit He appreciated what it meant.  I imagined an idyllic
environment where there was no politics.  An official had come from
Ningnan to talk to us, and he had described the subtropical climate
with its high blue sky, huge red hibiscus flowers, foot-long bananas,
and the Golden Sand River the upper part of the Yangtze shining in the
bright sun, rippled by gentle breezes.

I was living in a world of gray mist and black wall slogans, and
sunshine and tropical vegetation were like a dream to

?

~v me.  Listening to the official, I pictured myself in a mountain of
blossoms with a golden fiver at my feet.  He mentioned the mysterious
'evil air' which I had read about in classical literature, but even
that added a touch of ancient eroticism.  Danger existed for me only in
political campaigns.

I was also eager to go because I thought it would be easy to visit my
father.  But I failed to notice that between us lay pathless mountains
10,000 feet high.  I have never been much good at maps.

On 27 January 1969, my school set off for Ningnan.

Each pupil was allowed to take one suitcase and a bedroll.

We were loaded into trucks, about three dozen of us in each.  There
were only a few seats; most of us sat on our bedrolls or on the floor.
The column of trucks bumped up and down country roads for three days
before we reached the border of Xichang.  We passed through the Chengdu
Plain and the mountains along the eastern edge of the Himalayas, where
the trucks had to put on chains.  I tried to sit near the back so I
could watch the dramatic snow showers and hail which whitened the
universe, and which almost instantly cleared into turquoise sky and
dazzling sunshine.  This tempestuous beauty left me speechless.  In the
distance to the west rose a peak almost 25,000 feet high, beyond which
lay the ancient wilderness in which were born many of the world's
flora.  I only realized when I came to the West that such everyday
sights as rhododendrons, chrysanthemums, most roses, and many other
flowers came from here.  It was still inhabited by pandas.

The second evening we entered a place called Asbestos County, named
after its major product.  Somewhere in the mountains, our convoy
stopped so we could use the toilets two mud huts containing round
communal pits covered with maggots.  But if the sight inside the toilet
was revolting, the one outside was horrifying.  The faces of the
workers were ashen, the color of lead, and devoid of any animation.

Terrified, I asked a nice propaganda team man, Dong-an,

5xo "Thought RqCorrn through Labor' who was taking us to our
destination, who these zombie like people were.  Convicts from a
lao-gai ('reform through labor') camp, he replied.  Because asbestos
mining was highly noxious, it was mainly done by forced labor, with few
safety or health precautions.  This was my first, and only, encounter
with China's gulag.

On the fifth day, the truck unloaded us at a granary at the top of a
mountain.  Propaganda publicity had led me to expect a ceremony with
people beating drums and pinning red paper flowers on the new arrivals
with great fanfare, but all that happened was that a commune official
came to meet us at the grain station.  He made a speech of welcome in
the stilted jargon of the newspapers.  A couple of dozen peasants were
there to help us with our bedrolls and suitcases.  Their faces were
blank and inscrutable, and their speech was unintelligible to me.

My sister and I walked to our new home with the two other girls and
four boys who made up our group.  The four peasants who carried some of
our luggage walked in complete silence, and did not seem to understand
the questions we put to them.  We fell into silence, too.  For hours we
trekked in single file, deeper and deeper into the great universe of
dark-green mountains.  But I was far too exhausted to notice their
beauty.  Once, after I had been struggling to support myself against a
rock to catch my breath, I looked around, into the distance.  Our group
seemed so insignificant amid the vast, boundless mountain world, with
no roads, no houses, and no other human beings in sight, only the wind
soughing through the forests, and the purling of hidden streams.  I
felt I was disappearing into a hushed, alien wilderness.

At dusk, we arrived at the lightless village.  There was no
electricity, and oil was too precious to be wasted if it was not
completely dark.  People stood by their doors and stared at us with
open-mouthed blankness; I did not know flit denoted interest or
indifference.  It was stares like these which many foreigners
encountered in China after it was first opened in the 197OS.  Indeed,
we were like foreigners to the peasants and they to us.

The village had prepared a residence for us, made of timber and mud and
comprising two big rooms one for the four boys, and one for the four
girls.  A corridor led to the village hall, where a brick stove had
been built for us to cook on.

I fell exhausted onto the hard plank of wood that was the bed I was to
share with my sister.  Some children followed us, making excited
noises.  They now started banging on our door, but when we opened it
they would scamper away, only to reappear to rap on the door again.
They peeped into our window, which was just a square hole in the wall,
with no shutter, and screamed odd noises.  At first we smiled and
invited them in, but our friendliness met no response.  I was desperate
for a wash.  We nailed an old shirt onto the window frame as a curtain
and began to dip our towels into the freezing water in our washbasins.
I tried to ignore the children's giggles as they repeatedly flipped up
the 'curtain."  We had to keep our padded jackets on while we washed.

One of the boys in our group acted as leader and liaison with the
villagers.  We had a few days, he told us, to get all our daily
necessities like water, kerosene, and firewood organized; after that we
would have to start working in the fields.

Everything at Ningnan was done manually, the way it had been for at
least 2,000 years.  There was no machinery and no draft animals,
either.  The peasants were too short of food to be able to afford any
for horses or donkeys.  For our arrival the villagers had filled a
round earthenware water tank for us.  The next day I realized how
precious every drop was.  To get water, we had to climb for thirty
minutes up narrow paths to the well, carrying a pair of wooden barrels
on a shoulder pole.  They weighed ninety pounds when they were full. My
shoulders ached agonizingly even when they were empty.  I was vastly
relieved when the boys gallantly declared
that fetching water was their job.

They cooked, too, as three out of us four girls, me included, had never
cooked in our lives, having come from the kind of families we did.  Now
I began to learn to cook the hard way.  The grain came un husked and
had to be put into a stone mortar and beaten with all one's might with
a heavy pestle.  Then the mixture had to be poured into a big shallow
bamboo basket, which was swung with a particular movement of the arms
so that the light shells gathered on top and could be scooped away,
leaving the rice behind.  After a couple of minutes my arms became
unbearably sore and soon were shaking so much I could not pick up the
basket.  It was an exhausting battle for every meal.

Then we had to collect fuel.  It was two hours' walk to the woods
designated by the forest protection regulations as the area where we
could collect firewood.  We were only allowed to chop small branches,
so we climbed up the short pines and slashed ferociously with our
knives.  The logs were bundled together and carried on our backs.  I
was the youngest in our group, so I only had to carry a basket of
feathery pine needles.  The journey home was another couple of hours,
up and down mountain paths.  I was so exhausted when I got back that I
felt my load must weigh 140 pounds at least.  I could not believe my
eyes when I put my basket on the scales: it came to only five pounds.

This would burn up in no lime: it was not enough even to boil a wok of
water.

On one of the first trips to gather fuel, I tore the seat of my
trousers getting down from a tree.  I was so embarrassed I hid in the
woods and came out last so no one could walk behind me and see.  The
boys, who were all perfect gentlemen, kept insisting I should go in
front so they would not walk too fast for me.  I had to repeat many
times that I was happy to go last, and that I was not just being
polite.

To the Edge of the Himalayas 513 Even going to the toilet was no easy
job.  It involved climbing down a steep, slippery slope to a deep pit
next To the goaffold.  One always had either one's bottom or one's head
toward the goats, who were keen to butt at intruders.

I was so nervous I could not move my bowels for days.

Once out of the goat fold it was a struggle to clamber up the slope
again.  Every time I came back I had new bruises on me somewhere.

On our first day working with the peasants, I was assigned to carry
goat droppings and manure from our toilet up to the tiny fields which
had just been burned free of bushes and grass.  The ground was now
covered by a layer of plant ash that, together with the goat and human
excrement, was to fertilize the soil for the spring plowing, which was
done manually.

I loaded the heavy basket on my back and desperately crawled up the
slope on all fours.  The manure was fairly dry, but still some of it
began to soak through onto my cotton jacket and through to my underwear
and my back.

It also slopped over the top of the basket and seeped into my hair.
When I finally arrived at the field I saw the peasant women skillfully
unloading by bending their waists sideways and tilting the baskets in
such a way that the contents poured out.  But I could not make mine
pour.  In my desperation to get rid of the weight on my back I tried to
take the basket off.  I slipped my right arm out of its strap, and
suddenly the basket lurched with a tremendous pull to the left, taking
my left shoulder with it.  I fell to the ground into the manure.  Some
time later, a friend dislocated her knee like this.  I only strained my
waist slightly.

Hardship was part of the 'thought reform."  In theory, it was to be
relished, as it brought one closer to becoming a new person, more like
the peasants.  Before the Cultural Revolution, I had subscribed
wholeheartedly to this naive attitude, and had deliberately done hard
work in order to make myself a better person.  Once in the spring of x
966 my form was helping with some roadwork.  The girls were asked to do
light jobs like separating out stones which were then broken up by the
boys.  I offered to do the boys' work and ended up with horribly
swollen arms from crushing stones with a huge sledgehammer which I
could hardly lift.  Now, scarcely three years later, my indoctrination
was collapsing.  With the psychological support of blind belief gone, I
found myself hating the hardship in the mountains of Ningnan.  It
seemed utterly pointless.

I developed a serious skin rash as soon as I arrived.  For over three
years this rash recurred the moment I was in the country, and no
medicine seemed able to cure it.  I was tormented by itchiness day and
night, and could not stop myself from scratching.  Within three weeks
of star fng my new life I had several sores running with pus, and my
legs were swollen from infections.  I was also hit by diarrhea and
vomiting.  I was hatefully weak and sick all the time when I needed
physical strength most, and the commune clinic was thirty-odd miles
away.

I soon came to the conclusion that I had lit He chance of visiting my
father from Ningnan.  The nearest proper road was a day's hard walk
away, and even when one got there, there was no public transport.
Trucks were few and far between, and they were extremely unlikely to be
going from where I was to Miyi.  Fortunately, the propaganda team man,
Dong-an, came to our village to check that we were settled in all
right, and when he saw I was ill he kindly suggested I should go back
to Chengdu for treatment.  He was returning with the last of the trucks
which had brought us to Ningnan.  Twenty-six days after I had arrived,
I set off back to Chengdu.

As I was leaving I realized that I had hardly got to know the peasants
in our village.  My only acquaintance was the village accountant who,
being the most educated man around, came to see us often to claim some
intellectual kinship.  His home was the only one I had been in, and
what I remember most were the suspicious stares on his young wife's
weather-beaten face.  She was cleaning the bloody intestines of a pig,
and had a silent baby on her back.  When I said hello, she shot me an
indifferent look and did not return my greeting.  I felt alien and
awkward, and soon left.

In the few days I actually worked with the villagers, I had lit He
spare energy and did not talk to them properly.

They seemed remote, uninterested, separated from me by the impenetrable
Ningnan mountains.  I knew we were supposed to make the effort to visit
them, as my friends and my sister, who were in better shape, were doing
in the evenings, but I was exhausted, sick, and itchy all the time.

Besides, visiting them would have meant that I was resigned to making
the best of my life there.  And I subconsciously refused to settle for
a life as a peasant.  Without spelling it out to myself, I rejected the
life Mao had assigned to me.

When the time came for me to leave, I suddenly missed the extraordinary
beauty of Ningnan.  I had not appreciated the mountains properly when I
was struggling with life there.  Spring had come early, in February,
and golden winter jasmines shone beside the icicles hanging from the
pines.  The brooks in the valleys formed one crystal-clear pool after
another, dotted around which were fancifully shaped rocks.  The
reflections in the water were of gorgeous clouds, canopies of stately
trees, and the nameless blossoms that elegantly wriggled out of the
cracks in the rocks.  We washed clothes in those heavenly pools, and
spread them on the rocks to dry in the sunshine and the crisp air. Then
we would lie down on the grass and listen to the vibration of the pine
forests in the breeze.  I would marvel at the slopes of distant
mountains opposite us, covered with wild peach trees, and imagine the
masses of pink in a few weeks' time.

When I reached Chengdu, after four interminable days of being thrown
about in the back of an empty truck, with constant stomach pains and
diarrhea, I went straight to the

5 x6 "Thought Rqbrm through Labor' clinic attached to the compound.
Injections and tablets cured me in no time.  Like the canteen, the
clinic was still open to my family.  The Sichuan Revolutionary
Committee was split and second-rate: it had not managed to organize a
functioning administration.  It had not even got around to issuing
regulations concerning many aspects of everyday life.  As a result, the
system was full of holes; many of the old ways continued, and people
were largely left to their own devices.  The managements of the canteen
and the clinic did not refuse to serve us, so we went on enjoying the
facilities.

in addition to the Western injections and pills prescribed at the
clinic, my grandmother said I needed Chinese medicines.  One day she
came home with a chicken and some roots of membranous milk vetch and
Chinese angelica, which were considered very bu (healing), and made a
soup for me into which she sprinkled finely chopped spring onions.
These ingredients were unavailable in the shops, and she had hobbled
for miles to buy them in a country black market.

My grandmother was unwell herself.  Sometimes I saw her lying on her
bed, which was extremely unusual for her;

she had always been so energetic I had hardly ever seen her sit still
for a minute.  Now her eyes were shut tight and she bit her lips hard,
which made me feel she must be in great pain.  But when I asked her
what the matter was, she would say it was nothing, and she continued
collecting medicines and standing in line to get food for me.

I was soon much better.  As there was no authority to order me to
return to Ningnan, I began to plan a trip to see my father.  But then a
telegram came from Yibin saying that my aunt Jun-ying, who had been
looking after my youngest brother, Xiao-fang, was seriously ill.  I
thought I should go and take care of them.

Aunt Jun-ying and my father's other relations in Yibin had been very
kind to my family, in spite of the fact that my father had broken the
deep-rooted Chinese tradition of looking after one's relatives.  By
tradition, it was considered the filial duty of a son to prepare for
his mother a heavy wooden coffin with many layers of paint, and to
provide a grand and often financially crippling- funeral.

But the government strongly encouraged cremation to save land and
simpler funerals.  When his mother died in 1958, my father was not told
until after the funeral, because his family was worried that he would
object to the burial and the elaborate service.  After we moved to
Chengdu his family hardly ever visited us.

However, when my father fell into trouble in the Cultural Revolution,
they came to see us and offered their help.  Aunt Jun-ying, who had
been traveling frequently between Chengdu and Yibin, eventually took
Xiao-fang under her care to relieve my grandmother of some of her
burden.  She shared a house with my father's youngest sister, but had
also selflessly given up half of her part to the family of a distant
relative who had had to abandon their own dilapidated lodgings.

When I arrived, my aunt was sitting in a wicker easy chair by the front
door to the hall, which served as the sitting room.  In the place of
honor lay a huge coffin made of heavy, dark-red wood.  This coffin, her
own, was her only indulgence.  The sight of my aunt overwhelmed me with
sadness.  She had just had a stroke, and her legs were half-paralyzed.
Hospitals were working only sporadically.

With no one to repair them, facilities had broken down and the supply
of medicine was erratic.  The hospitals had told Aunt Jun-ying there
was nothing they could do for her, so she stayed at home.

What my aunt found most traumatic were her bowel movements.  After
eating, she felt unbearably bloated, but she could not relieve herself
without great agony.  Her relatives' formulas helped sometimes, but
more often failed.  I massaged her stomach frequently, and once, when
she felt desperate and asked me to, I even put my finger into her anus
to try to scratch out the excrement.  All these remedies only gave her
momentary relief.  As a result, she did not dare to eat much.  She was
terribly weak, and would sit in the wicker chair in the hall for hours,
gazing at the papaya and banana trees in the back garden.  She never
complained.  Only once did she say to me in a gentle whisper, "I'm so
very hungry.  I wish I could eat..."

She could no longer walk without help, and even sitting up required a
great effort.  To prevent her getting bedsores, I would sit beside her
so she could lean on me.  She said I was a good nurse and that I must
be tired and bored sitting there.  No matter how much I insisted, she
would only sit for a brief period every day, so that I could 'go out
and have some fun."

Of course, there was no fun outside.  I longed for something to read.
But apart from the four volumes of The Seleaed Works of Mao Zedong, all
I discovered in the house was a dictionary.  Everything else had been
burned.  I occupied myself with studying the 15,000 characters in it,
learning the ones I did not know by heart.

I spent the rest of my time looking after my seven-year old brother,
Xiao-fang, and took long walks with him.

Sometimes he got bored and demanded things like a toy gun or the
charcoal-colored sweets that were on lonely display in the shops.  But
I had no money our basic allowance was small.  Xiao-fang, at seven,
could not understand this, and would throw himself on the dusty ground,
kicking, yelling, and tearing my jacket.  I would crouch and coax and
eventually, at my wits' end, start crying as well.

At this, he would stop and make up with me.  We would both go home
exhausted.

Yibin was a very atmospheric town, even in the middle of the Cultural
Revolution.  The waving rivers and serene hills, and the hazy horizon
beyond, produced a sense of eternity in me, and soothed me temporarily
from the miseries all around.  When dusk fell, the posters and
loudspeakers all over the city were obscured, and the unlit back lanes
were enveloped in mist, broken only by the flickering of oil lamps
seeping through the cracks between the frames of the doors and the
windows.  From time to time, there was a bright patch: a small food
stall was open.  There was not much for sale, but there would be a
square wooden table on the pavement, with four long narrow benches
around it, all dark brown and shiny from years of rubbing and sitting.
On the table would be a tiny pea-shaped spark - a lamp that burned
rapeseed oil.  There was never anyone sitting at these tables chatting,
but the owner kept the stall open.  In the old days, it would have been
crowded with people gossiping and drinking the local 'five-grained
liquor," accompanied by marinated beef, soy-stewed pig's tongue, and
salt-and-pepper roasted peanuts.  The empty stalls evoked for me a
Yibin in the days when life had not been completely taken over by
politics.

Once out of the back lanes, my ears were assaulted by loudspeakers. For
up to eighteen hours a day the town center was a perpetual hubbub of
chanting and denouncing.  Quite apart from the content, the noise level
was unbearable, and I had to develop a technique of forcing myself to
hear nothing to preserve my sanity.

One evening in April, a broadcast suddenly caught my attention.  A
Party Congress had been convened in Peking.

As usual, the Chinese people were not told what this most important
assembly of their 'representatives' was actually doing.  A new top
leadership team was announced.  My heart sank as I heard that the new
organization of the Cultural Revolution was confirmed.

This Congress, the Ninth, marked the formal establishment of Mao's
personal power system.  Few senior leaders from the previous Congress,
in 1956, had made it to this one.  Out of seventeen Politburo members,
only four Mao, Lin Biao, Zhou Enlai, and Li Xiannian were still in
office.  All the rest, apart from those already dead, had been
denounced and ousted.  Some of these were soon to die.

President Liu Shaoqi, the number-two man at the

Eighth Congress, had been under detention since 1967, and was
ferociously beaten at denunciation meetings.  He was denied medicine
for both his long-term illness, diabetes, and his newly caught
pneumonia, and was given treatment only when he was on the brink of
death because Mme Mao explicitly ordered that he be kept alive so the
Ninth Congress would 'have a living target."  At the Congress the
verdict that he was 'a criminal traitor, enemy agent, and scab in the
service of the imperialists, modern revisionists [Russians], and the
Kuomintang reactionaries' was read by Zhou Enlai.  After the Congress,
Liu was allowed to die, in agony.

Marshal Ho Lung, another former Politburo member and a founder of the
Communist army, died scarcely two months after the Congress.  Because
he had wielded power in the army, he was subjected to two and a half
years of slow torture, which, he said to his wife, was 'intended to
destroy my health so they can murder me without spilling my blood." The
torment included allowing him only a small can of water every day
during the boiling summer, cutting off all heating during the winter,
when the temperature remained well below zero for months on end, and
denying him medicine for his diabetes.  In the end, he died after a
large dose of glucose was administered when his diabetes got worse.

Tao Zhu, the Politburo member who had helped my mother at the start of
the Cultural Revolution, was detained under inhuman conditions for
nearly three years, which destroyed his health.  He was denied proper
treatment until his gallbladder cancer was far advanced and Zhou Enlai
sanctioned an operation.  But the windows in his hospital room were
permanently blacked out with newspapers, and his family was not allowed
to see him at his deathbed or after his death.

Marshal Peng Dehuai died of the same kind of drawn out torment, which
in his case lasted eight years, until 1974.  His last request was to
see the trees and the daylight outside his newspaper-covered hospital
windows, and it was turned down.

These and many similar persecutions were typical of Mao's methods in
the Cultural Revolution.  Instead of signing death warrants Mao would
simply indicate his intentions, and some people would volunteer to
carry out the tormenting and improvise the gruesome details.  Their
methods included mental pressure, physical brutality, and denial of
medical care or even the use of medicine to kill.  Death caused in this
way came to have a special term in Chinese: po-had zhi-si - 'persecuted
to death."  Mao was fully aware of what was happening, and would
encourage the perpetrators by giving his 'silent consent' (mo-xu). This
enabled him to get rid of his enemies without attracting blame. The
responsibility was inescapably his, but not his alone.  The tormentors
took some initiative.  Mao's subordinates were always on the lookout
for ways to please him by anticipating his wishes and, of course, to
indulge their own sadistic tendencies.

The horrible details of the persecutions of many top leaders were not
revealed until years later.  When they came out, they surprised no one
in China.  We knew all too many similar cases from our own
experience.

As I stood in the crowded square listening to the broadcast, the new
Central Committee was read out.  With dread I waited for the names of
the Tings.  And there they were - Liu Jie-ting and Zhang Xi-ting.  Now
I felt there was to be no end to my family's suffering.

Shortly afterward a telegram came saying my grandmother had collapsed
and taken to her bed.  She had never done anything like this before.
Aunt Jun-ying urged me to go home and look after her.  Xiao-fang and I
took the next train back to Chengdu.

My grandmother was approaching her sixtieth birthday, and her stoicism
had at last been conquered by pain.  She felt it piercing and moving
all over her body, then concentrating in her ears.  The doctors at the
compound clinic said it might be nerves, and that they had no cure for
it except that she should maintain a cheerful mood.  I took her to a
hospital half an hour's walk from Meteorite Street.

Ensconced in their chauffeur-driven cars, the new holders of power felt
little concern for how ordinary people had to live.  Buses were not
running in Chengdu, as they were not considered vital to the
revolution, and pedicabs had been banned, on the grounds that they
exploited labor.

My grandmother could not walk because of the intense pain.  She had to
sit on the luggage rack of a bicycle, with a cushion on it, holding on
to the seat.  I pushed the bicycle, Xiao-her propped her up, and
Xiao-fang sat on the crossbar.

The hospital was still working, thanks to the professionalism and
dedication of some of the staff.  On its brick walls, I saw huge
slogans from their more militant colleagues accusing them of 'using
work to suppress revolution' - a standard accusation for people
sticking to their jobs.  The doctor we saw had twitching eyelids and
black rings under her eyes, and I guessed she must be exhausted by the
throngs of patients, in addition to the political attacks she was
having to endure.  The hospital was bursting at the seams with
grim-looking men and women, some with bruised faces, others with broken
ribs lying on stretchers victims of denunciation meetings.

None of the doctors could diagnose what was wrong with my grandmother.
There was no X-ray machine or any other instrument to examine her
properly.  They were all broken.  My grandmother was given various
painkillers.

When these failed to work, she was admitted to the hospital.  The wards
were crowded, the beds jammed right up against each other.  Even the
corridors were lined with beds.  The few nurses rushing from ward to
ward could not manage to look after all the patients, so I decided to
stay with my grandmother.

I went home and got some utensils so I could cook for her there.  I
also brought a bamboo mattress which I spread under her bed.  At night
I was constantly awakened by her groaning, and I would climb out from
under my thin quilt and massage her, which soothed her temporarily.
From under the bed, the room smelled intensely of urine.  Everyone's
chamber pot was placed next to the bed.  My grandmother was very fussy
about cleanliness, and she would insist on getting up and going to the
toilet down the corridor even at night.  But the other patients did not
bother, and often the chamber pots were not emptied for days.  The
nurses were too busy to attend to such details.

The window by my grandmother's bed looked out over the front garden. It
was overgrown with weeds, and its wooden benches were collapsing. The
first time I looked out at it, several children were busy trying to
break off the few branches of a small magnolia tree that still had one
or two flowers on them.  Adults walked by indifferently.

Vandalism against trees had become too much a part of everyday life to
attract any attention.

One day, from the open window, I saw Bing, a friend of mine, getting
off his bicycle.  My heart started to leap, and my face suddenly felt
hot.  I quickly checked in the windowpane.  To look into a real mirror
in public was to invite condemnation as a 'bourgeois element."  I was
wearing a pink-and-white checked jacket, a pattern that had just been
allowed for young women's clothing.  Long hair was permissible again,
but only in two plaits, and I would dither for hours over how I should
do mine: Should they be close together or far apart?  Straight, or
curved a lit He at the ends?  Should the plaited part be longer than
the loose part, or vice versa?  The decisions, all minute, were
endless.  There were no state regulations about hairstyles or clothes.
It was what everyone else was wearing that determined the rules of the
day.  And because the range was so narrow, people were always looking
out for the tiniest variations.  It was a real test of ingenuity to
look different and attractive, and yet similar enough to every body
else so that nobody with an accusing finger could pinpoint what exactly
was heretical.

I was still wondering how I looked when Bing walked into the ward.  His
appearance was nothing out of the ordinary, but a certain air set him
apart.  He had a touch of cynicism, which was rare in those humorless
years.  I was very much drawn to him.  His father had been a
departmental director in the pre-Cultural Revolution provincial
government, but Bing was different from most other high officials'
children.

"Why should I be sent to the countryside?"  he said, and actually
succeeded in not going by obtaining an 'incurable illness' certificate.
He was the first person to show me a free intelligence, an ironic,
inquisitive mind which did not take anything for granted.  It was he
who first opened up the taboo areas in my mind.

Up to now, I had shunned any love relationship.  My devotion to my
family, which had been intensified by adversity, overshadowed every
other emotion.  Although within me there had always been another being,
a sexual being, yearning to get out, I had succeeded in keeping it
locked in.  Knowing Bing pulled me to the brink of an entanglement.

On this day, Bing turned up at my grandmother's ward with a black eye.
He said he had just been hit by Wen, a young man who had come back from
Ningnan as the escort for a girl who had broken her leg there.  Bing
described the fight with deliberate nonchalance, saying with a great
deal of satisfaction that Wen was jealous of him for enjoying more of
my attention and company.  Later, I heard Wen's story: he had hit Bing
because he could not stand 'that conceited grin of his."

Wen was short and stout, with big hands and feet and buck teeth.  Like
Bing, he was the son of high officials.  He took to rolling up his
sleeves and trouser legs and wearing a pair of straw sandals like a
peasant, in the spirit of a model youth in the propaganda posters.  One
day he told me he was going back to Ningnan to continue 'reforming'

himself.  When I asked why, he said casually, "To follow Chairman Mao.
Why else?  I'm Chairman Mao's Red Guard."  For a moment I was
speechless.  I had begun to assume that people only spouted this sort
of jargon on official occasions.  What was more, he had not put on the
obligatory solemn face that was part of the act.  The offhanded way he
spoke made me feel he was sincere.

Wen's way of thinking did not make me want to avoid him.  The Cultural
Revolution had taught me not to divide people by their beliefs, but by
whether they were capable of cruelty and viciousness or not.  I knew
Wen was a decent person, and when I wanted to get out of Ningnan
permanently, it was to him that I turned for help.

I had been away from Ningnan for over two months.

There was no rule that forbade this, but the regime had a powerful
weapon to make sure I would have to go back to the mountains sooner or
later: my residence registration had been moved there from Chengdu, and
as long as I stayed in the city, I was entitled to no food or any other
rations.  For the time being I was living off my family's rations, but
that could not last forever.  I realized that I had to get my
registration moved to somewhere near Chengdu.

Chengdu itself was out of the question, because no one was allowed to
move a country registration to a city.  Moving one's registration from
a harsh mountainous place to a richer area like the plain around
Chengdu was also forbidden.  But there was a loophole: we could move if
we had relatives who were willing to accept us.  It was possible to
invent such a relative, as no one could keep track of the numerous
relatives a Chinese might have.

I planned the transfer with Nana, a good friend of mine who was just
back from Ningnan to try to find a way to get out of there.  We
included my sister, who was still in Ningnan, in our plan.  To get our
registrations moved, we first of all needed three letters: one from a
commune saying it would accept us, on the recommendation of a relative
in that commune; a second from the county to which the commune
belonged, endorsing the first; and a third from the Sichuan Bureau for
City Youth, sanctioning the transfer.  When we had all three, we had to
go back to our production teams in Ningnan to obtain their approval
before the registrar at Ningnan county would give us the final release.
Only then could we be given the crucial document, which was essential
for every citizen in China our registration books which we had to hand
in to the authorities at our next place of residence.

Life was always as daunting and complex as this whenever one took even
the smallest step outside the authorities' rigid plan.  And in most
cases there were unexpected complications.  While I was planning how to
arrange the transfer, out of the blue the central government issued a
regulation freezing all registration transfers as of 11 June.

It was already the third week in May.  It would be impossible to locate
a real relative who would accept us and go through all the procedures
in time.

I turned to Wen.  Without hesitating for a moment, he offered to
'create' the three letters.  Forging official documents was a serious
offense, punishable by a long prison sentence.  But Mao's devoted Red
Guard shrugged off my words of caution.

The crucial elements in the forgery were the seals.  In China, all
documents are made official by the stamps on them.  Wen was good at
calligraphy, and could carve in the style of official stamps.  He used
cakes of soap.  In one evening all three letters for the three of us,
which would have taken months to obtain, if we were lucky, were
ready.

Wen offered to go back to Ningnan with Nana and me to help with the
rest of the procedure.

When the time came to go, I was agorfizingly torn, because it meant
leaving my grandmother in the hospital.

She urged me to go, saying she would return home and keep an eye on my
younger brothers.  I did not try to dissuade her: the hospital was a
terribly depressing place.

Apart from the revolting smell, it was also incredibly noisy,

7b the Edge of the Himalaya~ 52, with moaning and clattering and loud
conversations in the corridors day and night.  Loudspeakers woke eve
none up at six in the morning, and there were often deaths in full view
of other patients.

On the evening she was discharged, my grandmother felt a sharp pain at
the base of her spine.  She could not sit on the luggage rack of the
bicycle, so Xiao-her rode it home with her clothes, towels, washbowls,
thermos flasks, and the cooking utensils, and I walked with her,
supporting her.  The evening was sultry.  Walking even very slowly hurt
her, as I could see from her tightly pursed lips and her trembling as
she tried to suppress her moans.  I told her stories and gossip to
divert her.  The plane trees that used to shade the pavements now
produced only a few pathetic branches with leaves on them they had not
been pruned in the three years of the Cultural Revolution.  Here and
there, buildings were scarred, the result of the fierce fighting
between R/~bel factions.

It took us nearly an hour to get halfway.  Suddenly the sky turned
dark.  A violent gale swept up the dust and the torn fragments of wall
posters.  My grandmother staggered.

I held her tight.  It started to pour with rain, and in an instant we
were drenched.  There was nowhere to take cover, so we struggled on.
Our clothes were clinging to us and impeding our movements.  I was
panting for breath.

My grandmother's tiny, thin figure felt heavier and heavier in my arms.
The rain was hissing and splashing, the wind slashed against our soaked
bodies, and I felt very cold.  My grandmother sobbed, "Oh heaven, let
me die!  Let me die!"

I wanted to cry too, but I only said, "Grandma, we'll soon be home ....
'

Then I heard a bell tinkling.

"Hey, do you want a lift?"

A pedal-cart had pulled over; a young man in an open shirt was
straddling it, rain running down his cheeks.  He came over and carried
my grandmother onto the open cart on which an old man was crouching. He
nodded to us.  The young man said this was his father whom he was
taking home from the hospital.  He dropped us at our door, waving off
my profuse thanks with a cheerful "No trouble at all," before
disappearing into the sodden darkness.  Because of the pressure of the
downpour, I never learned his name.

Two days later my grandmother was up and about in the kitchen, rolling
out dumpling wrappings to give us a treat.  She started to tidy up the
rooms, too, in her usual nonstop way.  I could see she was overdoing
things and asked her to stay in bed, but she would not listen.

By now it was the beginning of June.  She kept telling me I should
leave, and insisted that Jin-ming should go as well, to look after me,
since I had been so sick last time in Ningnan.  Though he had just
turned sixteen, Jin-ming had not yet been assigned a commune.  I sent a
telegram asking my sister to come back from Ningnan and look after our
grandmother.  Xiao-her, fourteen at the time, promised that he could be
depended on, and seven-year-old Xiao-fang solemnly made the same
announcement.

When I went to say goodbye to her, my grandmother wept.  She said she
did not know whether she would ever see me again.  I stroked the back
of her hand, which was now bony, with bulging veins, and pressed it to
my cheek.

I suppressed the surge of tears and said I would be back very soon.

After a long search, I had finally found a truck going to the Xichang
region.  Since the mid-1960s Mao had ordered many important factories
(including the one where my sister's boyfriend Specs worked) to be
moved to Sichuan, particularly to Xichang, where a new industrial base
was being built.  Mao's theory was that the mountains of Sichuan
provided the best deterrent in case the Americans or the Russians
attacked.  Trucks from five different provinces were busy delivering
goods to the base.  Through a friend, a driver from Peking agreed to
take us -Jin-ming, Nana, Wen, and me.  We had to sit on the back of the
open truck because the cabin was reserved for the relief

To the Edge of the Hirnalqyas 5' (~ driver.  Every truck belonged to a
convoy which met up in the evening.

These drivers had the reputation of being happy to take girls but not
boys much the same as their brotherhood the world over.  Since they
were almost the only source of transport, this angered some boys. Along
the way I sa~' slogans pasted on the trunks of trees: "Strongly protest
the truckers who only take females and not males!"  Some bolder boys
stood in the middle of the road to try to force the trucks to stop. 
One boy from my school did not manage to leap away in time and was
killed.

From the lucky female hitchhikers, there were a few reports of rape,
but many more of romance.  Quite a few marriages resulted from these
journeys.  A truck driver who took part in the construction of the
strategic base enjoyed certain privileges, one being the right to
transfer his wife's country registration to the city where he lived.
Some girls jumped at this opportunity.

Our drivers were very kind, and behaved impeccably.

When we stopped for the night, they would help us secure a hotel bed
before going to their guesthouse, and they would invite us to have
supper with them so we could share their special food, free.

Only once did I feel there was something faintly sexual on their minds.
At one stop another pair of drivers invited Nana and me to go on their
truck for the next leg.  When we told our driver, his face fell a mile,
and he said in a sulky voice, "Go ahead then, go ahead with those nice
guys of yours if you like them better."  Nana and I looked at each
other and mumbled in embarrassment, "We didn't say we liked them
better.  You are all very nice to us .... We did not go.

Wen kept an eye on Nana and me.  He constantly warned us about drivers,
about men in general, about thieves, about what to eat and what not to
eat, and about going out after dark.  He also carried our bags and
fetched hot water for us.  At dinnertime, he would tell Nana, Jin-ming,
and

53o "Thought Reform through Labor' me to join the drivers to eat while
he stayed behind in the hotel to look after our bags, as theft was
rampant.  We brought food back for him.

There was never any sexual advance from Wen.  On the evening we crossed
the border into Xichang, Nana and I wanted to wash in the river,
because the weather was so hot and the evening so beautiful.  Wen found
us a quiet bend in the river where we bathed in the company of wild
ducks and twirling reeds.  The rays of the moon were pouring onto the
river, the image scattering into masses of sparkling silver rings.  Wen
sat near the road with his back studiously to us, keeping guard.  Like
many other young men, he had been brought up in the pre-Cultural
Revolution days to be chivalrous.

To get into a hotel, we needed to produce a letter from our unit.  Wen,
Nana, and I had each secured a letter from our production teams in
Ningnan, and Jin-ming had a letter from his school.  The hotels were
inexpensive, but we did not have much money, since our parents'
salaries had been drastically reduced.  Nana and I would get a single
bed between us in a dormitory and the boys would do the same.  The
hotels were filthy, and very basic.  Before going to bed, Nana and I
would turn the quilt over and over looking for fleas and lice.  The
hotel washbowls usually had rings of dark-gray or yellow dirt on them.
Trachoma and fungal infections were commonplace, so we used our own.

One night we were awakened about twelve o'clock by loud bangs on the
door: everyone in the hotel had to get up to make an 'evening report'
to Chairman Mao.  This farcical activity was in the same package as the
'1oyaIty dances."  It involved gathering in front of a statue or
portrait of Mao, chanting quotations from the Litfie Red Book, and
shouting "Long live Chairman Mao, long long live Chairman Mao, and long
long long live Chairman Mao!"

while waving the Litfie Red Book rhythmically.

Half awake, Nana and I staggered out of our room.

To the Edge of the Himalayas 53 l Other travelers were emerging in twos
and threes, rubbing their eyes, buttoning their jackets, and pulling up
the cotton backs of their shoes.  There was not a single complaint.  No
one dared.  At five in the morning we had to go through the same thing
again.  This was called 'morning request for instructions' from Mao.
Later, when we were on our way, Jin-ming said, "The head of the
Revolutionary Committee in this town must be an insomniac."

Grotesque forms of worshipping Mao had been part of our lives for some
time chanting, wearing Mao badges, waving the Little Red Book.  But the
idolatry had escalated when the Revolutionary Committees were formally
established nationwide by late 1968.  The committee members reckoned
that the safest and most rewarding course of action was to do nothing,
except promote the worship of Mao and, of course, continue to engage in
political persecutions.  Once, in a pharmacy in Chengdu, an old shop
assistant with a pair of impassive eyes behind gray-rimmed spectacles
murmured without looking at me, "When sailing the seas we need a
helmsman..."  There was a pregnant pause.  It took me a moment to
realize I was supposed to complete the sentence, which was a fawning
quotation from Lin Biao about Mao.  Such exchanges had just been
enforced as a standard greeting.  I had to mumble, "When making
revolution we need Mao Zedong Thought."

Revolutionary Committees all over China ordered statues of Mao to be
built.  A huge white marble figure was planned for the center of
Chengdu.  To accommodate it, the elegant ancient palace gate, on which
I had stood so happily only a few years before, was dynamited.  The
white marble was to come from Xichang, and special trucks, called
'loyalty trucks," were shipping the marble out from the mountains.
These trucks were decorated like floats in a parade, festooned with red
silk ribbons and a huge silk flower in front.  They made the journey
from Chengdu empty, as they were devoted exclusively to carrying the
marble.  The trucks which supplied Xichang returned to

Chengdu empty: they were not allowed to sully the material that was
going to form Mao's body.

After we said goodbye to the driver who had brought us from Chengdu we
hitched a lift on one of these 'loyalty trucks' for the last stretch to
Ningnan.  On the way we stopped at a marble quarry for a rest.  A group
of sweating workers, naked to the waist, were drinking tea and smoking
their yard-long pipes.  One of them told us they were not using any
machinery, as only working with their bare hands could express their
loyalty to Mao.  I was horrified to see a badge of Mao pinned to his
bare chest.  When we were back in the truck, Jin-ming observed that the
badge might have been stuck on with a plaster.  And, as for their
devoted quarrying by hand: "They probably don't have any machines in
the first place."

Jin-ming often made skeptical comments like this which kept us
laughing.  This was unusual in those days, when humor was dangerous.
Mao, hypocritically calling for 'rebellion," wanted no genuine inquiry
or skepticism.  To be able to think in a skeptical way was my first
step toward enlightenment.  Like Bing, Jin-ming helped to destroy my
rigid habits of thinking.

As soon as we entered Ningnan, which was about 5,000 feet above sea
level, I was hit by stomach trouble again.  I vomited up everything I
had eaten and the world seemed to be spinning around me.  But we could
not afford to stop.

We had to get to our production teams and complete the rest of the
transfer procedure by 21 June.  Since Nana's team was nearer, we
decided to go there first.  It was a day's walk through wild mountains.
The summer torrents roared down ravines across which there were often
no bridges.  While Wen waded ahead to test the depth of the water,
Jin-ming carried me on his bony back.  Often we had to walk on goat
trails about two feet wide at the edges of cliffs with sheer drops of
thousands of feet.  Several of my school friends had been killed
walking home along them at night.  The sun was blazing down, and my
skin

To the Edge of the Himala3,a.~ 53.;

began to peel.  I became obsessed with thirst, and drank all the water
from everybody's water cans.  When we came to a gully, I threw myself
on the ground and gulped down the cool liquid.  Nana tried to stop me.
She said even the peasants would not drink this water unboiled.  But I
was too wild with thirst to care.  Of course, this was followed by more
violent vomiting.

Eventually we came to a house.  It had several gigantic chestnut trees
in front, stretching out their majestic canopies.  The peasants invited
us in.  I licked my cracked lips and immediately made for the stove
where I could see a big earthenware bowl, probably containing rice
fluid.  Here in the mountains this was considered the most delicious
drink, and the owner of the house kindly offered it to us.

Rice fluid is normally white, but what I saw was black.  A whine burst
out from it, and a mass of flies lifted off from the jellied surface. I
stared into the bowl and saw a few casualties drowning.  I had always
been very squeamish about flies, but now I picked up the bowl, flicked
aside the corpses, and downed the liquid in great gulps.

It was dark when we reached Nana's village.  The next day, her
production team leader was only too glad to stamp her three letters and
get rid of her.  In the last few months the peasants had learned that
what they had acquired were not extra hands, but extra mouths to feed.
They could not throw the city youths out, and were delighted when
anyone offered to leave.

I was too sick to go on to my own team, so Wen set off alone to try to
secure the release of my sister and myselfi Nana and the other girls in
her team tried their best to nurse me.  I ate and drank only things
which had been boiled and reboiled many times, but I lay there feeling
miserable, missing my grandmother and her chicken soup.

Chicken was considered a great delicacy in those days, and Nana joked
that I somehow managed to combine turmoil in my stomach with an
appetite for the best food.  Nevertheless, she and the other girls and
Jin-ming went all out to try to purchase a chicken.  But the local
peasants did not eat or sell chickens, which they raised only for eggs.
They put this custom down to their ancestors' rules, but we were told
by friends that chickens here were infested with leprosy, which was
widespread in these mountains.  So we shunned eggs as well.

Jin-ming was determined to make me some soup like my grandmother's, and
put his bent for inven6on to practical use.  On the open platform in
front of the house, he propped up a big round bamboo lid with a stick
and spread some grain underneath.  He tied a piece of string to the
stick and hid behind a door, holding the other end of the string, and
placed a mirror in such a position that he could monitor what went on
under the half-open lid.  Crowds of sparrows landed to fight for the
gram, and sometimes a turtledove swaggered in.  Jin-ming would choose
the best moment to pull the string and bring down the lid.  Thanks to
his ingenuity, I had delicious game soup.

The mountains at the back of the house were covered with peach trees
now bearing ripe fruit, and Jin-ming and the gifts came back every day
with baskets full of peaches.

Jin-ming said I must not eat them uncooked, and made me jam.

I felt pampered, and spent my days in the hall, gazing at the faraway
mountains and reading Turgenev and Chekhov, which Jin-ming had brought
for the journey.  I was deeply affected by the mood in Turgenev, and
learned many passages from First Love by heart.

In the evenings, the serpentine curve of some distant mountains burned
like a dramatic fire dragon silhouetted against the dark sky.  Xichang
had a very dry climate, and forest protection rules were not being
enforced, nor were the fire services working.  As a result, the
mountains were burning day after day, only stopping when a gorge
blocked the way, or a storm doused the flames.

After a few days Wen returned with the permission from my production
team for my sister and me to leave.  We set off immediately to find the
registrar, although I was still weak, and could walk only a few yards
before my eyes became dazzled by a mass of sparkling stars.  There was
only a week left before 2I June.

We reached the county town of Ningnan, and found the atmosphere there
like wartime.  In most pans of China heavy factional fighting had
stopped by now, but in remote areas like this local battles continued.
The losing side was hiding in the mountains, and had been launching
frequent lightning attacks.  There were armed guards everywhere, mostly
members of an ethnic group, the Yi, a lot of whom lived in the deeper
recesses of the Xichang wilderness.

Legend had it that when they slept, the Yi did not lie down, but
squatted, burying their heads in the folds of their arms.

The faction leaders, who were all Han, talked them into doing the
dangerous jobs like fighting in the front line and keeping guard.  As
we searched the county offices for the registrar, we often had to
engage in long, involved explanations with the Yi guards, using hand
gestures, as we had no language in common.  When we approached, they
lifted their guns and aimed them at us, their fingers on the triggers,
and their left eyes narrowed.  We were scared to death, but had to look
nonchalant.  We had been advised that they would regard any
demonstration of fear as a sign of guilt, and react accordingly.

We finally found the registrar's office, but he was not there.  Then we
bumped into a friend who told us that he had gone into hiding because
of the hordes of city youth besieging him to sort out their problems.
Our friend did not know where the registrar was, but he told us about a
group of 'old city youth' who might.

"Old city youth' were ones who had gone to the countryside before the
Cultural Revolution.  The Party had been trying to persuade those who
had failed exams for high schools and universities to go and 'build a
splendid new socialist countryside' which would benefit from their
education.  In their romanic enthusiasm, a number of young

536 "Thought Rearm through Labor' people followed the Party's call. The
harsh reality of rural life, with no chance to escape, and the
realiTation of the regime's hypocrisy because no officials' children
ever went, even if they had failed their exams had turned many of them
into cynics.

This group of 'old city youth' was very friendly.  They gave us an
excellent meal of game and offered to find out where the registrar was.
While a couple of them went to look for him, we chatted with the
others, sitting on their spacious pine veranda facing a roaring fiver
called the Black Water.  On the high rocks above, egrets were balancing
on one long slender leg, raising the other in various balletic
postures.  Others were flying, fanning their gorgeous snow-white wings
with panache.  I had never seen these stylish dancers wild and free.

Our hosts pointed out a dark cave across the river.  From its ceiling
hung a rusty-looking bronze sword.  The cave was inaccessible because
it was right next to the turbulent river.  Legend had it that the sword
had been left there by the famous, wise prime minister of the ancient
kingdom of Sichuan, Marquis Zhuge Liang, in the third century.  He had
led seven expeditions from Chengdu to try to conquer the barbarian
tribes here in the Xichang area.  I knew the story well, and was
thrilled to see evidence of it before my eyes.  He captured the
chieftain of the tribes seven times, and each time he released him,
hoping to win him over by his magnanimity.  Six times, the Chieftain
was unmoved and continued his rebellion, but after the seventh time he
became wholeheartedly loyal to the Sichuanese king.  The moral of this
legend was that to conquer a people, one must conquer their hearts and
minds a strategy to which Mao and the Communists subscribed.  I vaguely
mused that this was why we had to go through 'thought reform' so that
we would follow orders willingly.  That was why peasants were set up as
models: they were the most unquestioning and submissive subjects.  On
reflection today, I think the variant of Nixon's adviser Charles Colson
spelled out the hidden agenda: When you have them by the balls, their
hearts and minds will follow.

My train of thought was interrupted by our hosts.  What we should do,
they enthusiastically advised, was drop a hint to the registrar about
our fathers' positions.

"He will slap the seal on in no time," declared one jolly-looking young
man.  They knew we were high officials' children because of the
reputation of my school.  I felt dubious about their advice.

"But our parents no longer hold these positions.

They have been labeled capitalist-roaders," I pointed out hesitantly.

"What does that matter?"  Several voices brushed aside my worry.

"Your father is a Communist veteran, right?"

"Right," I murmured.

"A high official, right?"

"Sort of," I mumbled.

"But that was before the Cultural Revolution.  Now..."

"Never mind that.  Has anyone announced his dismissal?

No?  That's all right, then.  You see, it's as clear as daylight that
the mandate of Party officials is not over.  He will tell you that' the
jolly young man pointed in the direction of the sword of the wise old
prime minister.  I did not realize at the time that, consciously or
subconsciously, people regarded Mao's personal power structure as no
alternative to the old Communist administration.  The ousted officials
would come back.  Meanwhile, the jolly young man was continuing,
shaking his head for emphasis: "No official here would dare to offend
you and create problems for himself in the future."  I thought of the
appalling vendettas of the Tings.  Of course, people in China would
always be alert to the possibility of revenge by those with power.

As we left, I asked how I should drop the hint to the registrar about
my father's position without sounding vulgar.  They laughed heartily.

"He is just like a peasant!  They don't have that kind of sensibility.
They won't be able to tell the difference anyway.  Just tell him
straight out: "My father is the head of"' I was struck by the scornful
tone

538 "Thought ReJbrrn through Labor' in their voices.  Later I
discovered that most city youth, old or new, developed a strong
contempt for the peasants after they had set fled down among them. 
Mao, of course, had expected the opposite reaction.

On 2o June, after days of desperately searching the mountains, we found
the registrar.  My rehearsal of how to drop the hint about my parents'
positions proved completely unnecessary.  The registrar himself took
the initiative by asking me: "What did your father do before the
Cultural Revolution?"  After many personal questions, put from
curiosity rather than necessity, he took a dirty handkerchief out of
his jacket pocket and unfolded it to reveal a wooden seal and a flat
fin box containing a sponge in red ink.  Solemnly he pressed the seal
into the sponge and then stamped our letters.

With that vital seal and by the skin of our teeth with less than
twenty-four hours to spare we had accomplished our mission.  We still
had to find the clerk in charge of our registration books, but we knew
that that was not going to be a big problem.  The authorization had
been obtained.  I relaxed immediately into stomach pains and
diarrhea.

I struggled back with the others to the county town.  It was dark by
the time we arrived.  We made for the government guesthouse, a drab
two-story building standing in the middle of a walled enclosure.  The
porter's lodge was empty, and there was no one visible on the grounds
either.

Most of the rooms were shut, but on the top floor some bedroom doors
were half open.

I entered one, after making sure there was no one in it.  An open
window looked out on some fields beyond a dilapidated brick wall.
Across the corridor was another row of rooms.  There was not a soul
around.  From some personal things in the room and a half-drunk mug of
tea, I gathered that someone had been staying here very recently.

But I was too tired to wonder why he or she and everyone else had
deserted the building.  Without even the energy to close the door, I
threw myself onto the bed and fell asleep fully dressed.

I was jolted awake by a loudspeaker chanting some quo~ tafions by Mao,
one being: "If the enemy won't surrender, we will eliminate them!"  I
was suddenly wide awake.  I realized our building was under attack.

The next thing I heard was the whine of bullets very close by, and
windows breaking.  The loudspeaker yelled out the name of some Rebel
organization, urging it to surrender.  Otherwise, it screeched, the
attackers would dynamite the building.

Jin-ming burst in.  Several armed men wearing rattan helmets were
rushing into the rooms opposite mine, which overlooked the front gate.
One of them was a young boy shouldering a gun taller than himself.
Without a word, they raced to the windows, smashed the glass with the
butts of their rifles, and started shooting.  A man who seemed to be
their commander told us hurriedly that the building had been the
headquarters of his faction, and was now being attacked by the
opposition.  We had better get out quickly but not down the stairs,
which led to the front.  How then?

We frantically tore the sheets and quilt covers off the bed and made a
sort of rope.  We fled one end of it to a window frame and scrambled
down the two stories.  As we landed, bullets whistled and hissed into
the hard mud around us.  We bent double and ran for the collapsed
wall.

Once over it, we kept running for a long time before we felt safe
enough to stop.  The sky and the maize fields were beginning to show
their pale features.  We made for a friend's place in a nearby commune
to catch our breath and decide what to do next.  On the way, we heard
from some peasants that the guesthouse had been blown up.

At our friend's place, a message was waiting for me.  A telegram from
my sister in Chengdu had arrived just after we had left Nana's village
in search of the registrar.  As no one knew where I was, my friends had
opened it and passed

54o "Thought ReJbrm through Labor' the message around so that whoever
saw me could let me know.

This was how I learned that my grandmother was dead.

23.  "The More Books You Read, the More Stupid You Become'B I Work as a
Peasant and a Barefoot Doctor

(lune 1969-1971)

Jin-ming and I sat on the bank of the Golden Sand River, waiting for a
ferry.  I rested my head on my hands and stared at the unruly river
tumbling past me on its long journey from the Himalayas to the sea.  It
was to become the longest fiver in China the Yangtze, after joining the
Min River at Yibin, 300 miles downstream.

Toward the end of its journey, the Yangtze spreads and meanders,
irrigating vast areas of flat farmland.  But here, in the mountains, it
was too violent to build a bridge across it.  Only ferries linked
Sichuan province with Yunnan to the east.  Every summer, when the
torrent was high and fierce with the melted snow, the river claimed
lives.  Just a few days before, it had swallowed a ferry with three of
my schoolmates in it.

Dusk was descending.  I felt very ill.  Jin-ming had spread his jacket
on the ground for me so I would not have to sit on the damp grass.  Our
aim was to cross over to Yunnan and try to hitch a lift to Chengdu. The
roads through Xichang were cut off by fighting between Rebel factions,
so we had to try a roundabout route.  Nana and Wen had offered to get
my registration book and luggage, and those of Xiao-hong, to Chengdu.

A dozen strong men rowed the ferry against the current, chanting a song
in unison.  When they reached the middle of the river, they stopped and
let the ferry be carried downstream toward the Yunnan side.  Huge waves
broke over us several times.  I had to hold on tight to the side while
the boat listed helplessly.  Normally I would have been terrified, but
now I felt only numbness.  I was too preoccupied with the death of my
grandmother.

A solitary truck stood on a basketball court in the town on the Yunnan
bank, Qjaojia.  The driver readily agreed to give us a lift in the
back.  All the time, I kept turning over in my head what I could have
done to save my grandmother.  As the truck jolted along, we passed
banana groves at the back of mud houses in the embrace of cloud-capped
mountains.  Seeing the gigantic banana leaves, I remembered the small,
potted, fruitless banana by the door of my grandmother's hospital ward
in Chengdu.  When Bing came to see me, I used to sit beside it with
him, chatting deep into the night.  My grandmother did not like him
because of his cynical grin and the casualness with which he treated
adults, which she considered disrespectful.  Twice she came staggering
downstairs to call me back.

I had hated myself for making her anxious, but I could not help it.  I
could not control my desire to see Bing.  Now how I wished I could
start all over again!  I would not do anything to upset her.  I would
just make sure she got better although how I did not know.

We passed through Yibin.  The road wound down Emerald Screen Hill on
the edge of the city.  Staring at the elegant redwoods and bamboo
groves, I thought back to April, when I had just returned home to
Meteorite Street from Yibin.  I was telling my grandmother how I had
gone

I Work as a Peasant and a Barefoot Doctor 543 to sweep Dr.  Xia's tomb,
which was on the side of this hill, on a sunny spring day.  Aunt
Jun-ying had given me some special 'silver money' to burn at the tomb.
God knows where she had got it from, as it had been condemned as
'feudal."  I searched up and down for hours, but could not find the
tomb.  The hillside was a battered mess.  The Red Guards had leveled
the cemetery and smashed the tombstones, as they considered burial an
'old' practice.  I can never forget the intense flame of hope in my
grandmother's eyes when I mentioned the visit, and how it darkened
almost immediately when I stupidly added that the tomb was lost.  Her
look of disappointment had been haunting me.  Now I kicked myself for
not telling her a white lie.

But it was too late.

When Jin-ming and I got home, after more than a week on the road, there
was only her empty bed.  I remembered seeing her stretched out on it,
her hair loose but still tidy, biting her lips hard, her cheeks sunken.
She had suffered her murderous pains in silence and composure, never
screaming, never writhing.  Because of her stoicism, I had failed to
realize how serious her illness was.

My mother was in detention.  What Xiao-her and Xiaohong told me about
Grandmother's last days caused me such anguish that I had to ask them
to stop.  It was only years later that I learned what had happened
after I left.

She would do some housework, then go back to bed and lie there with her
face taut, trying to fight back the pain.

She constantly murmured that she was anxious about my trip, and worried
about my younger brothers.

"What will become of the boys, with no schools?"  she would sigh.

Then one day she could not get out of bed.  No doctor would come to the
house, so my sister's boyfriend, Specs, carried her to the hospital on
his back.  My sister walked by his side, propping her up.  After a
couple of journeys, the doctors asked them not to come anymore.  They
said they could find nothing wrong with her and there was nothing they
could do.

So she lay in bed, waiting for death.  Her body became lifeless bit by
bit.  Her lips moved from time to time, but my sister and brothers
could hear nothing.  Many times they went to my mother's place of
detention to beg for her to be permitted to come home.  Each time, they
were turned away without being able to see her.

My grandmother's entire body seemed to be dead.  But her eyes were
still open, looking around expectantly.  She would not close them until
she had seen her daughter.

At last my mother was allowed home.  Over the next two days, she did
not leave my grandmother's bedside.  Every now and then, my grandmother
would whisper something to her.  Her last words were about how she had
fallen into this pain.

She said the neighbors belonging to Mrs.  Shau's group had held a
denunciation meeting against her in the courtyard.  The receipt for the
jewelry she had donated during the Korean War had been confiscated by
some Rebels in a house raid.  They said she was 'a stinking member of
the exploiting class," otherwise how could she have acquired all that
jewelry in the first place?

My grandmother said she had had to stand on a small table.  The ground
was uneven and the table wobbled, and she felt dizzy.  The neighbors
were yelling at her.  The woman who had accused Xiao-fang of raping her
daughter hit one leg of the table ferociously with a club.  My
grandmother could not keep her balance and fell backwards onto the hard
ground.  She said she had felt a sharp pain ever since.

In fact, there had been no denunciation meeting.  But that was the
image that haunted my grandmother to her last breath.

On the third day after my mother came home, my grandmother died.  Two
days later, immediately after my grandmother was cremated, my mother
had to return to detention.

I have often dreamed of my grandmother since, and

I Work as a Peasant and a Barqbot Doctor 545 awakened sobbing.  She was
a great character vivacious, talented, and immensely capable.  Yet she
had no outlet for her abilities.  The daughter of an ambitious
small-town policeman, concubine to a warlord, stepmother to an extended
but divided family, and mother and mother-inlaw to two Communist
officials in all these circumstances she had little happiness.  The
days with Dr.  Xia were lived under the shadow of their past, and
together they endured poverty, Japanese occupation, and the civil war.
She might have found happiness in looking after her grandchildren, but
she was rarely free from anxiety about us.  Most of her life she had
lived in fear, and she faced death many times.

She was a strong woman, but in the end the disasters which hit my
parents, the worries about her grandchildren, the tide of ugly human
hostility all conspired to crush her.

But the most unbearable thing for her was what happened to her
daughter.  It was as though she felt in her own body and soul every bit
of the pain that my mother suffered, and she was finally killed by the
accumulation of anguish.

There was another, more immediate factor in her death:

she was denied proper medical care and could not be looked after, or
even seen, by her daughter when she was fatally ill.  Because of the
Cultural Revolution.  How could the revolution be good, I asked myself,
when it brought such human destruction, for nothing?  Over and over
again, I told myself I hated the Cultural Revolution, and I felt even
worse because there was nothing I could do.

I blamed myself for not looking after my grandmother as well as I might
have.  She was in the hospital at the time when I had come to know Bing
and Wen.  My friendships with them had cushioned and insulated me, and
had blunted my awareness of her suffering.  I told myself it was
despicable to have had any happy feelings at all, by the side of what
I'now realized was my grandmother's deathbed.  I resolved never to have
a boyfriend again.  Only by self denial I thought, could I expiate some
of my guilt.

The next two months I stayed in Chengdu, desperately looking, with Nana
and my sister, for a 'relative' nearby whose commune would accept us.
We had to find one by the end of the autumn harvest when food was
distributed, otherwise we would have nothing to eat for the following
year our state supply ran out in January.

When Bing came to see me, I was very cold to him, and told him never to
come again.  He wrote me letters but I threw them into the stove
without opening them- a gesture I had perhaps picked up from Russian
novels.  Wen came back from Ningnan with my registration book and
luggage, but I refused to see him.  Once I passed him on the street,
and looked straight through him, catching only a glimpse of his eyes,
in which I saw confusion and hurt.

Wen returned to Ningnan.  One summer day in 197o, a forest fire broke
out near his village.  He and a friend rushed out with a couple of
brooms to try to put it out.  A gust of wind threw a ball of flames
into his friend's face, leaving him permanently disfigured.  The two of
them left Ningnan and crossed into Laos, where there was a war going on
between left-wing guerrillas and the United States.  At the time a
number of high officials' children were going to Laos and Vietnam to
fight the Americans secretly, as it was forbidden by the government.
These young people had become disillusioned with the Cultural
Revolution, and hoped they could get back their youthful adrenaline by
taking on the "US imperialists."

One day soon after they got to Laos, Wen heard the alarm which signaled
that American planes were coming.

He was the first to leap up and charge out, but in his inexperience he
stepped on a mine which his comrades had planted themselves.  He was
blown to smithereens.  My last memory of him is his perplexed and
wounded eyes watching me from a muddy street corner in Chengdu.

Meanwhile, my family was scattered.  On I7 October 1969 Lin Biao
ordered the country into a state of war, using as a pretext clashes
which had broken out earlier that year on

I Work as a Peasant and a Baredhot Doctor 547 the border with the
Soviet Union.  In the name of 'evacuation," he sent his opponents in
the army and the disgraced top leaders out of the capital and placed
them under house arrest or detention in different parts of China.  The
Revolutionary Committees used this opportunity to speed up the
deportation of 'undesirables."  The 500 members of my mother's Eastern
District staff were ordered out of Chengdu to a place in the Xichang
hinterland called Buffalo Boy Flatland.  My mother was allowed ten days
at home from detention to make arrangements.  She put Xiao-her and
Xiao-fang on a train to Yibin.  Although Aunt Jun-ying was
half-paralyzed, there were other aunts and uncles there who could look
after them.  Jin-ming had been sent by his school to a commune fifty
miles northeast of Chengdu.

At the same time Nana, my sister, and I finally found a commune that
would take us in a county called Deyang, not far from where Jin-ming
was.  Specs, my sister's boyfriend, had a colleague from the county who
was prepared to claim we were his cousins.  Some communes in the area
needed more farmhands.  Although we had no proof of kinship, no one
asked any questions.  The only thing that mattered was that we were or
at least seemed to be extra labor.

We were allocated to two different production teams, because two extra
people was the maximum any one team could accommodate.  Nana and I went
to one team and my sister to another, three miles away.  The railway
station was about five hours' walk away, much of it along eighteen
inch-wide ridges between rice paddies.

My family of seven was now dispersed in six different places.  Xiao-her
was happy to leave Chengdu, where the new Chinese-language textbook at
his school, compiled by some teachers and members of the propaganda
team there, contained a condemnation of my father by name, and Xiaohei
was ostracized and bullied.

In the early summer of 1969, his school had been sent to the
countryside on the outskirts of Chengdu to help with the harvest.  The
boys and girls camped separately in two large halls.  In the evenings,
under the starry vault of the sky, the paths between the paddy fields
were frequented by young couples.  Romance bloomed, not least in the
heart of my fourteen-year-old brother, who started to fancy a girl in
his group.  After days of summoning up his courage, he nervously
approached her one afternoon when they were cutting wheat, and invited
her to go for a walk that evening.  The girl bent her head and said
nothing.  Xiao-her thought this was a sign of 'silent consent,"
mo-xu.

He leaned on a haystack in the moonlight, and waited with all the
anxieties and longings of first love.  Suddenly, he heard a whistle.  A
gang of boys from his form appeared.

They shoved him around and called him names, then they threw a jacket
over his head and started to hit and kick him.  He managed to break
free, and staggered to the door of one of the teachers and shouted for
help.  The teacher opened the door, but pushed him away, saying, "I
can't help you!  Don't you dare come back!"

Xiao-her was too frightened to return to his camp, and spent the night
hiding in a haystack.  He realized it was his 'sweetheart' who had
called in the bullies: she had felt insulted that the son of a
'counterrevolutionary capitalistroader' should have the audacity to
fancy her.

When they returned to Chengdu, Xiao-her went to his street gang for
help.  They appeared at his school with much flaunting of muscles, and
a gigantic wolfhound, and hauled the leading bully out of the
classroom.  He was shaking, his face ashen.  But before the gang set
upon him, Xiao-her was overtaken by pity, and asked his helmsman to let
the boy go.

Pity had become an alien concept, and was seen as a sign of stupidity.
Xiao-her was bullied even more than before.  He made a feeble attempt
at enlisting the help of his gang again, but they told him they would
not help a 'shrimp."

Xiao-her approached his new school in Yibin dreading more bullying.  To
his amazement, he received a warm.

almost emotional welcome.  The teachers, the propaganda team members
who were running the school, the children all seemed to have heard of
my father and referred to him with open admiration.  Xiao-her
immediately acquired a certain prestige.  The prettiest girl in the
school became his girlfriend.  Even the most thuggish boys treated him
with respect.  It was clear to him that my father was a revered figure
in Yibin, in spite of the fact that everyone knew he was in disgrace,
and the Tings were in power.

The population of Yibin had suffered horribly under the Tings.
Thousands had died or been injured in the factional fighting or under
torture.  One family friend escaped death because when his children
went to collect his corpse in the morgue, they found he was still
breathing.

People in Yibin had developed a great yearning for the days of peace,
for officials who did not abuse their power, for a government that was
dedicated to getting things to work.  The focus of this nostalgia was
the early 195os, when my father was the governor.  It was then that the
Communists were at their most popular just after they had replaced the
Kuomintang, put an end to starvation, and established law and order,
but before their incessant political campaigns (and their own,
Mao-induced famine).

My father became identified in the folk memory with the good old days.
He was seen as the legendary good official, in stark contrast with the
Tings.

Because of him, Xiao-her enjoyed his stay in Yibin although he learned
lit He at school.  Teaching materials still consisted of Mao's works
and People's Daily articles, and no one had any authority over the
pupils since Mao had not retracted his blanket dismissal of formal
learning.

The teachers and the workers' propaganda team tried to enlist
Xiao-her's help to enforce discipline in his class.

But here even my father's reputation failed, and Xiao-her was
eventually ostracized by some of the boys for being the teacher's
'lackey."  A whispering campaign began claiming that he had embraced
his girlfriend under lampposts in the street, which was a 'bourgeois
crime."  Xiao-her lost his privileged position and was told to write
self-criticisms and to pledge to carry out thought reform.  The girl's
mother turned up one day insisting on a surgical examination to prove
her daughter's chastity.  After a big scene, she took her daughter out
of the school.

Xiao-her had one close friend in his class, a popular boy of seventeen
who had one sensitive spot: his mother had never married, but had five
children all with different and unknown fathers, which was extremely
unusual in a society where 'illegitimacy' was heavily stigmatized, in
spite of having been formally abolished.  Now, in one of the
witch-hunting tides, she was publicly humiliated as a 'bad element."
The boy felt very ashamed of his mother, and told Xiao-her in private
that he hated her.  One day the school was awarding a best-swimmer
prize (because Mao liked swimming), and Xiao-her's friend was
unanimously nominated by the pupils; but when the award was announced,
it was not to him.  Apparently one young woman teacher had objected:
"We can't give it to him: his mother is a "worn shoe."

When the boy heard this, he grabbed a kitchen chopper and stormed into
the teacher's office.  Someone stopped him while the teacher scuttled
off and hid.  Xiao-her knew how much this incident had hurt his friend:
for the first time, the boy was seen weeping bitterly.  That night,
Xiaohei and some of the other boys sat up with him, trying to comfort
him.  The next day, he disappeared.  His corpse was washed up on the
bank of the Golden Sand River.  He had tied his hands together before
he jumped.

The Cultural Revolution not only did nothing to modernize the medieval
elements in China's culture, it actually gave them political
respectability.

"Modern' dictatorship and ancient intolerance fed on each other.  Any
one who fell foul of the age-old conservative attitude, could now
become a political victim.

My new commune in Deyang was in an area of low hills dotted with shrubs
and eucalyptus trees.  Most of the farmland was good, producing two
major harvests a year, one of wheat and one of rice.  Vegetables,
rapeseed, and sweet potatoes grew in abundance.  After Ningnan, the
biggest relief for me was that we did not have to do any climbing, and
I could breathe normally instead of panting for breath all the time.  I
did not mind the fact that walking here meant staggering along narrow,
muddy ridges between paddy fields.  I often fell on my bottom, and
sometimes in a grab for support I would push the person in front
usually Nana into a rice paddy.  Nor did I mind another peril of
walking at night: the possibility of being bitten by dogs, quite a few
of which had rabies.

When we first arrived, we stayed next to a pigsty.  At night, we fell
asleep to a symphony of pigs grunting, mosquitoes whining, and dogs
barking.  The room smelled permanently of pig manure and anti-mosquito
incense.  After a while the production team built Nana and me a
two-room cottage on a plot of land which had been used for cutting mud
bricks.  The land was lower than the rice paddy which lay just across a
narrow footpath, and in spring and summer, when the paddy He Ids were
filled with water, or after heavy rain, marshy water would ooze up from
the mud floor.  Nana and I had to take off our shoes, roll up our
trouser legs, and wade into the cottage.  Fortunately the double bed we
shared had tall legs, so we slept about two feet above the muddy water.
Getting into bed involved putting a bowl of clean water on a stool,
climbing up onto the stool, and washing our feet.  Living in these damp
conditions, my bones and muscles ached all the time.

But the cottage was also fun.  When the flood receded, mushrooms would
spring up under the bed and in the corners of the rooms.  With a little
imagination, the floor
looked like something out of a fairy tale.  Once I dropped a spoonful
of peas on the ground.  After the water had come and gone, a cluster of
delicate petals unfolded from slender stems, as though they had just
awakened to the rays of the sun, which brimmed through the wood-framed
opening in the wall which was our window.

The view was perpetually magical to me.  Beyond our door lay the
village pond, overgrown with water lilies and lotuses.  The path in
front of the cottage led up to a pass in the hill about 35o feet above
us.  The sun set behind it, framed by black rocks.  Before darkness
fell, silver mist would hang over the fields at the foot of the hills.
Men, women, and children walked back to the village after their day's
work in the evening haze, carrying baskets, hoes, and sickles, and were
met by their dogs who yapped and leaped about them.  They looked as
though they were sailing in clouds.  Smoke curved out from the thatched
cottages.

Wooden barrels clicked at the stone well, as people fetched water for
the evening meal.  Loud voices were heard as people chatted by the
bamboo groves, the men squatting and puffing their long, slender pipes.
Women neither smoked nor squatted: these were traditionally considered
unbecoming for women, and no one in 'revolutionary' China had talked
about changing these attitudes.

It was in Deyang that I came to know how China's peasants really lived.
Each day started with the production team leader allocating jobs.  All
the peasants had to work, and they each earned a fixed number of' work
points' gong fen for their day's work.  The number of work points
accumulated was an important element in the distribution at the end of
the year.  The peasants got food, fuel, and other daily necessities,
plus a tiny sum of cash, from the production team.  After the harvest,
the production team paid part of it over as tax to the state.  Then the
rest was divided up.  First, a basic quantity was meted out equally to
every male, and about a quarter less to every female.

Children under three received a half portion.  Since a child just over
three obviously could not eat an adult's share, iT was desirable to
have more children.  The system functioned as a positive disincentive
to birth control.

The remainder of the crop was then distributed according to how many
work points each person had earned.

Twice a year, the peasants would all assemble to fix the daily work
points for each person.  No one missed these meetings.  In the end,
most young and middle-aged men would be allocated ten points a day, and
women eight.

One or two whom the whole village acknowledged to be exceptionally
strong got an extra point.

"Class enemies' like the former village landlord and his family got a
couple of points less than the others, in spite of the fact that they
worked no less hard and were usually given the toughest jobs.  Nana and
I, being inexperienced 'city youth," got four the same number as
children barely in their teens; we were told this was 'to start with,"
though mine were never raised.

Since there was little variation from individual to individual of the
same gender in terms of daily points, the number of work points
accumulated depended mainly on how many days one worked, rather than
how one worked.

This was a constant source of resentment among the villagers in
addition to being a massive discouragement to efficiency.  Every day,
the peasants would screw up their eyes to watch how the others were
working in case they themselves were being taken advantage of.  No one
wanted to work harder than others who earned the same number of work
points.  Women felt bitter about men who sometimes did the same kind of
job as they, but earned two points more.  There were constant
arguments.

We frequently spent ten hours in the fields doing a job which could
have been done in five.  But we had to be out there for ten hours for
it to be counted as a full day.  We worked in slow motion, and I stared
at the sun impatiently willing it to go down, and counted the minutes
until the whistle blew, signaling an end to work.  I soon discovered
that boredom was as exhausting as backbreaking labor.

Here, as in Ningnan, and much of Sichuan, there were no machines at
all.  Farming methods were more or less the same as 2,000 years ago,
except for some chemical fertilizers, which the team received from the
government in exchange for grain.  There were practically no work
animals except water buffaloes for plowing.  Everything else, including
the transport of water, manure, fuel, vegetables, and grain, was done
entirely by hand, and shoulders, using bamboo baskets or wooden barrels
on a shoulder pole.  My biggest problem was carrying loads.  My right
shoulder was perpetually swollen and sore from having to carry water
from the well to the house.  Whenever a young man who fancied me came
to visit I displayed such helplessness that he never failed to offer to
fill the water tank for me.  And not only the water tank jugs, bowls,
and even cups too.

The team leader considerately stopped assigning me to carry things, and
sent me to do 'light' jobs with the children and the older and pregnant
women.  But they were not always light to me.  Ladling out manure soon
made my arms sore, not to mention churning up my stomach when I saw the
fat maggots swimming on the surface.  Picking cotton in a sea of
brilliant whiteness might have made an idyllic picture, but I quickly
realized how demanding it was directly under the relentless sun, in
temperatures well over 85 F, with high humidity, among prickly branches
that left scratches all over me.

I preferred transplanting rice shoots.  This was considered a hard job
because one had to bend so much.

Often at the end of the day, even the toughest men complained about not
being able to stand up straight.  But I loved the cool water on my legs
in the otherwise unbearable heat, the sight of the neat rows of tender
green, and the soft mud under my bare feet, which gave me a sensuous
pleasure.  The only thing that really bothered me was the leeches.  My
first encounter was when I felt something

[ Work as a Peasant and a BareJ3of Doctor 555 ticklish on my leg.  I
lifted it to scratch and saw a fat, slithery creature bending its head
into my skin, busily trying to squeeze in.  I let out a mighty scream.
A peasant girl next to me giggled.  She found my squeamishness funny.
Nevertheless, she trudged over and slapped my leg just above the leech.
It fell into the water with a plop.

On winter mornings, in the two-hour work period before breakfast, I
climbed up the hills with the 'weaker' women to collect firewood. There
were scarcely any trees on the hills, and even the bushes were few and
far between.  We often had to walk a long way.  We cut with a sickle,
grabbing the plants with our free hand.  The shrubs were covered with
thorns, quite a few of which would always manage to embed themselves in
my left palm and wrist.  At first I spent a long time trying to pick
them out, but eventually I got used to leaving them to come out on
their own, after the spots became inflamed.

We gathered what the peasants called 'feather fuel."  This was pretty
useless, and burned up in no time.  Once I voiced my regret about the
lack of proper trees.  The women with me said it had not always been
like this.  Before the Great Leap Forward, they told me, the hills had
been covered with pine, eucalyptus, and cypress.  They had all been
felled to feed the 'backyard furnaces' to produce steel.  The women
told me this placidly, with no bitterness, as though it were not the
cause of their daily battle for fuel.  They seemed to treat it as
something which life had thrust on them, like many other misfortunes. I
was shocked to come face-to-face, for the first time, with the
disastrous consequences of the Great Leap, which I had known only as a
'glorious success."

I found out a lot of other things.  A 'speak-bitterness' session was
organized for the peasants to describe how they had suffered under the
Kuomintang, and to generate gratitude to Mao, particularly among the
younger generation.  Some peasants talked about childhoods of
unrelieved hunger, and lamented that their own children were so spoiled
that they often had to be coaxed to finish their food.

Then their conversation turned to a particular famine.

They described having to eat sweet potato leaves and digging into the
ridges between the fields in the hope of finding some roots.  They
mentioned the many deaths in the village.  Their stories reduced me to
tears.  After saying how they hated the Kuomintang and how they loved
Chairman Mao, the peasants referred to this famine as taking place at
'the time of forming the communes."  Suddenly it struck me that the
famine they were talking about was under the Communists.  They had
confused the two regimes.  I asked:

"Were there unprecedented natural calamities in this period?  Wasn't
that the cause of the problem?"

"Oh no," they said.

"The weather could not have been better and there was plenty of grain
in the fields.  But that man' they pointed to a cringing forty-year-old
'ordered the men away to make steel, and half the harvest was lost in
the fields.  But he told us: no matter, we were in the paradise of
Communism now and did not have to worry about food.

Before, we had always had to control our stomachs, but then we ate our
fill in the commune canteen; we threw away the leftovers; we even fed
the pigs with precious rice.

Then the canteen had no more food, but he placed guards outside the
store.  The rest of the grain was to be shipped to Peking and Shanghai
there were foreigners there."

Bit by bit, the full picture came out.  The cringing man had been the
leader of the production team during the Great Leap.  He and his
cronies had smashed the peasants' woks and stoves so they could not
cook at home, and so the woks could be fed into the furnaces.  He had
reported vastly exaggerated harvests, with the result that the taxes
were so high they took every morsel of grain the peasants had left. The
villagers had died in scores.  After the famine, he was blamed for all
the wrongs in the village.  The commune allowed the villagers to vote
him out of office, and labeled him a 'class enemy."

4~

I Work as a Peasant and a Barefoot Da;'or 557 Like most class enemies,
he was not put in prison but kept 'under surveillance' by his fellow
villagers.  This was Mao's way: to keep 'enemy' figures among the
people so they always had someone visible and at hand to hate. Whenever
a new campaign came along, this man would be one of the 'usual
suspects' to be rounded up and attacked atYesh.  He was always assigned
the hardest jobs, and was allocated only seven work points a day, three
fewer than most of the other men.  I never saw anyone talking to him.
Several times I spotted village children throwing stones at his sons.

The peasants thanked Chairman Mao for punishing him.  No one questioned
his guilt, or the degree of his responsibility.  I sought him out, on
my own, and asked him his story.

He seemed pathetically grateful to be asked.

"I was carrying out orders," he kept saying.

"I had to carry out orders .... Then he sighed: "Of course, I didn't
want to lose my post.  Somebody else would have taken my place.

Then what would have happened to me and my kids?  We probably would
have died of hunger.  A production team leader is small, but at least
he can die after everyone else in the village."

His words and the peasants' stories shook me to the core.  It was the
first time I had come across the ugly side of Communist China before
the Cultural Revolution.  The picture was vastly different from the
rosy official version.

In the hills and fields of Deyang my doubts about the Communist regime
deepened.

I have sometimes wondered whether Mao knew what he was doing putting
the sheltered urban youth of China in touch with reality.  But then he
was confident that much of the population would not be able to make
rational deductions with the fragmentary information available to
them.

Indeed, at the age of eighteen I was still only capable of vague
doubts, not explicit analysis of the regime.  No matter how much I
hated the Cultural Revolution, to doubt Mao still did not enter my
mind.

In Deyang, as in Ningnan, few peasants could read the simplest article
in a newspaper or write a rudimentary letter.  Many could not even
write their own name.  The Communists' early drive to tackle illiteracy
had been pushed aside by incessant witch-hunts.  There had once been an
elementary school in the village, subsidized by the commune, but at the
beginning of the Cultural Revolution the children abused the teacher to
their hearts' content.

They paraded him around the village with heavy cast-iron woks piled up
on his head and his face blackened with soot.  Once they almost
fractured his skull.  Since then, no one could be persuaded to teach.

Most peasants did not miss the school.

"What's the point?"  they would say.

"You pay fees and read for years, and in the end you are still a
peasant, earning your food with your sweat.  You don't get a grain of
rice more for being able to read books.  Why waste time and money?

Might as well start earning your work points right away."

The virtual absence of any chance of a better future and the near total
immobility for anyone born a peasant took the incentive out of the
pursuit of knowledge.  Children of school age would stay at home to
help their families with their work or look after younger brothers and
sisters.  They would be out in the fields when they were barely in
their teens.  As for girls, the peasants considered it a complete waste
of time for them to go to school.

"They get married and belong to other people.  It's like pouring water
on the ground."

The Cultural Revolution was trumpeted as having brought education to
the peasants through 'evening classes."  One day my production team
announced it was starting evening classes and asked Nana and me to be
the teachers.  I was delighted.  However, as soon as the first 'class'
began, I realized that this was no education.

The classes invariably started with Nana and me being asked by the
production team leader to read out articles by Mao or other items from
the People's Daily.  Then he would make an hour-long speech consisting
of all the latest political jargon strung together in undigested and
largcl~ unintelligible hunks.  Now and then he would give specihc
orders, all solemnly delivered in the name of Mao.

"Chairman Mao says we must eat two meals of rice porridge and only one
meal of solid rice a day."

"Chairman Mao says we mustn't waste sweet potatoes on pigs."

After a hard day's work in the fields, the peasants' minds were on
their household chores.  Their evenings were valuable to them, but no
one dared to skip the 'classes."  They just sat there, and eventually
dozed off.  I was not sorry, to see this form of 'education," designed
to stupe~ rather than enlighten, gradually wither away.

Without education, the peasants' world was painfully narrow.  Their
conversations usually centered on minute details of daily living.  One
woman would spend a whole morning complaining that her sister-in-law
had used ten bundles of feather fuel for cooking breakfast when she
could have made do with nine (fuel, like everything else, was pooled).
Another would grumble for hours that her mother-in-law put too many
sweet potatoes in the rice (rice being more precious and desirable than
sweet potatoes).

I knew their restricted horizon was not their fault, but nonetheless I
found their conversations unbearable.

One unfailing topic of gossip was, of course, sex.  A twenty-year-old
woman called Mei from the Deyang county town had been assigned to the
village next to mine.

She had allegedly slept with a lot of city youths as well as peasants,
and every now and then in the fields someone would come up with a lewd
story about her.  It was rumored that she was pregnant, and had been
binding her waist to hide it.  In an effort to prove that she was not
carrying a 'bastard," Mei deliberately did all the things a pregnant
woman was not supposed to do, like carrying heavy loads.

Eventually a dead baby was discovered in the bushes next to a stream in
her village.  People said it was hers.  Nobody knew whether it had been
born dead.  Her production team leader ordered a hole dug and buried
the baby.  And that was that, apart from the gossip, which became even
more virulent.

The whole story appalled me, but there were other shocks.  One of my
neighbors had four daughters four dark-skinned, round-eyed beauties.
But the villagers did not think they were pretty.  Too dark, they said.
Pale skin was the main criterion for beauty in much of the Chinese
countryside.  When it was time for the eldest daughter to get married,
the father decided to look for a son-in-law who would come and live in
their house.  That way, he would not only keep his daughter's work
points, but would also get an extra pair of hands.  Normally, women
married into men's families, and it was considered a great humiliation
for a man to marry into a woman's family.  But our neighbor eventually
found a young man from a very poor mountain area who was desperate to
get out and could never do so except through marriage.  The young man
thus had a very low status.  I often heard his father-in-law shouting
abuse at him at the top of his voice.  To torment the young man, he
made his daughter sleep alone when the whim took him.  She did not dare
to refuse because 'filial piety," which was deep-rooted in Confucian
ethics, enjoined that children must obey their parents and because she
must not be seen as being keen to sleep with a man, even her husband:
for a woman to enjoy sex was considered shameful.  I was awakened one
morning by a commotion outside my window.  The young man had somehow
got hold of a few bottles of alcohol made with sweet potatoes and had
poured them down his throat.  His father in-law had been kicking his
bedroom door to get him to start working.  When he finally broke the
door down, the son-in-law was dead.

One day my production team was making pea noodles, and borrowed my
enamel washbowl to carry water.  That day, the noodles collapsed into a
shapeless mess.  The crowd that had gathered excitedly and expectantly
around

I Work as a Peasant and a Bare~of Doctor the noodle-making barrel
started muttering loudly when they saw me approaching, and glared at me
with disgust.

I was scared.  Later I was told by some women that the villagers blamed
the sagging noodles on me.  They said I must have used the bowl to wash
when I was menstruating.

The women told me I was lucky to be a 'city youth."  If it had been one
of them, their menfolk would have given them 'a really good hiding."

On another occasion, a group of young men passing through our village
carrying baskets of sweet potatoes were taking a break on a narrow
road.  Their shoulder poles were lying on the ground, blocking the way.
I stepped over one of them.  All of a sudden, one of the young men
jumped to his feet, picked up his pole, and stood in front of me, with
fiery eyes.  He looked as though he was going to strike me.  From the
other peasants, I learned that he believed he would develop shoulder
sores if a woman stepped over his pole.  I was made to cross back over
it 'to undo the poison."

During the whole time I was in the countryside, I never saw any attempt
to tackle such warped thinking in fact, it was never even mentioned.

The most educated person in my production team was the former landlord.
I had been conditioned to regard landlords as evil, and now, to my
initial uneasiness, I found that I got on best with this family.  They
bore no resemblance to the stereotypes that had been drilled into my
mind.  The husband did not have cruel, vicious eyes, and his wife did
not wiggle her bottom, or make her voice sugary, to appear seductive.

Sometimes, when we were alone, he would talk about his grievances.

"ChangJung," he once said, "I know you are a kind person.  You must be
a reasonable person as well, since you have read books.  You can judge
whether this is fair."  Then he told me why he had been classified as a
landlord.  He had been a waiter in Chengdu in 1948, and had saved up
some money by watching every penny.  At the time, some farsighted
landlords were selling their land cheap, as they could see land reform
coming if the Communists reached Sichuan.  The waiter was not
politically astute, and bought some land, thinking he had got a
bargain.  He not only soon lost most of it in the land reform, but
became a class enemy to boot.

"Alas," he said, with resignation, quoting a classic line, 'one single
slip has caused a thousand years of sorrow."

The villagers seemed to feel no hostility toward the landlord and his
family, although they kept their distance.  But, like all 'class
enemies," they were always given the jobs no one else wanted.  And the
two sons got one work point less than other men, in spite of the fact
that they were the hardest-working men in the village.  They seemed to
me to be highly intelligent, and also the most refined young men
around.  Their gentleness and gracefulness set them apart, and I found
that I felt closer to them than to any other young people in the
village.  However, in spite of their qualities, no girls wanted to
marry them.  Their mother told me how much money she had spent buying
presents for the few gifts whom the go-betweens had introduced.  The
gifts would accept the clothes and money and then walk off.  Other
peasants could have demanded the presents back, but a landlord's family
could do nothing.  She would sigh long and loud about the fact that her
sons had little prospect of decent marriages.  But, she told me, they
bore their misfortune lightly: after each disappointment, they would
try to cheer her up.  They would offer to work on market days to earn
back the cost of her lost presents.

All these misfortunes were told to me without much drama or emotion.
Here it seemed that even shocking deaths were like a stone being
dropped into a pond where the splash and the ripple closed over into
stillness in no lime.

In the placidity of the village, in the hushed depth of the nights in
my damp home, I did a lot of reading and thinking.  When I first came
to Deyang, Jin-ming gave me several big cases of his black-market
books, which he had been
able to accumulate because the house raiders had now mostly been
packed off to the 'cadres' school' at Miyi, together with my father.
All day while I was out in the fields, I itched to get back to them.

I devoured what had survived the burning of my father's library.  There
were the complete works of Lu Xun, the great Chinese writer of the
192os and 193os.

Because he died in 1936, before the Communists came to power, he
escaped being persecuted by Mao, and even became a great hero of his
whereas Lu Xun's favorite pupil and closest associate, Hu Feng, was
personally named by Mao as a counterrevolutionary, and was imprisoned
for decades.  It was the persecution of Hu Feng that led to the
witch-hunt in which my mother was detained in 1955.

Lu Xun had been my father's great favorite.  When I was a child, he
often read us essays by Lu.  I had not understood them at the time,
even with my father's explanations, but now I was engrossed.  I found
that their satirical edge could be applied to the Communists as well as
to the Kuomintang.  Lu Xun had no ideology, only enlightened
humanitarianism.  His skeptical genius challenged all assumptions.

He was another whose free intelligence helped liberate me from my
indoctrination.

My father's collection of Marxist classics was also useful to me.  I
read randomly, following the obscure words with my finger, and
wondering what on earth those nineteenth century German controversies
had to do with Mao's China.  But I was attracted by something I had
rarely come across in China the logic that ran through an argument.

Reading Marx helped me to think rationally and analytically.

I enjoyed these new ways of organizing my thoughts.  At other times I
would let my mind slip into more nebulous moods and wrote poetry, in
classical styles.  While I was working in the fields I was often
absorbed in composing poems, which made working bearable, at times even
agree able.  Because of this, I preferred solitude, and positively
discouraged conversation.

One day I had been working all morning, cutting cane with a sickle and
eating the juiciest parts near the roots.

The cane went to the commune sugar factory, in exchange for sugar.  We
had to fill a quota in quantity, but not in quality, so we ate the best
parts.  When lunch break came, and someone had to stay in the field to
keep watch for thieves, I offered my services so I would have some time
alone.  I would go for my lunch when the peasants came back and so have
even more time to myself.

I lay on my back on a stack of canes, a straw hat par fly shading my
face.  Through the hat I could see the vast turquoise sky.  A leaf
protruded from the stack above my head, looking disproportionately
enormous against the sky.

I half-closed my eyes, feeling soothed by the cool greenness.

The leaf reminded me of the swaying leaves of a grove of bamboo on a
similar hot summer afternoon many years before.  Sitting in its shade
fishing, my father had written a forlorn poem.  In the same ge-lu
pattern of tones, rhymes, and types of words as his poem, I began to
compose one of my own.  The universe seemed to be standing still, apart
from the light rustle of the refreshing breeze in the cane leaves. Life
felt beautiful to me at that moment.

In this period, I snatched at the chance for solitude, and
ostentatiously showed that I wanted nothing to do with the world around
me, which must have made me seem rather arrogant.  And because the
peasants were the model I was meant to emulate, I reacted by
concentrating on their negative qualities.  I did not try to get to
know them, or to get on with them.

I was not very popular in the village, although the peasants largely
left me alone.  They disapproved of me for failing to work as hard as
they thought I should.  Work was their whole life, and the major
criterion by which they judged anyone.  Their eye for hard work was
both uncompromising and fair, and it was clear to them that I hated
physical labor and took every opportunity to stay at home and read my
books. The stomach trouble and skin rash I had suffered in Ningnan hit
me again as soon as I came to Deyang.  Virtually every day I had some
sort of diarrhea, and my legs broke out in infected sores.  I
constantly felt weak and dizzy, but it was no good complaining to the
peasants; their harsh life had made them regard all nonfatal illnesses
as trivial.

The thing that made me most unpopular, though, was that I was often
away.  I spent about two-thirds of the time that I should have been in
Deyang visiting my parents in their camps, or looking after Aunt
Jun-ying in Yibin.  Each trip lasted several months, and there was no
law forbidding it.  But although I did not work nearly enough to earn
my keep, I still took food from the village.  The peasants were stuck
with their egalitarian distribution system, and they were stuck with me
they could not throw me out.  Naturally, they blamed me, and I felt
sorry for them.  But I was stuck with them, too.  I could not get
out.

In spite of their resentment, my production team allowed me to come and
go as I liked, which was partly because I had kept my distance from
them.  I learned that the best way to get by was to be regarded as an
unobtrusively aloof outsider.  Once you became 'one of the masses," you
immediately let yourself in for intrusion and control.

Meanwhile, my sister Xiao-hong was doing well in the neighboring
village.  Although, like me, she was perpetually bitten by He as and
poisoned by manure so that her legs were sometimes so swollen she got
fever, she continued to work hard, and was awarded eight work points a
day.  Specs often came from Chengdu to help her.  His factory, like
most others, was at a virtual standstill.  The management had been
'smashed," and the new Revolutionary Committee was only concerned with
getting the workers to take part in the revolution rather than in
production, and most just came and went as they pleased.  Sometimes
Specs worked in the fields in my sister's place to give her a break.

At other times, he worked with her, which delighted the villagers, who
said: "This is a bargain.  We took in one young girl, but we've ended
up with two pairs of hands!"

Nana, my sister, and I used to go to the country market together on
market day, which was once a week.  I loved the boisterous alleys lined
with baskets and shoulder poles.

The peasants would walk for hours to sell a single chicken or a dozen
eggs, or a bundle of bamboo.  Most moneymaking activities, such as
growing cash crops, making baskets, or raising pigs for sale, were
banned for individual households, on the grounds that they were
'capitalist."  As a result, peasants had very little to exchange for
cash.  Without money, it was impossible for them to travel to cities,
and market day was almost their only source of entertainment.  They
would meet up with their relatives and friends, the men squatting on
the muddy pavements puffing on their pipes.

In spring 197o my sister and Specs were married.  There was no
ceremony.  In the atmosphere of the day, it did not cross their minds
to have one.  They just collected their marriage certificate from the
commune headquarters and then went back to my sister's village with
sweets and cigarettes with which to entertain the villagers.  The
peasants were thrilled: they could rarely afford these precious
treats.

For the peasants, a wedding was a big thing.  As soon as the news
broke, they crowded into my sister's thatched cottage to offer their
congratulations.  They brought presents like a handful of dried
noodles, a pound of soybeans, and a few eggs, wrapped carefully in red
straw paper and fled with straw in a fancy knot.  These were no
ordinary gifts.  The peasants had deprived themselves of valuable
items.  My sister and Specs were very touched.  When Nana and I went to
see the new couple, they were teaching the village children how to do
'loyalty dances' for fun.

Marriage did not get my sister out of the countryside,

I Work as a Peasant and a Bare~of Donor 567 as couples were not
automatically granted residence together.  Of course, if Specs had been
willing to relinquish his city registration, he could easily have set
fled with my sister, but she could not move to Chengdu with him because
she had a country registration.  Like tens of millions of couples in
China, they lived separately, entitled by regulation to twelve days a
year together.  Luckily for them, Specs's factory was not working
normally, so he could spend a lot of time in Deyang.

After a year in Deyang there was a change in my life: I entered the
medical profession.  The production brigade to which my team belonged
ran a clinic which dealt with simple illnesses.  It was funded by all
the production teams under the brigade, and treatment was free, but
very limited.

There were two doctors.  One of them, a young man with a fine,
intelligent face, had graduated from the medical school of Deyang
County in the fifties, and had come back to work in his native village.
The other was middle-aged with a goatee.  He had started out as an
apprentice to an old country doctor practicing Chinese medicine, and in
1964 he had been sent by the commune to attend a crash course in
Western medicine.

At the beginning of 197x, the commune authorities ordered the clinic to
take on a 'barefoot doctor."  The name came about because the 'doctor'
was supposed to live like the peasants, who treasured their shoes too
much to wear them in the muddy fields.  At the time, there was a big
propaganda campaign hailing barefoot doctors as an invention of the
Cultural Revolution.  My production team jumped at this opportunity to
get rid of me: if I worked in the clinic, the brigade, rather than my
team, would be responsible for my food and other income.

I had always wanted to be a doctor.  The illnesses in my family,
particularly the death of my grandmother, had driven home to me how
important doctors were.  Before I went to Deyang, I had started
learning acupuncture from a friend, and I had been studying a book
called A Barefoot

Doctor's Manual, one of the few printed items allowed in those days.

The propaganda about barefoot doctors was one of Mao's political
maneuvers.  He had condemned the pre Cultural Revolution Health
Ministry for not looking after peasants and concerning itself only with
city dwellers, especially Party officials.  He also condemned doctors
for not wanting to work in the countryside, particularly in the remote
areas.  But Mao took no responsibility as head of the regime, nor did
he order any practical steps to remedy the situation, such as giving
instructions to build more hospitals or train more proper doctors, and
during the Cultural Revolution the medical situation got worse.  The
propaganda line about peasants having no doctors was really intended to
generate hatred against the pre-Cultural Revolution Party system, and
against intellectuals (this category included doctors and nurses).

Mao offered a magic cure to the peasants: 'doctors' who could be turned
out en masse barefoot doctors.

"It is not at all necessary to have so much formal training," he
said.

"They should mainly learn and raise their standard in practice."  On
26June 1965 he made the remark which became a guideline for health and
education: "The more books you read, the more stupid you become."  I
went to work with absolutely no training.

The clinic was in a large hall on top of a hill about an hour's walk
from my cottage.  Next door was a shop selling matches, salt, and soy
sauce which were all rationed.  One of the surgery rooms became my
bedroom.  My professional duties were left vague.

The only medical book I had ever set eyes on was A Barefoot Doctor's
Manual.  I studied it avidly.  There was no theory in it, just a
summary of symptoms, followed by suggested prescriptions.  When I sat
at my desk, with the other two doctors behind me, all wearing our dusty
everyday clothes, it was clear that the sick peasants who came in very
sensibly wanted nothing to do with me, an inexperi

I Work as a Peasant and a BareJbot Doctor 569 enced eighteen-year-old
with some sort of book they could not read, and which was not even very
thick.  They went straight past me to the other two desks.  I felt more
relieved than offended.  It was not my idea of being a doctor to have
to consult a book every time patients described their symptoms, and
then to copy down the recommended prescription.  Sometimes, in an
ironic mood, I would contemplate whether our new leaders Chairman Mao
was still beyond questioning would want me as their personal doctor,
barefoot or not.  But then, I told myself, of course not: barefoot
doctors were supposed to 'serve the people, not the officials' in the
first place.  I settled happily for just being a nurse, doling out
medicines on prescription and giving injections, which I had learned to
give to my mother for her hemorrhage.

The young doctor who had been to medical school was the one everybody
wanted.  His prescriptions of Chinese herbs cured many ailments.  He
was very conscientious, too, visiting patients in their villages and
collecting and growing herbs in his spare time.  The other doctor, with
the goatee, terrified me with his medical nonchalance.  He would use
the same needle to inject several different patients without any
sterilization.  And he injected penicillin without testing whether the
person was allergic to it, which was extremely dangerous because
Chinese penicillin was not pure and could cause serious reactions, even
death.

Politely, I offered to do it for him.  He smiled, not offended by my
interference, and said there had never been any accidents: "The
peasants are not like delicate city folk."

I liked the doctors, and they were very kind to me, always helpful when
I asked questions.  Not surprisingly, they did not see me as a threat.
Out in the countryside, it was one's professional skills, rather than
political rhetoric, that counted.

I enjoyed living on that hilltop, far away from any village.

Every morning I got up early, strolled along the edge of the hill, and
to the rising sun recited lines from an ancient book of verse about
acupuncture.  Beneath my feet, the fields and cottages began to wake up
to the cocks' crowing.

A lonely Venus watched with a pale glow from a sky that was getting
brighter every minute.  I loved the fragrance of the honeysuckle in the
morning breeze, and the big petals of nightshade shaking off pearls of
dew.  Birds chirped all around, distracting me from my recitations.  I
would linger for a bit, and then walk back to light my stove for
breakfast.

With the help of an anatomical chart and my acupuncture verses, I had a
fairly clear idea where on the body I should stick my needles to cure
what.  I was eager for patients.  And I had some enthusiastic
volunteers boys from Chengdu who were now living in other villages and
who were keen on me.  They would walk for hours for an acupuncture
session.  One young man, rolling up his sleeve to expose an acupuncture
point near his elbow, declared with a brave face, "What are men friends
for?"

I did not fall in love with any of them, although my resolution to deny
myself a boyfriend in order to dedicate myself to my parents and
appease my guilt over my grandmother's death was weakening.  But I
found it difficult to let my heart go, and my upbringing prevented me
from having any physical relationship without surrendering my heart.
All around me, other boys and girls from the city were leading rather
freer lives.  But I sat, lonely, on a pedestal.  Word got out that I
wrote poetry, and that helped keep me there.

The young men all behaved most chivalrously.  One gave me a musical
instrument called a san-xian, made of a snakeskin bowl with a long
handle and three silk strings, which were plucked, and spent days
teaching me how to play it.  The permitted tunes were all in praise of
Mao, and were very limited.  But that did not make much difference to
me: my ability was even more limited.

In the warm evenings, I sat by the fragrant medicinal garden encircled
by Chinese trumpet creepers, and thrummed to myself.  Once the shop
next door closed for the night, I was
entirely alone.  It was dark except for the gently shining moon and the
twinkling of lights from distant cottages.  Sometimes fireflies glowed
and floated by like torches carried by tiny, invisible flying men.  The
scents from the garden made me dizzy with pleasure.  My music hardly
matched the enthusiastic chorus of the thundering frogs and the wistful
croon of the crickets.  But I found solace in it.

24.  "Please Accept My Apologies That Come a Lifetime Too Late'-My

Three days' truck journey from Chengdu, in northern Xichang, is Buffalo
Boy Flatland.  There the road forks, one branch heading southwest to
Miyi, where my father's camp was, the other southeast to Ningnan.

A famous legend gave the Flatland its name.  The Goddess Weaver,
daughter of the Celestial Queen Mother, used to descend from the
Celestial Court to bathe in a lake there.  (The meteor which fell on
Meteorite Street is supposed to have been a stone that propped up her
loom.) A boy living by the lake who looks after buffaloes sees the
goddess, and they fall in love.  They marry, and have a son and a
daughter.  The Celestial Queen Mother is jealous of their happiness,
and sends some gods down to kidnap the goddess.  They carry her off,
and the buffalo boy rushes after them.  Just as he is about to catch
them, the Celestial Queen Mother pulls a hairpin from her coil and
draws a huge river between them.  The Silver River separates the couple
permanently, except on the seventh day of the seventh moon, when
magpies fly from all over China to form a bridge for the family to
meet.

The Silver River is the Chinese name for the Milky Way.  Over Xichang
it looks vast, with a mass of stars, the bright Vega, the Goddess
Weaver, on one side, and Altair, the Buffalo Boy, with his two
children, on the other.  This legend has appealed to the Chinese for
centuries because their families have often been broken up by wars,
bandits, poverty, and heartless governments.  Ironically, it was to
this place that my mother was sent.

She arrived there in November 1969, with her 500 former colleagues from
the Eastern District Rebels as well as capitalist-roaders.  Because
they had been ordered out of Chengdu in a hurry there was nowhere for
them to live, except for a few shacks left by army engineers who had
been building a railway from Chengdu to Kunming, the capital of Yunnan.
Some squeezed into these.

Others had to cram their bedrolls into the houses of local peasants.

There were no building materials except cogon grass and mud, which had
to be dug out and carried down from the mountains.  The mud for the
walls was mixed with water and made into bricks.  There were no
machines, no electricity, not even any work animals.  On the Flatland,
which is about 5,000 feet above sea level, it is the day, rather than
the year, that is divided into four seasons.  At seven in the morning,
when my mother started working, the temperature was around freezing. By
midday, it could reach the high 8os.  At about 4 p.m. hot winds swirled
through the mountains and literally swept people off their feet.  At
seven in the evening, when they finished work, the temperature
plummeted again.  In these harsh extremes my mother and the other
inmates worked twelve hours a day, breaking only for a brief lunch. 
For the first few months, all they had to eat was rice and boiled
cabbage.

The camp was organized like an army, run by army officers, and came
under the control of the Chengdu Revolutionary Committee.  At first my
mother was treated as a class enemy and was forced to stand for the
whole of every lunch break with her head bowed.  This form of
punishment, called field side denunciation," was recommended by the
media as a way to remind the others, who were able to rest, that they
should save some energy for hatred.  My mother protested to her company
commander that she could not work all day without resting her legs. The
officer had been in the Military Department of the Eastern District
before the Cultural Revolution, and had got on well with her; he put a
stop to the practice.  Still, my mother was given the hardest jobs, and
she did not have Sundays off, unlike the other inmates.  The bleeding
from her womb worsened.  Then she was struck down with hepatitis.  Her
whole body was yellow and swollen, and she could hardly stand up.

One thing the camp did have was doctors, as half the hospital staff in
the Eastern District had been packed off there.  Only those who were
most in demand by the bosses of the Revolutionary Committees remained
in Chengdu.

The doctor who treated my mother told her how grateful he and the other
hospital staff were to her for protecting them before the Cultural
Revolution, and said that had it not been for her he would probably
have been labeled a rightist back in 1957.  There was no Western
medicine available, so he went miles to gather herbs like Asiatic
plantain and sun plants which the Chinese consider good for
hepatitis.

He also exaggerated the infectiousness of her illness to the camp
authorities, who then moved her to a place entirely on her own, half a
mile away.  Her tormentors left her alone, for fear of infection, but
the doctor came to see her every day, and secretly ordered a daily
supply of goat's milk from a local peasant.  My mother's new residence
was a deserted pigsty.  Sympathetic inmates cleaned it for her and put
a thick layer of hay on the ground.  It felt to her like a luxurious
mattress.  A friendly cook volunteered to deliver meals.  When no one
was looking, she would include

,?

3/I), Parents in Camps 575 a couple of eggs.  When meat became
available, my mother had it every day, while the others got it only
once a week.

She also had fresh fruit pears and peaches provided by friends who
bought them at markets.  As far as she was concerned, her hepatitis was
a godsend.

After about forty days, much to her regret, she recovered and was moved
back into the camp, now housed in new mud huts.  The Flatland is an odd
place in that it attracts lightning and thunder but not rain, which
falls on the surrounding mountains.  The local peasants did not plant
crops on the plains, because the soil was too dry and it was dangerous
during the frequent dry thunderstorms.  But this land was the only
resource available to the camp, so they planted a special strain of
drought-resistant corn and carried water from the lower slopes of the
mountains.  In order to get a future supply of rice, they offered to
help the local peasants harvest theirs.

The peasants agreed, but it was the local custom that women were
forbidden to carry water and men were barred from planting rice, which
could only be done by married women with children, particularly sons.
The more sons a woman had, the more she was in demand for this
backbreaking job.  The belief was that a woman who had produced a lot
of sons would produce more grains in the rice she planted ('sons' and
'seeds' have the same sound, zi, in Chinese).  My mother was the prime
'beneficiary' of this ancient custom.  As she had three sons, more than
most of her women colleagues, she had to spend up to fifteen hours a
day bent double in the paddy fields, with an inflamed lower abdomen,
and bleeding.

At night, she joined everyone else in taking turns to guard the pigs
from wolves.  The mud-and-grass shacks backed on to a range of
mountains aptly called "Wolves' Lair."  The wolves were very clever,
the locals told the new arrivals.  When one got into a pigsty, it would
gently scratch and lick a pig, particularly behind its ears, to get the
animal into a kind of pleasurable trance, so it would not make a noise.
Then the wolf would lightly bite the pig on one ear and lead it out of
the sty, all the time rubbing its body with its fluffy tail.  The pig
would still be dreaming of being caressed by a lover when the wolf
pounced.

The peasants told the city folk that the wolves and occasional leopards
were afraid of fires.  So every night a fire was lit outside the
pigsty.  My mother spent many sleepless nights watching meteors
shooting across the starlit vault of the sky, with the silhouette of
the Wolves' Lair against it, listening to the distant howling of the
wolves.

One evening she was washing her clothes in a small pond.  When she
straightened up from her squatting position she found she was staring
straight into the red eyes of a wolf standing about twenty yards away
across the pond.

Her hair stood on end, but she remembered that her childhood friend Big
Old Lee had told her that the way to deal with a wolf was to walk
backwards, slowly, never showing any sign of panic, and not to turn and
run.  So she backed away from the pond and walked as calmly as she
could toward the camp, all the time facing the wolf, who followed her.
When she reached the edge of the camp, the wolf stopped.  The fire was
in sight, and voices could be heard.

She swung around and raced into a doorway.

The fire was almost the only light in the depth of the nights in
Xichang.  There was no electricity.  Candles, when available at all,
were prohibitively expensive, and there was very little kerosene.  But
there was not much to read anyway.  Unlike Deyang, where I had relative
freedom to read Jin-ming's black-market books, a cadres' school was
lightly controlled.  The only printed materials allowed were the
selected works of Mao and the People's DaiS.  Occasionally, a new film
was shown in an army barracks a few miles away: it was invariably one
of Mine Mao's model operas.

As the days, then months went by, the harsh work and lack of relaxation
became unbearable.  Everyone missed their families and children, the
Rebels included.  Their resentment was perhaps more intense because
they now felt that all their past zealotry had turned out to be for
nothing, and that whatever they did, they would never get back to power
in Chengdu.  The Revolutionary Committees had been filled in their
absence.  Within months of reaching the Flatland, depression replaced
denunciations, and the Rebels sometimes had to be cheered up by my
mother.  She was given the nickname "Kuanyin' the goddess of
kindness.

At night, lying on her straw mattress, she thought back over her
children's early years.  She realized that there was not an awful lot
of family life to remember.  She had been an absentee mother when we
were growing up, having submitted herself to the cause at the cost of
her family.

Now she reflected with remorse on the pointlessness of her devotion.
She found she missed her children with a pain which was almost
unendurable.

Ten days before Chinese New Year, in February 197o, after over three
months on the Flatland, my mother's company was lined up in front of
their camp to welcome an army commander who was coming for an
inspection.  After waiting for a long time, the crowd spotted a small
figure approaching along the dirt track which climbed up from the
distant road.  They all stared at the moving figure, and decided it
could not be the big shot: he would be in a car with an entourage.  But
it could not be a local peasant, either: the way the long black wool
scarf was wrapped around the bent head was too stylish.  It was a young
woman with a large basket on her back.  Watching her slowly coming
nearer and nearer, my mother's heart started pounding.  She felt it
looked like me, and then she thought she might be imagining it.

"How wonderful it would be if it was Er-hong!"  she said to herself.
Suddenly, people were nudging her excitedly: "It's your daughter!  Your
daughter's here to see you!  Er-hong's here!"

This was my mother's account of how she saw me coming after what seemed
to her a lifetime.  I was the first visitor to the camp, and was
received with a mixture of warmth and envy.  I had come on the same
truck which had taken me to Ningnan to get my registration moved in
June the year before.  The big basket on my back was full of sausages,
eggs, sweets, cakes, noodles, sugar, and finned meats.  All five of us
children and Specs had pooled things from our rations, or our shares
from our production teams, to give our parents a treat.  I was
practically dragged down by the weight.

Two things immediately struck me.  My mother looked well she was just
over her convalescence from hepatitis, as she told me later.  And the
atmosphere around her was not hostile.  In fact, some people were
already calling her "Kuanyin," which was absolutely incredible to me
since she was officially a class enemy.

A dark-blue scarf covered her hair and was knotted under her chin.  Her
cheeks were no longer fine and delicate.  They had turned rough and
deep red under the fierce sun and harsh wind, and her skin looked very
much like that of a Xichang peasant.  She appeared at least ten years
older than her thirty-eight years.  When she stroked my face, her hands
felt like cracked old tree bark.

I stayed ten days, and was to depart for my father's camp on New Year's
Day.  My nice truck driver was to pick me up where he had dropped me
off.  My mother's eyes moistened because, although his camp was not far
away, she and my father were forbidden to visit each other.  I put the
food basket on my back untouched my mother insisted I take the whole
lot to my father.  Saving precious food for others has always been a
major way of expressing love and concern in China.  My mother was very
sad that I was going, and kept saying she was sorry I had to miss the
traditional Chinese New Year breakfast which her camp was going to
serve: tang-yuan, round dumplings, symbolizing family union.  But I
could not wait for it for fear of missing the truck.

My mother walked half an hour with me to the roadside and we sat down
in the high grass to wait.  The sweep of the landscape undulated with
the gentle waves of the thick cogon grass.  The sun was already bright
and warm.  M?

mother hugged me, her whole body seeming to say that she did not want
to let me go, that she was afraid she would never see me again.  At the
time, we did not know whether her camp and my commune would ever come
to an end.

We had been told we would be there for life.  There were hundreds of
reasons why we might die before we saw each other again.  My mother's
sadness infected me, and I thought of my grandmother dying before I was
able to get back from Ningnan.

The sun rose higher and higher.  There was no trace of my truck.  As
the large rings of smoke that had been pouring out of the chimney of
her camp in the distance thinned down, my mother was seized by regret
that she had not been able to give me the New Year's breakfast.  She
insisted on going back to get some for me.

While she was away the truck came.  I looked toward the camp and saw
her running toward me, the white-golden grass surging around her blue
scarf.  In her right hand she carried a big colorful enamel bowl.  She
was running with the kind of carefulness that told me she did not want
the soup with the dumplings to spill.  She was still a good way off,
and I could see she would not reach me for another twenty minutes or
so.  I did not feel I could ask the driver to wait that long, as he was
already doing me a big favor.

I clambered onto the back of the truck.  I could see my mother still
running toward me in the distance.  But she no longer seemed to be
carrying the bowl.

Years later, she told me the bowl had fallen from her hand when she saw
me climbing onto the truck.  But she still ran to the spot where we had
been sitting, just to make sure I had really gone, although it could
not have been anyone else getting onto the truck.  There was not a
single person around in that vast yellow ness  For the next few days
she walked around the camp as though in a trance, feeling blank and
lost.

58o "Please Accept My Apologies..."

After many hours of being bounced around on the back of the truck, I
arrived at my father's camp.  It was deep in the mountains, and had
been a forced labor camp a gulag.  The prisoners had hacked a farm out
of the wild mountains and had since been moved on to open up more harsh
virgin land, leaving this relatively cultivated site for those one rung
better off on China's punishment ladder, the deported officials.  The
camp was huge: it held thousands of former employees of the provincial
government.

I had to walk for a couple of hours from the road to reach my father's
'company."  A rope suspension bridge wobbled over a deep chasm as I
stepped onto it, almost making me lose my balance.  Exhausted as I was,
with the load on my back, I still managed to be amazed by the stunning
beauty of the mountains.  Although it was only early spring, bright
flowers were everywhere, next to kapok trees and bushes of papayas.
When I finally got to my father's dormitory, I saw a couple of colorful
pheasants swaggering majestically under a glade of early pear, plum,
and almond blossoms.  Weeks later, the fallen petals, pink and white,
were to bury the mud path.

My first sight of my father after over a year was harrowing.  He was
trotting into the courtyard carrying two baskets full of bricks on a
shoulder pole.  His old blue jacket hung loose on him, and his
rolled-up trouser legs revealed a pair of very thin legs with prominent
sinews.  His sun-beaten face was wrinkled, and his hair was almost
gray.  Then he saw me.  He put down his load with a fumbling movement,
the result of over excitement as I rushed over to him.

Because the Chinese tradition permitted little physical contact between
fathers and daughters, he told me how happy he was through his eyes.
They were so full of love and tenderness.  In them I also saw traces of
the ordeal he had been going through.  His youthful energy and spark
had given way to an air of aged confusion with a hint of quiet
determination.  Yet he was still in his prime, only forty-eight years
old.  A lump rose in my throat.  I searched his eyes

My Parents in Camps 58 I for signs of my worst fear, the return of his
insanit)'.  But he looked all right.  A heavy load lifted from my
heart.

He was sharing a room with seven other people, all from his department.
There was only one tiny window, so the door had to be left open all day
to let in some light.  The people in the room seldom spoke to each
other, and no one greeted me at all.  I felt immediately that the
atmosphere was much more severe than in my mother's camp.

The reason was that this camp was under the direct control of the
Sichuan Revolutionary Committee, and therefore of the Tings.  On the
walls of the courtyard there were still layers of posters and slogans
reading "Down with Soand-so' or "Eliminate So-and-so," against which
were propped scarred hoes and spades.  As I soon discovered, my father
was still being subjected to frequent denunciation meetings in the
evenings after a hard day's work.  Since one way to get out of the camp
was to be invited back to work for the Revolutionary Committee, and the
way to do that was to please the Tings, some Rebels competed with each
other to demonstrate their militancy, and my father was their natural
victim.

He was not allowed into the kitchen.  As an 'anti-Mao criminal," he was
alleged to be so dangerous he might poison the food.  It did not matter
whether anyone believed this.  The point was in the insult.

My father bore this and other cruelties with fortitude.

Only once did he allow his anger to show.  When he first came to the
camp, he was ordered to wear a white arm band with black characters
saying 'counterrevolutionary element in action."  He pushed away the
arm band violently and said from between clenched teeth, "Come on and
beat me to death.  I will not wear this!"  The Rebels backed away. They
knew he meant it and they had no order from above to kill him.

Here in the camp, the Tings were able to revenge themselves on their
enemies.  Among them was a man who had been involved in the
investigation into them in 1965.  He
had worked in the underground before 1949, and had been imprisoned and
tortured by the Kuomintang, which had destroyed his health.  In the
camp he soon fell gravely ill, but he had to go on working, and was not
allowed a single day off.  Because he was slow, he was ordered to make
it up in the evenings.  Wall posters denounced him for his laziness.
One of the posters I saw opened with the words:

"Have you, Comrade, noticed this grotesque living skeleton with hideous
facial features?"  Under Xichang's relentless sun, his skin had become
scorched and withered, and was peeling off in great chunks.  Also, he
was starved out of human shape: he had had two-thirds of his stomach
cut out, and could digest only a small amount of food at a time.

Because he could not have frequent meals, as he needed to, he was
permanently starving.  One day, in desperation, he went into the
kitchen to look for some pickle juice.  He was accused of trying to
poison the food.  Knowing he was on the verge of total collapse, he
wrote to the camp authorities saying that he was dying and requesting
to be spared some heavy jobs.  The only answer was a venomous poster
campaign.  Soon afterward he fainted in a field under the blazing sun,
as he was spreading manure.  He was taken to the camp hospital and died
the next day.  He had no family at his deathbed.  His wife had
committed suicide.

The capitalist-roaders were not the only ones who suffered in the
cadres' school.  People who had had any connection, however remote,
with the Kuomintang, anyone who had by some misfortune become the
target of some personal revenge, or the object of jealousy even leaders
of the unsuccessful Rebel factions had been dying in the camp in
scores.  Many had thrown themselves into the roaring river that sliced
through the valley.  The river was called "Tranquillity' (An-ning-he).
In the dead of night, its echoes spread many miles, and sent chills up
the spines of the inmates, who said it sounded like the sobbing of
ghosts.

Hearing about these suicides increased my determination to help relieve
the mental and physical pressure on my father as a matter of urgency. 
I had to make him feel lift.  was worth living, and that he was loved. 
At his denunciation meetings, which were now largely nonviolent, as the
inmates had run out of steam, I would sit where he could see me, so
that he could feel reassured by my being with him.  As soon as the
meeting was over, we would go off together on our own.  I would tell
him cheerful things to make him forget the ugliness of the meeting, and
massage his head, neck, and shoulders.  And he would recite classical
poems for me.  During the day, I helped him with his jobs, which,
naturally, were the hardest and dirtiest.  Sometimes I would carry his
loads, which weighed over a hundred pounds.  I managed to show him a
nonchalant face, although I could hardly stand under the weight.

I stayed over three months.  The authorities allowed me to eat in the
canteen, and gave me a bed in a room with five other women, who only
spoke to me briefly and coldly, if at all.  Most of the inmates
immediately assumed an air of hostility whenever they saw me.  I just
looked through them.  But there were kind people as well, or people who
were more courageous than others in showing their kindness.

One was a man in his late twenties with a sensitive face and big ears.
His name was Young, and he was a university graduate who had come to
work in my father's par anent just before the Cultural Revolution.  He
was the 'commander' of the 'squad' to which my father belonged.

Although he was obliged to assign the hardest jobs to my father,
whenever he could he would unobtrusively reduce his workload.  In one
of my fleeting conversations with him, I told him that I could not cook
the food I had brought with me, as there was no kerosene for my small
stove.

A couple of days later, Young sauntered past me with a blank expression
on his face.  I felt something metal thrust into my hand: it was a wire
burner about eight inches high and four inches in diameter, which he
had made himself.

It burned paper balls made out of old newspapers they could be torn up
now because Mao's portrait had disappeared from the pages.  (Mao
himself had stopped the practice, as he considered that its purpose 'to
greatly and especially establish' his 'absolute supreme authority' had
been achieved, and to go on with it would only result in overkill.) On
the burner's blue-and-orange flames I produced food that was far
superior to the camp fare.  When the delicious steam seeped through the
saucepan, I could see the jaws of my father's seven roommates
involuntarily masfcatng.  I regretted that I could not offer any of it
to Young: we would both be in trouble if his militant colleagues got
wind of it.

It was thanks to Young and other decent people like him that my father
was allowed to have visits from his children.

It was also Young who gave my father permission to leave the camp
premises on rainy days, which were his only days off, since, unlike
other inmates, he had to work on Sundays, just like my mother.  As soon
as it stopped raining, my father and I would go into the forests and
collect wild mushrooms under the pine trees, or search for wild peas,
which I would cook with a fin of duck or some other meat back in the
camp.  We would enjoy a heavenly meal.

After supper we often strolled to my favorite spot, which I called my
'zoological garden' - a group of fantastically shaped rocks in a grassy
clearing in the woods.  They looked like a herd of bizarre animals
lazing in the sun.

Some of them had hollows that fitted our bodies, and we would lie back
and gaze into the distance.  Down the slope from us was a row of
gigantic kapok trees, their leafless scarlet flowers, bigger versions
of magnolia, growing directly from the stark black branches, which all
grew uncompromisingly straight up.  During my months in the camp, I had
watched these giant flowers open, a mass of crimson against black. Then
they bore fruit as big as figs, and each burst into silky wool, which
was blown all over the mountains like feathery snow by the warm
winds.

Beyond the kapok trees lay the River of Tranquillity, and beyond it
stretched endless mountains.

One day when we were relaxing in our 'zoological garden," a peasant
passed by who was so gnarled and dwarfish he gave me a fright.  My
father told me that in this isolated region inbreeding was common. Then
he said, "There is so much to be done in these mountains!  It is such a
beautiful place with great potential.  I'd love to come and live here
to look after a commune, or maybe a production brigade, and do some
real work.  Something useful.

Or maybe just be an ordinary peasant.  I am so fed up with being an
official.  How nice it would be if our family could come here and enjoy
the simple life of the farmers."  In his eyes, I saw the frustration of
an energetic, talented man who was desperate to work.  I also
recognized the traditional idyllic dream of the Chinese scholar
disillusioned with his mandarin career.  Above all, I could see that an
alternative life had become a fantasy for my father, something
wonderful and unobtainable, because there was no opting out once you
were a Communist official.

I visited the camp three times, staying each time for several months.
My siblings did the same, so that my father would have warmth around
him all the time.  He often said proudly that he was the envy of the
camp because no one else had so much company from their children.
Indeed, few had any visitors at all: the Cultural Revolution had
brutalized human relationships, and alienated countless families.

My family became closer as time went by.  My brother Xiao-her, who had
been beaten by my father when he was a child, now came to love him.  On
his first visit to the camp, he and my father had to sleep on a single
bed because the camp leaders were jealous that my father had so much
family company.  In order to let my father have a good night's sleep
which was particularly important for his mental condition Xiao-her
would never allow himself to fall into a deep sleep lest he stretch out
and disturb him.

For his part, my father reproached himself for having been harsh to
Xiao-her, and would stroke his head and apologize.

"It seems inconceivable I could have hit you so hard.  I was too tough
on you," he would say.

"I've been thinking a lot about the past, and I feel very guilty toward
you.  Funny the Cultural Revolution should turn me into a better
person."

The camp fare was mainly boiled cabbage, and the lack of protein made
people feel hungry all the time.  Every meat-eating day was eagerly
anticipated, and celebrated with an air almost of exhilaration.  Even
the most militant Rebels seemed to be in a better humor.  On these
occasions, my father would pick the meat from his bowl and force it
into his children's.  There would always be a kind of fight with
chopsticks and bowls.

My father was in a constant state of remorse.  He told me how he had
not invited my grandmother to his wedding, and had sent her on the
perilous journey back to Manchuria from Yibin only a month after she
had arrived.  I heard him reproach himself many times for not showing
his own mother enough affection, and for being so rigid that he was not
even told about her funeral.  He would shake his head: "It's too late
now!"  He also blamed himself for his treatment of his sister Jun-ying
in the 1950S, when he had tried to persuade her to give up her Buddhist
beliefs, and even to get her, a vegetarian by conviction, to eat
meat.

Aunt Jun-ying died in the summer of 1970.  Her paralysis had gradually
invaded her whole body, and she had received no proper treatment.  She
died in the same state of quiet composure as she had shown all her
life.  My family kept the news from my father.  We all knew how deeply
he loved and respected her.

That autumn my brothers Xiao-her and Xiao-fang were staying with my
father.  One day they were having a walk after supper, when
eight-year-old Xiao-fang let slip the news that Aunt Jun-ying had died.
Suddenly, my father's face changed.  He stood still, looking blank for
a long time, then turned to the side of the path, sagged onto his
haunches, and covered his face with both hands.  His shoulders shook
with sobs.  Never having seen my father cry, my brothers were
dumbfounded.

At the beginning of 197x news filtered through that the Tings had been
sacked.  For my parents, particularly my father, there was some
improvement in their lives.  They began to have Sundays off and lighter
jobs.  The other detainees started to speak to my father, though still
coldly.

Proof that things really were changing came when a new inmate arrived
at the camp early in 1971 Mrs.  Shau, my father's old tormentor, who
had fallen from grace together with the Tings.  Then my mother was
allowed to spend two weeks with my father the first chance for them to
be together for several years, in fact the first time they had even
glimpsed each other since the winter morning on the street in Chengdu
just before my father's departure for the camp, over two years
before.

But my parents' misery was far from over.  The Cultural Revolution
continued.  The Tings had not been purged because of all the evil they
had done, but because they were suspected by Mao of being closely
linked to Chen Boda, one of the leaders of the Cultural Revolution
Authority, who had fallen foul of Mao.  In this purge, more victims
were generated.  Chen Mo, the Tings' right-hand man, who had helped
secure my father's release from prison, committed suicide.

One day in the summer of 1971 my mother had a severe hemorrhage from
her womb; she passed out and had to be taken to a hospital.  My father
was not permitted to visit her, although they were both in Xichang.
When her condition stabilized, she was allowed to go back to Chengdu
for treatment.  There, the bleeding was finally stopped; but the
doctors discovered that she had developed a skin disease called
scleroderma.  A patch of skin behind her right ear had turned hard and
had begun to contract.  The right side of her jaw had become
considerably smaller than the left, and the hearing in her right ear
was going.  The right side of her neck was stiff, and her right hand
and arm felt rigid and numb.  Dermatologists told her the hardening of
the skin could eventually spread to the internal organs and, if so, she
would shrink and die in three or four years.  They said there was
nothing Western medicine could do.  All they could suggest was corf
sone which my mother took in the form of tablets and injections in her
neck.

I was in the camp with my father when a letter came from Mother with
the news.  Immediately my father went to ask for permission to go home
and see her.  Young was very sympathetic, but the camp authorities
refused.  My father burst out crying in front of a whole courtyard of
inmates.  The people from his department were taken aback.  They knew
him as a 'man of iron."  Early the next morning, he went to the post
office and waited outside for hours until it opened.  He sent a
three-page telegram to my mother.  It began: "Please accept my
apologies that come a lifetime too late.  It is for my guilt toward you
that I am happy for any punishment.  I have not been a decent husband.
Please get well and give me another chance."

On z5 October 197i, Specs came to see me in Deyang with a dynamite
piece of news: Lin Biao had been killed.

Specs had been officially told in his factory that Lin had attempted to
assassinate Mao and that, having failed, he had tried to flee to the
Soviet Union, and his plane had crashed in Mongolia.

Lin Biao's death was shrouded in mystery.  It was linked with the
downfall of Chen Boda a year before.  Mao grew suspicious of both of
them when they went too far with their over-the-top deification of him,
which he suspected was part of a scheme to kick him upstairs to
abstract glory and deprive him of earthly power.  Mao particularly
smelled a rat with Lin Biao, his chosen successor, who was known i l
for 'never letting the Little Red Book leave his hand, nor "Long live
Mao!"  leave his lips," as a later rhyme put it.

Mao decided that Lin, being next in line to the throne, was up to no
good.  Either Mao or Lin, or both, took action to save their own power
and life.

My village was given the official version of events by the commune soon
afterward.  The news meant nothing to the peasants.  They hardly even
knew Lin's name, but I received the news with blinding joy.  Not having
been able to challenge Mao in my mind, I blamed Lin for the Cultural
Revolution.  The evident rift between him and Mao meant, I thought,
that Mao had repudiated the Cultural Revolution, and would put an end
to all the misery, and destruction.  The demise of Lin in a way
reaffirmed my faith in Mao.  Many people shared my optimism because
there were signs that the Cultural Revolution was going to be reversed.
Almost immediately some capitalist-roaders started to be rehabilitated
and released from the camps.

My father was told the news about Lin in mid November  At once, the
occasional smile appeared on the faces of some Rebels.  At the
meetings, he was asked to sit down, which was unprecedented, and
'expose Yeh Chun' - Mme Lin Biao, who had been a colleague of his in
Yan'an in the early 194os.  My father said nothing.

But although his colleagues were being rehabilitated, and leaving the
camp in droves, my father was told by the camp commandant: "Don't you
assume you can get off the hook now."  His offense against Mao was
considered too serious.

His health had been deteriorating under the combination of intolerable
mental and physical pressure, with years of brutal beatings followed by
hard physical labor under atrocious conditions.  For nearly five years
he had been taking large doses of tranquilizers in order to keep
himself under control.  Sometimes he consumed up to twenty times the
normal dose, and this had worn out his system.  He felt crippling pains
somewhere in his body all the time; he began to cough blood, and was
frequently short of breath, accompanied by severe dizzy spells.  At the
age of fifty, he looked like a seventy-year-old.  The doctors in the
camp always greeted him with cold faces and impatient prescriptions of
more tranquilizers; they refused to give him a checkup, or even to hear
him out.  And each trip to the clinic would be followed by a barked
lecture from some of the Rebels: "Don't imagine you can get away with
faking illness!"

Jin-ming was in the camp at the end of 197 x. He was so worried about
Father that he stayed ore until the spring of 1972.  Then he got a
letter from his production team ordering him to return immediately, or
he would not be allocated any food at harvest time.  The day he was
leaving, my father went with him to the train a railway line had just
come to Miyi because of the strategic industries relocated to Xichang.
During the long walk, they were both silent.  Then Father had a sudden
attack of breathlessness and Jin-ming had to help him sit down by the
side of the road.  For a long time Father struggled to catch his
breath.

Then Jin-ming heard him sigh deeply and say, "It looks as though I
probably don't have long to live.  Life seems to be a dream."  Jin-ming
had never heard him talk about death.

Startled, he tried to comfort him.  But Father said slowly, "I ask
myself whether I am afraid of death.  I don't think I am.  My life as
it is now is worse.  And it looks as if there is not going to be any
ending.  Sometimes I feel weak: I stand by Tranquillity River and
think, Just one leap and I can get it over with.  Then I tell myself I
must not.  If I die without being cleared, there will be no end of
trouble for all of you .... I have been thinking a lot lately.  I had a
hard childhood, and society was full of injustice.  It was for a fair
society that I joined the Communists.  I've tried my best through the
years.  But what good has it done for the people?  As for myself, why
is it that in the end I have come to be the ruin of my family?  People
who believe in retribution say that to end badly you must have
something

My Parents in Camps 59 l on your conscience.  I have been thinking hard
about the things I've done in my life.  I have given orders to execute
some people..."

Father went on to tell Jin-ming about the death sentences he had
signed, the names and stories of the e-ba ('ferocious despots') in the
land reform in Chaoyang, and the bandit chiefs in Yibin.

"But these people had done so much evil that God himself would have had
them killed.

What, then, have I done wrong to deserve all this?"

After a long pause, Father said, "If I die like this, don't believe in
the Communist Party anymore."

25.  "The Fragrance of

(197~- 1975)

It was with deaths, love, torment, and respite that 1969, 197O, and
197i passed.  In Miyi, the dry and rainy seasons followed hard on each
other's heels.  On Buffalo Boy Flatland the moon waxed and waned, the

but the most important reason was that my father had not been
rehabilitated, unlike most capitalist-roaders.

Mao had sanctioned the mass rehabilitation not because he had at last
come to his senses, but because, with the death of Lin Biao and the
inevitable purge of his men, Mao had lost the hand with which he had
controlled the army.  He had removed and alienated virtually all the
other marshals, who opposed the Cultural Revolution, and had had to
rely almost solely on Lin.  He had put his wife, relatives, and stars
of the Cultural Revolution in important army posts, but these people
had no military record, and therefore received no allegiance from the
army.  With Lin gone, Mao had to turn to those purged leaders who still
commanded the loyalty of the army, including Deng Xiaoping, who was
soon to reemerge.  The first concession Mao had to make was to bring
back most of the denounced officials.

Mao also knew that his power depended on a functioning economy.  His
Revolutionary Committees were hopelessly divided and second-rate, and
could not get the country moving.  He had no choice but to turn to the
old, disgraced officials again.

My father was still in Miyi, but the part of his salary which had been
held back since June 1968 was returned to him, and we suddenly found
ourselves with what seemed to us an astronomical sum in the bank.  Our
personal belongings that had been taken away by the Rebels in the house
raids were all returned, the only exception being two bottles of
mao-tai, the most sought-after liquor in China.

There were other encouraging signs.  Zhou Enlai, who now had increased
power, set about getting the economy going.  The old administration was
largely restored, and production and order were emphasized.  Incentives
were reintroduced.  Peasants were allowed some cash sidelines.
Scientific research began again.  Schools started

594 "The Fragrance of Sweet Wind' proper teaching, after a gap of six
years; and my youngest brother, Xiao-fang, belatedly started his
schooling at the age of ten.

With the economy reviving, factories began to recruit new workers.  As
part of the incentive system, they were allowed to give priority to
their employees' children who had been sent to the country.  Though my
parents were not factory employees, my mother spoke to the managers of
a machinery factory that had formerly come under her Eastern District,
and now belonged to the Second Bureau of Light Industry in Chengdu.
They readily agreed to take me on.  So, a few months before my
twentieth birthday, I left Deyang for good.  My sister had to stay,
because young people from the cities who married after going to the
country were banned from returning, even if their spouses had city
registrations.

Becoming a worker was my only option.  Most universities were still
shut, and there were no other careers available.  Being in a factory
meant working only eight hours a day compared with the peasant's
dawn-to-dusk day.  There were no heavy loads to carry, and I could live
with my family.  But the most important thing was getting back my city
registration, which meant guaranteed food and other basics from the
state.

The factory was in the eastern suburbs of Chengdu, about forty-five
minutes by bicycle from home.  For much of the way I rode along the
bank of the Silk River, then along muddy country roads through fields
of rapeseed and wheat.  Finally I reached a shabby-looking enclosure
dotted with piles of bricks and rusting rolled steel.  This was my
factory.  It was a rather primitive enterprise, with some machines
dating back to the turn of the century.  After five years of
denunciation meetings, wall slogans, and physical bat ties between the
factions in the factory, the managers and engineers had just been put
back to work and it had begun to resume producing machine tools.  The
workers gave me a special welcome, largely on account of my

A New Lift with The Electricians' Manual 595 parents: the
destructiveness of the Cultural Revolution had made them hanker for the
old administration, under which there had been order and stability.

I was assigned as an apprentice in the foundry, under a woman whom
everyone called "Auntie Wei."  She had been very poor as a child, and
had not even had a decent pair of trousers when she was a teenager. Her
life had changed when the Communists came, and she was immensely
grateful to them.  She joined the Party, and at the beginning of the
Cultural Revolution she was among the Loyalists who defended the old
Party officials.  When Mao openly backed the Rebels, her group was
beaten into surrender and she was tortured.  A good friend of hers, an
old worker who also owed much to the Communists, died after being hung
horizontally by his wrists and ankles (a torture called 'duck
swimming').  Auntie Wei told me the story of her life in tears, and
said that her fate was tied to that of the Party, which she considered
had been wrecked by 'anti-Party elements' like Lin Biao.  She treated
me like a daughter, primarily because I came from a Communist family. I
felt uneasy with her because I could not match her faith in the
Party.

There were about thirty men and women doing the same job as me, ramming
earth into molds.  The incandescent, bubbling molten iron was lifted
and poured into the molds, generating a mass of sparkling white-hot
stars.  The hoist over our workshop creaked so alarmingly that I was
always worded it might drop the crucible of boiling liquid iron onto
the people ramming away underneath.

My job as a caster was dirty and hard.  I had swollen arms from
pounding the earth into the molds, but I was in high spirits, as I
naively believed that the Cultural Revolution was coming to an end.  I
threw myself into my work with an ardor that would have surprised the
peasants in Deyang.

In spite of my newfound enthusiasm, I was relieved to hear after a
month that I was going to be transferred.  I

could not have sustained ramming eight hours a day for long.  Owing to
the goodwill toward my parents, I was given several jobs to choose from
lathe operator, hoist operator, telephone operator, carpenter, or
electrician.  I dithered between the last two.  I liked the idea of
being able to create lovely wooden things, but decided that I did not
have talented hands.  As an electrician, I would have the glamour of
being the only woman in the factory doing the job.  There had been one
woman in the electricians' team, but she was leaving for another post.
She had always attracted great admiration.  When she climbed to the top
of the electric poles people would stop to marvel.  I struck up an
immediate friendship with this woman, who told me something which made
up my mind for me: electricians did not have to stand by a machine
eight hours a day.  They could stay in their quarters waiting to be
called out on a job.  That meant I would have time to myself to read.

I received five electric shocks in the first month.  Like being a
barefoot doctor, there was no formal training: the result of Mao's
disdain for education.  The six men in the team taught me patiently,
but I started at an abysmally low level.  I did not even know what a
fuse was.  The woman electrician gave me her copy of The Electricians'
Manual and I plunged into it, but still came out confusing electric
current with voltage.  In the end, I felt ashamed of wasting the other
electricians' time, and tried to copy what they did without
understanding much of the theory.  I managed fairly well, and gradually
was able to do some repairs on my own.

One day a worker reported a faulty switch on a power distribution
board.  I went to the back of the board to examine the wiring, and
decided a screw must have come loose.

Instead of switching off the electric supply first, I impetuously poked
my mains-tester cure screwdriver at the screw.

The back of the board was a net of wires, connections, and joints
carrying 380 volts of power.  Once inside this mine field, I had to
push my screwdriver extremely carefully

A New Li/?  with The Electricians' Manual 597 through a gap.  I reached
the screw, only to find it was not loose after all.  By then my arm had
started to shake slightl~ from being taut and nervous.  I began to pull
it back, holding my breath.  Right at the very edge, just as I was
about to relax, a series of colossal jolts shot through my right hand
and down to my feet.  I leaped in the air, and the screwdriver sprang
out of my hand.  It had touched a joint at the entrance to the power
distribution network.  I sagged onto the floor, thinking I could have
been killed if the screwdriver had slipped a lit He earlier.  I did not
tell the other electricians, as I did not want them to feel they had to
go on calls with me.

I got used to the shocks.  No one else made a fuss about them, either.
One old electrician told me that before 1949, when the factory was
privately owned, he had had to use the back of his hand to test the
current.  It was only under the Communists that the factory was obliged
to buy the electricians mains-testers.

There were two rooms in our quarters, and when they were not out on a
call, most of the electricians would play cards in the outer room while
I read in the inner room.  In Mao's China, failure to join the people
around you was criticized as 'cutting oneself off from the masses," and
at first I was nervous about going off on my own to read.  I would put
my book down as soon as one of the other electricians came inside, and
would try to chat with him in a somewhat awkward manner.  As a result
they seldom came in.  I was enormously relieved that they did not
object to my eccentricity.  Rather, they went out of their way not to
disturb me.  Because they were so nice to me I volunteered to do' as
many repairs as possible.

One young electrician in the team, Day, had been in a high school until
the start of the Cultural Revolution, and was considered very well
educated.  He was a good calligrapher and played several musical
instruments beautifully.  I was very attracted to him, and in the
mornings I would always find him leaning against the door to the
electricians'

quarters, waiting to greet me.  I found myself doing a lot of calls
with him.  One early spring day, after finishing a maintenance job, we
spent the lunch break leaning against a haystack at the back of the
foundry, enjoying the first sunny day of the year.  Sparrows were
chirping over our heads, fighting for the grains left on the rice
plants.  The hay gave off an aroma of sunshine and earth.  I was
overjoyed to discover that Day shared my interest in classical Chinese
poetry, and that we could compose poems to each other using the same
rhyme sequence, as ancient Chinese poets had done.  In my generation,
few people understood or liked classical poetry.  We were very late
back to work that afternoon, but there were no criticisms.  The other
electricians only gave us meaningful smiles.

Soon Day and I were counting the minutes during our days off from the
factory, eager to be back together.  We sought every opportunity to be
near each other, to brush each other's fingers, to feel the excitement
of being close, to smell the smell of each other, and to look for
reasons to be hurt or pleased by each other's half-spoken words.

Then I began to hear gossip that Day was unworthy of me.  The
disapproval was partly caused by the fact that I was considered
special.  One of the reasons was that I was the only offspring of high
officials in the factory, and indeed the only one most of the workers
had ever come into contact with.  There had been many stories about
high officials' children being arrogant and spoiled.  I apparently came
as a nice surprise, and some workers seemed to feel that no one in the
factory could possibly be worthy of me.

They held it against Day that his father had been a Kuomintang officer,
and had been in a labor camp.  The workers were convinced I had a
bright future, and should not be 'dragged into misfortune' by being
associated with Day.

Actually, it was purely by chance that Day's father had

A New Lip with The Electricians' Manual 5Uo become a Kuomintang
officer.  In 1937, he and two friends were on their way to Yan'an to
join up with the Communists to fight the Japanese.  They had almost
reached Yan'an when they were stopped at a Kuomintang roadblock where
the officers urged them to join the Kuomintang instead.  While the two
friends insisted on pressing on to Yan'an, Day's father set fled for
the Kuomintang, thinking it did not matter which Chinese army he
joined, as long as it fought the Japanese.  When the civil war re
starred he and his two friends ended up on opposite sides.  After 1949,
he was sent to a labor camp, while his companions became high-ranking
officers in the Communist army.

Because of this accident of history, Day was sniped at in the factory
for not knowing his place by 'pestering' me, and even for being a
social climber.  I could see from his drained face and bitter smiles
that he was stung by the snide gossip, but he said nothing to me.  We
had only hinted at our feelings in allusions in our poems.  Now he
stopped writing poems to me.  The confidence with which he had begun
our friendship disappeared, and he adopted a subdued and humbled manner
toward me in private.  In public, he tried to appease the people who
disapproved of him by awkwardly trying to show them he really thought
nothing of me.  At times I felt that he behaved in such an undignified
way that I could not help being irritated as well as saddened.  Having
been brought up in a privileged position, I did not realize that in
China dignity was a luxury scarcely available to those who were not
privileged.  I did not appreciate Day's dilemma, and the fact that he
could not show his love for me, for fear of ruining me.  Gradually we
became alienated.

During the four months of our acquaintance, the word 'love' had never
been mentioned by either of us.  I had even suppressed it in my mind.
One could never let oneself go, because consideration of the vital
factor, family background, was ingrained in one's mind.  The
consequences of being tied to the family of a 'class enemy' like Day's
were

too serious.  Because of the subconscious self-censorship, I never
quite fell in love with Day.

During this period my mother had come off the cortisone, and had been
receiving treatment with Chinese medicines for her scleroderma.  We had
been scouring country markets for the weird ingredients prescribed for
her tortoiseshell, snake gallbladder, and anteater scales.  The doctors
recommended that as soon as the weather turned warmer, she should go to
see some top-class specialists in Peking for both her womb and the
scleroderma.  As part compensation for what she had suffered, the
authorities offered to send a companion with her.  My mother asked if I
could go.

We left in April 1972, staying with family friends, whom it was now
safe to contact.  My mother saw several gynecologists in Peking and
Tianjin, who diagnosed a benign tumor in her womb and recommended a
hysterectomy.

Meanwhile, they said her bleeding could be controlled if she had plenty
of rest and tried to keep cheerful.  The dermatologists thought that
the scleroderma might be localized, in which case it would not be
fatal.  My mother followed the doctors' advice and had a hysterectomy
the following year.  The scleroderma remained localized.

We visited many friends of my parents.  Everywhere we went, they were
being rehabilitated.  Some had just come out of prison.  Mao-tai and
other treasured liquors flowed freely, as did tears.  In almost every
family, one or more members had died as a result of the Cultural
Revolution.

The eighty-year-old mother of an old friend died after falling off a
landing where she had had to sleep, her family having been driven out
of their apartment.  Another friend struggled to hold back his tears
when he set eyes on me.

I reminded him of his daughter, who would have been my age.  She had
been sent with her school to a godforsaken place on the border with
Siberia, where she had become pregnant.  Frightened, she consulted a
back-street midwife

A New Lift with The Electricians' Manual 6ol who tied musk around her
waist and told her to jump over a wall to get rid of the baby.  She
died of a violent hemorrhage.  Tragic stories cropped up in every
household.  But we also talked about hope, and looked forward to
happier times ahead.

One day we went to see Tung, an old friend of my parents who had just
been released from prison.  He had been my mother's boss on her march
from Manchuria to Sichuan, and had become a bureau chief in the
Ministry of Public Security.  At the beginning of the Cultural
Revolution he was accused of being a Russian spy, and of having
supervised the installation of tape recorders in Mao's quarters which
he had apparently done, under orders.  Every word of Mao's was supposed
to be so precious it had to be preserved, but Mao spoke a dialect which
his secretaries found hard to understand, and in addition they were
sometimes sent out of the room.  In early 1967 Tung was arrested and
sent to the special prison for top people, Qjncheng.  He spent five
years in chains, in solitary confinement.  His legs were like
matchsticks, while from the hips up he was terribly bloated.  His wife
had been forced to denounce him, and had changed the surname of their
children from his to hers to demonstrate that they were cutting him off
forever.  Most of their household things, including his clothes, had
been taken away in house raids.  As a result of Lin Biao's downfall,
Tung's patron, a foe of Lin Biao's, was back in power, and Tung was
released from prison.

His wife was summoned back from her camp in the nor them border region
to be reunited with him.

On the day of his release, she brought him new clothes.

His first words to her were, "You shouldn't have just brought me
material goods.  You should have brought me spiritual food [meaning
Mao's works]."  Tung had been reading nothing but these during his five
years in solitary.

I was staying with his family at the time, and saw him making them
study Mao's articles every day, with a seriousness which I found more
tragic than ridiculous.

A few months after our visit Tung was sent to supervise a case in a
port in the south.  His long confinement had left him unfit for a
demanding job, and he soon had a heart attack.  The government
dispatched a special plane to take him to a hospital in Guangzhou.  The
lift in the hospital was not working, and he insisted on walking up
four floors because he considered being carried upstairs against
Communist morality.  He died on the operating table.  His family was
not with him because he had left word that 'they should not interrupt
their work."

It was while we were staying with Tung and his family at the end of May
1972 that my mother and I received a telegram saying my father had been
allowed to leave his camp.  After the fall of Lin Biao, the camp
doctors had at last given my father a diagnosis, saying that he was
suffering from dangerously high blood pressure, serious heart and liver
trouble, and vascular sclerosis.  They recommended a complete checkup
in Peking.

He took a train to Chengdu, and then flew to Peking.

Because there was no public transport to the airport for non passengers
my mother and I had to wait to meet him at the city terminal.  He was
thin and burned almost black by the sun.  It was the first time in
three and a half years that he had been out of the mountains of Miyi.
For the first few days he seemed at a loss in the big city, and would
refer to crossing the road as 'crossing the river' and taking a bus as
'taking a boat."  He walked hesitantly on the crowded streets and
looked somewhat baffled by all the traffic.  I assumed the role of his
guide.  We stayed with an old friend of his from Yibin who had also
suffered atrociously in the Cultural Revolution.

Apart from this man and Tung, my father did not visit anyone because he
had not been rehabilitated.  Unlike me, who was full of optimism, he
was heavy-hearted most of the lime.  To try to cheer him up, I dragged
him and my mother out sight-seeing in temperatures sometimes exceeding
xoo F. Once I half-forced him to go to the

A New LiE with The Electricians' Manual ~o3 Great Wall with me in a
crowded coach, choking with dust and sweat.  As I babbled away, he
listened with pensive smiles.  A baby in the arms of a peasant woman
sitting in front of us started crying, and she smacked it hard.  My
father shot up from his seat and yelled at her, "Don't you hit the
baby!"  I hurriedly pulled his sleeve and made him sit down.  The whole
coach stared at us.  It was most unusual for a Chinese to interfere in
a matter like this.  I thought with a sigh of how my father had changed
from the days when he had beaten Jin-ming and Xiao-her.

In Peking I also read books which opened new horizons for me. President
Nixon had visited China in February that year.  The official line was
that he had come 'with a white flag."  The idea that America was the
number-one enemy had by now vanished from my mind, together with much
of my indoctrination.  I was overjoyed that Nixon had come because his
visit helped generate a new climate in which some translations of
foreign books were becoming available.  They were marked 'for internal
circulation," which meant in theory that they were to be read only by
authorized personnel, but there were no rules specifying to whom they
should be circulated, and they passed freely between friends if one of
them had privileged access through their job.

I was able to lay my hands on some of these publications.

It was with unimaginable pleasure that I read Nixon's own Six Crises
(somewhat expurgated, of course, given his antiCommunist past), David
Halberstam's The Best and the Brightest, William L. Shirer's The Rise
and Fall of the Third Reich, and The Winds of War by Herman Wouk, with
their (to me) up-to-date picture of the outside world.  The
descriptions of the Kennedy administration in The Best and the
Brightest made me marvel at the relaxed atmosphere of the American
government, in contrast with my own so remote, frightening, and
secretive.  I was captivated by the style of writing in the nonfiction
works.  How cool and detached it was!  Even Nixon's Six Crises seemed a
model of calmness compared with the sledgehammer style of the Chinese
media, full of hectoring, denunciations, and assertions.  In The Winds
of War I was less impressed by its majestic descriptions of the times
than by its vignettes showing the uninhibited fuss that Western women
could make about their clothing, by their easy access to it and by the
range of colors and styles available.  At twenty, I had only a few
clothes, in the same style as everybody else, almost every piece blue,
gray, or white.  I closed my eyes and caressed in my imagination all
the beautiful dresses I had never seen or worn.

The increased availability of information from abroad was, of course,
part of the general liberalization after the downfall of Lin Biao, but
Nixon's visit gave it a convenient pretext the Chinese must not lose
face by showing themselves to be totally ignorant of America.  In those
days, every step in the process of relaxation had to be given some
farfetched political justification.  Learning English was now a worthy
cause for 'winning friends from all over the world' and was therefore
no longer a crime.  So as not to alarm or frighten our distinguished
guest, streets and restaurants lost the militant names that had been
imposed on them at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution by the Red
Guards.  In Chengdu, although it was not visited by Nixon, the
restaurant The Whiff of Gunpowder switched back to its old name, The
Fragrance of Sweet Wind.

I was in Peking for five months.  Whenever I was alone, I thought of
Day.  We did not write to each other.  I composed poems to him, but
kept them to myself.  Eventually, my hope for the future conquered my
regrets about the past.

One piece of news in particular overshadowed all my other thoughts for
the first time since I was fourteen I saw the possibility of a future I
had not dared to dream about: I might be able to go to college.  In
Peking, small numbers of students had been enrolled in the previous
couple of years, and it looked as though universities all over the
country would be opening soon.  Zhou Enlai was emphasizing a quote by
Mao to the effect that universities were still needed, particularly for
science and techno log I could not wait to get back to Chengdu to start
studying to try t~ get in.

I returned to the factory in September ~972, and sa,a Day without too
much pain.  He had also become calm, only occasionally revealing a
glimpse of melancholy.  We were good friends again, but we no longer
talked about poetry.  I buried myself in my preparations for a
universin' course, although I had no idea which.  It was not up to me
to choose, as Mao had said that 'education must be thoroughly
revolutionized."  This meant, among other things, that university
students were to be assigned to courses with no consideration for what
they were interested in that would be individualism, a capitalist vice.
I began to study all the major subjects: Chinese, math, physics,
chemistry, biology, and English.

Mao had also decreed that students were not to come from the
traditional source middle-school graduates but had to be workers or
peasants.  This suited me, as I had been a genuine peasant and was now
a worker.

There was to be an entrance exam, Zhou Enlai had decided, although he
had to change the term 'exam' (kaoshO to 'an investigation into the
candidates' situation of handling some basic knowledge, and their
ability to analyze and solve concrete problems," a criterion based on
another Mao quote.  Mao did not like exams.  The new procedure was that
first one had to be recommended by one's work unit, then came entrance
examinations, then the enrollment authorities weighed the exam results
and the applicant's 'political behavior."

For nearly ten months I spent all my evenings and weekends, and much of
my time at the factory as well, poring over textb9oks that had survived
the flames of the Red Guards.  They came from many friends.  I also had
a network of tutors who gave up their evenings and holidays happily and
enthusiastically.  People who loved learning felt a rapport which bound
them together.  This was the reaction from a nation with a highly
sophisticated civilization which had been subjected to virtual
extinction.

In spring 1973, Deng Xiaoping was rehabilitated and appointed
vice-premier, the de facto deputy to the ailing Zhou Enlai.  I was
thrilled.  Deng's comeback seemed to me a sure sign that the Cultural
Revolution was being reversed.  He was known to be dedicated to
construction rather than destruction, and was an excellent
administrator.  Mao had sent him away to a tractor factory in relative
security to keep him in reserve in case of Zhou Enlai's demise.  No
matter how power-crazed, Mao was always careful not to burn his
bridges.

I was delighted at Deng's rehabilitation for personal reasons as well.
I had known his stepmother very well when I was a child, and his
half-sister was our neighbor for years in the compound we all called
her "Auntie Deng."  She and her husband had been denounced simply
because they were related to Deng, and the compound residents who had
fawned over her before the Cultural Revolution shunned her.  But my
family greeted her as usual.  At the same time, she was one of the very
few people in the compound who would tell my family how they admired my
father at the height of his persecution.  In those days even a nod, or
a fleeting smile, was rare and precious, and our two families developed
very warm feelings for each other.

In the summer of 1973, university enrollment started.  I felt as if I
was awaiting a sentence of life or death.  One place in the Foreign
Languages Department at Sichuan University was allocated to the Second
Bureau of Light Industry in Chengdu, which had twenty-three factories
under it, mine being one of them.  Each of the factories had to
nominate one candidate to sit for exams.  In my factory there were
several hundred workers, and six people applied, including me.  An
election was held to select the candidate, and I was chosen by four of
the factory's five workshops.

In my own workshop there was another candidate, a friend of mine who
was nineteen.  Both of us were popular, but our work mates could only
vote for one of us.  Her name was read out first; there was an awkward
stirring it was clear that people could not decide what to do.  I was
miserable in the extreme if there were a lot of votes for her, there
would be fewer for me.  Suddenly she stood up and said with a smile,
"I'd like to forgo my candidacy and vote for Chang Jung.  I'm two years
younger than she is.  I'll try next year."  The workers burst out in
relieved laughter, and promised to vote for her next year.  And they
did.  She went to the university in 1974.

I was hugely moved by her gesture, and also by the outcome of the vote.
It was as if the workers were helping me to achieve my dreams.  My
family background did not hurt, either.  Day did not apply: he knew he
had no chance.

I took the Chinese, math, and English exams.  I was so nervous the
night before that I could not sleep.  When I came home for the lunch
break, my sister was waiting for me.  She massaged my head gently, and
I fell into a light snooze.  The papers were very elementary, and
scarcely touched on my assiduously imbibed geometry, trigonometry,
physics, and chemistry.  I got honors in all my papers, and for my
English oral I got the highest mark of all the candidates in Chengdu.

Before I could relax, there came a crushing blow.  On 20 July an
article appeared in the People's Daily about a 'blank exam paper."
Unable to answer the questions in his university entrance papers, an
applicant called Zhang Tie-sheng, who had been sent to the countryside
near Jinzhou, had handed in a blank sheet, along with a letter
complaining that the exams were tantamount to a 'capitalist
restoration."  His letter was seized on by Mao's nephew and personal
aide, Mao Yuanxin, who was running the province.  Mme Mao and her
cohorts condemned the emphasis on academic standards as 'bourgeois
dictatorship."

"What does it matter even if the whole country becomes illiterate?"
they declared.

"What matters is that the Cultural Revolution achieves the greatest
miumph!"

The exams I had taken were declared void.  Entrance to universities was
now to be decided solely by 'political behavior."  How that should be
measured became a big question.  The recommendation from my factory had
been written after a 'collective appraisal meeting' of the
electricians' team.  Day had drafted it and my former female
electrician master had polished it.  It made me out to be an absolute
paragon, the most model worker that ever existed.

I had no doubt that the other twenty-two candidates had exactly the
same credentials.  There was therefore no way to differentiate between
us.

The official propaganda was not much help.  One widely publicized
'hero' shouted, "You ask me for my qualification for university?  My
qualification is this!"  at which he raised his hands and pointed at
his calluses.  But we all had calluses on our hands.  We had all been
in factories, and most had worked on farms.

There was only one alternative: the back door.

Most directors of the Sichuan Enrollment Committee were old colleagues
of my father's who had been rehabilitated, and they admired his courage
and integrity.  But, much though he wanted me to have a university
education, my father would not ask them to help.

"It would not be fair to people with no power," he said.

"What would our country become if things had to be done this way?"  I
started to argue with him, and ended up in tears.  I must have looked
truly heartbroken, because eventually he said, with a pained face.

"All right, I'll do it."

I took his arm and we walked to a hospital about a mile away where one
of the directors of the Enrollment Committee was having a checkup:
nearly all victims of the Cultural Revolution suffered appalling health
as a result of their ordeals.  My father walked slowly, with the help
of a stick.  His old energy and sharpness had disappeared.

Watching him shuffling along, stopping to rest every now and then,
battling with his mind as well as his legs, I wanted to say "Let's go
back."  But I also desperately wanted to get into the university.

On the hospital grounds we sat on the edge of a low stone bridge to
rest.  My father looked in torment.  Eventually he said, "Would you
forgive me?  I really find it very difficult to do this .... For a
second I felt a surge of resentment, and wanted to cry out at him that
there was no fairer alternative.  I wanted to tell him how much I had
dreamed of going to the university, and that I deserved it for my hard
work, for my exam results, and because I had been elected.  But I knew
my father knew all this.  And it was he who had given me my thirst for
knowledge.  Still, he had his principles, and because I loved him I had
to accept him as he was, and understand his dilemma of being a moral
man living in a land which was a moral void.  I held back my tears and
said, "Of course."  We trudged back home in silence.

How lucky I was to have my resourceful mother!  She went to the wife of
the head of the Enrollment Committee, who then spoke to her husband. My
mother also went to see the other chiefs, and got them to back me. She
emphasized my exam results, which she knew would be the clincher for
these former capitalist-roaders.  In October 1973, I entered the
Foreign Languages Depa~unent of Sichuan University in Chengdu to study
English.

20.  "Sniffing after Foreigners' Farts and Calling Them Sweet'-Learning
English in Mao's Wake

(1971-1974)

Since her return from Peking in autumn 1972, helping her five children
had been my mother's major occupation.

My youngest brother, Xiao-fang, then aged ten, needed daily coaching to
make up for his missed school years, and the future of her other
children depended largely on her.

With the society half paralyzed for over six years, an enormous number
of social problems had been created, and simply left unsolved.  One of
the most serious was the many millions of young people who had been
sent to the countryside and who were desperate to come back to the
cities.  After the demise of Lin Biao it began to be possible for some
to get back, partly because the state needed labor for the urban
economy, which it was now trying to revitalize.  But the government
also had to put strict limits on the number who could return because it
was state policy in China to control the population of the cities: the
state took it on itself to guarantee the urban population food,
housing, and jobs.

So competition for the limited 'return tickets' was fierce.

The state created regulations to keep the number down.

Marriage was one criterion for exclusion.  Once married, no
organization in the city would take you.  It was on these grounds that
my sister was disqualified from applying for a job in the city, or to a
university, which were the only legitimate ways to get back to Chengdu.
She was extremely miserable, as she wanted to join her husband; his
factory had started working normally again, and as a result he could
not go to Deyang and live with her, except for the official 'marriage
leave' of just twelve days a year.  Her only chance of getting to
Chengdu was to obtain a certificate that said she had an incurable
disease which was what many like her were doing.  So my mother had to
help her get one from a doctor Mend which said Xiao-hong suffered from
cirrhosis of the liver.  She came back to Chengdu at the end of 197z.

The way to get things done now was through personal connections.  There
were people coming to see my mother every day schoolteachers, doctors,
nurses, actors, and minor officials appealing for help to get their
children out of the countryside.  Often she was their only hope,
although she had no job, and she pulled strings on their behalf with
unflagging energy.  My father would not help;

he was too set in his ways to start 'fixing."

Even when the official channel worked, the personal connection was
still essential to make sure things went smoothly and to avoid
potential disaster.  My brotherJin-ming got out of his village in March
1972.  Two organizations were recruiting new workers from his commune:
one was a factory in his county town making electrical appliances, the
other an unspecified enterprise in the Western District of Chengdu.
Jin-ming wanted to get back to Chengdu, but my mother made inquiries
among her friends in the Western District and found out that the job
was in a slaughterhouse.

Jin-ming immediately withdrew his application and went to work in the
local factory instead.

It was in fact a large plant which had relocated from Shanghai in 1966
as part of Mao's plan to conceal industry in the mountains of Sichuan
against an American or Soviet attack.  Jin-ming impressed his fellow
workers with his hard work and fairness, and in 1973 he was one of four
young people elected by the factory to attend a university, out of 200
applicants.  He passed his exam papers brilliantly and effortlessly.
But because Father had not been rehabilitated, my mother had to make
sure that when the university came to do the obligatory 'political
investigation' they would not be scared off, and would instead get the
impression that he was about to be cleared.  She also had to ensure
that Jin-ming was not pushed out by some failed applicant with powerful
connections.  In October 1973, when I went to Sichuan University,
Jin-ming was admitted to the Engineering College of Central China at
Wuhan to study casting.

He would have preferred to do physics, but he was in seventh heaven
anyway.

While Jin-ming and I had been preparing to try to get into a
university, my second brother, Xiao-her, was living in a state of
despondency.  The basic qualification for university entrance was that
one had to have been either a worker, a peasant, or a soldier, and he
had been none of these.  The government was still expelling urban youth
en masse to the rural areas, and this was the only future facing him
except joining the armed forces.  Dozens applied for every place, and
the only way in was via connections.

My mother got Xiao-her in in December 1972, against almost impossible
odds, as my father had not been cleared.

Xiao-her was assigned to an air force college in northern China, and
after three months' basic training became a radio operator.  He worked
five hours a day, in a supremely leisurely manner, and spent the rest
of the time in 'political studies' and producing food.

In the 'studies' sessions everyone claimed they had joined the armed
forces 'to follow the Party's command, to protect the people, to
safeguard the motherland."  But

Learning English in Mao's 14like 613 there were more pertinent reasons.
The young men from the cities wanted to avoid being sent to the
countryside, and those from the country hoped to use the army as a
springboard to leap into the city.  For peasants from poor areas, being
in the armed forces meant at least a better filled stomach.

As the 197os unfolded, joining the Party, like joining the army, became
increasingly unrelated to ideological commitment.  Everyone said in
their applications that the Party was 'great, glorious, and correct,"
and that 'to join the Party means to devote my life to the most
splendid cause of mankind the liberation of the world proletariat."

But for most the real reason was personal advantage.  This was the
obligatory step to becoming an officer; and when an officer was
discharged he automatically became a 'state official," with a secure
salary, prestige, and power, not to mention a city registration.  A
private had to go back to his village and become a peasant again. Every
year before discharge time there would be stories of suicides,
breakdowns, and depressions.

One evening Xiao-her was sitting with about a thousand soldiers and
officers, and the officers' families, watching an open-air movie.

Suddenly submachine-gun fire crackled out, followed by a huge
explosion.  The audience scattered, screaming.

The shots came from a guard who was about to be discharged and sent
back to his village, having failed to get into the Party and thus to be
promoted to officer grade.

First he shot dead the commissar of his company, whom he held
responsible for blocking his promotion, and then he fired at random
into the crowd, tossing a hand grenade.

Five more people were killed, all women and children from officers'
families.  Over a dozen were wounded.  He then fled into a residential
block, where he was besieged by fellow soldiers, who shouted at him
through megaphones to surrender.  But the moment the guard fired out of
the window, they broke and ran, to the amusement of the

6I4 "Sniffing after Foreigners' Farts..."

hundreds of excited onlookers.  Finally, a special unit arrived.  After
a fierce exchange of fire, they broke into the apartment and found the
guard had committed suicide.

Like everyone else around him, Xiao-her wanted to get into the Party.
It was not such a matter of life and death for him as for the peasant
soldiers, since he knew he would not have to go to the countryside
after his military career.

The rule was that you went back to where you came from, so he would
automatically be given a job in Chengdu whether he was a Party member
or not.  But the job would be better if he was a Party member.  He
would also have more access to information, which was important to him,
since China at the time was an intellectual desert, with almost nothing
to read apart from the crudest propaganda.

Besides these practical considerations, par was never absent.  For many
people, joining the Party was rather like taking out an insurance
policy.  Party membership meant you were less distrusted, and this
sense of relative security was very comforting.  What was more, in an
extremely political environment like the one Xiao-her was in, if he did
not want to join the Party it would be noted in his personal file and
suspicion would follow him: "Why does he not want to join the Party?"
To apply and not be accepted was also likely to give rise to suspicion:
"Why was he not accepted?  There must be something wrong with him."

Xiao-her had been reading Marxist classics with genuine interest they
were the only books available, and he needed something to satisfy his
intellectual thirst.  Because the Communist Party charter stated that
studying Marxism-Leninism was the first qualification for being a Party
member, he thought he could combine his interest with practical gain.
But neither his bosses nor his comrades were impressed.  In fact, they
felt shown up because, coming mostly from peasant backgrounds and being
semiliterate, they could not understand Marx.  Xiao-her was criticized
for being arrogant and cutting himself off from the masses.  If he
wanted to join the Party, he would have to find another way.

The most important thing, he soon realized, was to please his immediate
bosses.  The next was to please his comrades.  In addition to being
popular and working hard at his job, he had to 'serve the people' in
the most literal sense.

Unlike most armies, which assign unpleasant and menial tasks to the
lower ranks, the Chinese army operated by waiting for people to
volunteer for jobs like fetching water for morning ablutions and
sweeping the grounds.  Reveille was at 6:3o a.m.; the 'honored task' of
getting up before this fell to those who aspired to join the Party. And
there were so many of them they fought each other for the brooms. In
order to secure a broom, people got up earlier and earlier.  One
morning Xiao-her heard someone sweeping the grounds just after 4 a.m.

There were other important chores, and the one which counted most was
helping to produce food.  The basic food allowance was very small, even
for officers.  There was meat only once a week.  So every company had
to grow its own grain and vegetables and raise its own pigs.  At
harvest time the company commissar would often deliver pep talks:

"Comrades, now is the time of testing by the Party!  We must finish the
whole field by this evening!  Yes, the work needs ten times the
manpower we have.  But every one of us revolutionary fighters can do
the job of ten men!

Communist Party members must take a leading role.  For those who want
to join the Party, this is the best time to prove yourselves!  Those
who have passed the test will be able to join the Party on the
battlefield at the end of the day!"

Party members did have to work hard to fulfill their 'leading role,"
but it was the aspiring applicants who really had to exert themselves.
On one occasion, Xiao-her became so exhausted that he collapsed in the
middle of a
field.  While the new members who had earned 'battlefield enrollment'
raised their right fists and gave the standard pledge 'to fight all my
life for the glorious Communist cause," Xiao-her was taken to a
hospital, where he had to stay for days.

The most direct path to the company had several dozen of unequaled
place in the hearts

Party was raising pigs.  The these, and they occupied an of the
soldiers; officers and men alike would hang around the pigsty,
observing, commenting, and willing the animals to grow.  If the pigs
were doing well, the swine herds were the darlings of the company, and
there were many contestants for this profession.

Xiao-her became a full-time swineherd.  It was hard, filthy work, not
to mention the psychological pressure.

Every night he and his colleagues took turns to get up in the small
hours to give the pigs an extra feed.  When a sow produced piglets they
kept watch night after night in case she crushed them.  Precious
soybeans were carefully picked, washed, ground, strained, made into
'soybean milk," and lovingly fed to the mother to stimulate her milk.

Life in the air force was very unlike what Xiao-her had imagined.
Producing food took up more than a third of the entire time he was in
the military.  At the end of a year's arduous pig raising, Xiao-her was
accepted into the Party.

Like many others, he put his feet up and began to take it easy.

After membership in the Party, everyone's ambition was to become an
officer; whatever advantage the former brought, the latter doubled it.
Getting to be an officer depended on being picked by one's superiors,
so the key was never to displease them.  One day Xiao-her was summoned
to see one of the college's political commissars.

Xiao-her was on tenterhooks, not knowing whether he was in for some
unexpected good fortune or total disaster.  The commissar, a plump man
in his fifties with puffy eyes and a loud, commanding voice, looked
exceedingly benign as he lit up a cigarette and asked Xiao-her about
his family background, age, and state of health.  He also asked whether
he had a fiance to which Xiao-her replied that he did not.  It struck
Xiao-her as a good sign that the man was being so personal.  The
commissar went on to praise him: "You have studied Marxism-Leninism-Mao
Zedong Thought conscientiously.  You have worked hard.  The masses have
a good impression of you.  Of course, you must keep on being modest;
modesty makes you progress," and so on.  By the time the commissar
stubbed out his cigarette, Xiao-her thought his promotion was in his
pocket.

The commissar lit a second cigarette and began to tell a story about a
fire in a cotton mill, and about a woman spinner who had been severely
burned dashing back in to rescue 'state property."  In fact, all her
limbs had had to be amputated, so that there was only a head and a
torso left, although, the commissar stressed, her face had not been
destroyed, or more important her ability to produce babies.  She was,
said the commissar, a heroine, and was going to be publicized on a
grand scale in the press.  The Party would like to grant all her
wishes, and she had said that she wanted to marry an air force officer.
Xiao-her was young, handsome, unattached, and could be made an officer
at any time .... Xiao-her sympathized with the lady, but marrying her
was another matter.  But how could he refuse the commissar?  He could
not produce any convincing reasons.  Love?

Love was supposed to be bound up with 'class feelings," and who could
deserve more class feelings than a Communist heroine?  Saying he did
not know her would not get him off the hook either.  Many marriages in
China had been the result of an arrangement by the Party.  As a Party
member, particularly one hoping to become an officer, Xiao-her was
supposed to say: "I resolutely obey the Party's decision!"  He bitterly
regretted having said he had no fiance.  His mind was racing to think
of a way to say no tactfully as the commissar went on about the
advantages:

immediate promotion to officer, publicity as a hero, a fulltime nurse,
and a large allowance for life.

The commissar lit yet another cigarette, and paused.

Xiao-her weighed his words.  Taking a calculated risk, he asked if this
was already an irreversible Party decision.  He knew the Party always
preferred people to 'volunteer."  As he expected, the commissar said
no: it was up to Xiao-her.

Xiao-her decided to bluff his way through: he 'confessed' that although
he did not have a fiancte, his mother had arranged a girlfriend for
him.  He knew this girlfriend had to be good enough to knock out the
heroine, and this meant possessing two attributes: the right class
background and good works in that order.  So she became the daughter of
the commander of a big army region, and worked in an army hospital.
They had just begun 'talking about love."

The commissar backed off, saying he had only wanted to see how Xiao-her
felt, and had no intention of forcing a match on him.  Xiao-her was not
punished, and not long afterward he became an officer and was put in
charge of a ground radio communications unit.  A young man from a
peasant background came forward to marry the disabled heroine.

Meanwhile, Mme Mao and her cohorts were renewing their efforts to
prevent the country from working.  In industry, their slogan was: "To
stop production is revolution itself."  In agriculture, in which they
now began to meddle seriously: "We would rather have socialist weeds
than capitalist crops."  Acquiring foreign technology became 'sniffing
after foreigners' farts and calling them sweet."  In education: "We
want illiterate working people, not educated spiritual aristocrats."
They called for schoolchildren to rebel against their teachers again;
in January 1974, classroom windows, tables, and chairs in schools in
Peking were smashed, as in 1966.  Mme Mao claimed this was like 'the

Learning English in Mao's 14ake 610 revolutionary action of English
workers destro~4ng machines in the eighteenth century."  All this
demagogueD' had one purpose: to create trouble for Zhou Enlai and Deng
Xiaoping and generate chaos.  It was only in persecuting people and in
destruaion that Mme Mao and the other luminaries of the Cultural
Revolution had a chance to 'shine."  In construaion they had no
place.

Zhou and Deng had been making tentative efforts to open the country up,
so Mme Mao launched a fresh attack on foreign culture.  In early 1974
there was a big media campaign denouncing the Italian director
Michelangelo Antonioni for a film he had made about China, although no
one in China had seen the film, and few had even heard of it or of
Antonioni.  This xenophobia was extended to Beethoven after a visit by
the Philadelphia Orchestra.

In the two years since the fall of Lin Biao, my mood had changed from
hope to despair and fury.  The only source of comfort was that there
was a fight going on at all, and that the lunacy was not reigning
supreme, as it had in the earlier years of the Cultural Revolution.
During this period, Mao was not giving his full backing to either
side.

He hated the efforts of Zhou and Deng to reverse the Cultural
Revolution, but he knew that his wife and her acolytes could not make
the country work.

Mao let Zhou carry on with the administration of the country, but set
his wife upon Zhou, particularly in a new campaign to 'criticize
Confucius."  The slogans ostensibly denounced Lin Biao, but were really
aimed at Zhou, who, it was widely held, epitomized the virtues
advocated by the ancient sage.  Even though Zhou had been unwaveringly
loyal, Mao still could not leave him alone.  Not even now, when Zhou
was fatally ill with advanced cancer of the bladder.

It was in this period that I started to realize that it was Mao who was
really responsible for the Cultural Revolution.  But I still did not
condemn him explicitly, even in my own mind.  It was so difficult to
destroy a god!  But,

psychologically, I was ripe for his name to be spelled out for me.

Education became the front line of the sabotage by Mme Mao and her
cabal, because it was not immediately vital to the economy and because
every attempt at learning and teaching involved a reversal of the
glorified ignorance of the Cultural Revolution.  When I entered the
university, I found myself in a battlefield.

Sichuan University had been the headquarters of 26 August, the Rebel
group that had been the task force of the Tings, and the buildings were
pockmarked with scars from the seven years of the Cultural Revolution.
Scarcely a window was intact.  The pond in the middle of the campus,
once renowned for its elegant lotuses and goldfish, was now a stinking,
mosquito-breeding swamp.  The French plane trees which lined the avenue
leading from the main gate had been mutilated.

The moment I entered the university a political campaign started up
against 'going through the back door."  Of course, there was no mention
of the fact that it was the Cultural Revolution leaders themselves who
had blocked the 'front door."  I could see that there were a lot of
high officials' children among the new 'worker-peasant-soldier'
students, and that virtually all the rest had connections the peasants
with their production team leaders or commune secretaries, the workers
with their factory bosses, if they were not petty officials themselves.
The 'back door' was the only way in.  My fellow students demonstrated
lit He vigor in this campaign.

Every afternoon, and some evenings, we had to 'study' turgid People's
Daily articles denouncing one thing or another, and hold nonsensical
'discussions' at which everyone repeated the newspaper's overblown,
vapid language.

We had to stay on the campus all the time, except Saturday evening and
Sunday, and had to return by Sunday evening.

I shared a bedroom with five other girls.  There were

Learning English in Mao's Wake 62 I two tiers of three bunk beds on
opposite walls.  In between was a table and six chairs where we did our
work.  There was scarcely room for our washbasins.  The window opened
onto a stinking open sewer.

English was my subject, but there was almost no way to learn it.  There
were no native English speakers around, indeed no foreigners at all.
The whole of Sichuan was closed to foreigners.  Occasionally the odd
one was let in, always a 'friend of China," but even to speak to them
without authorization was a criminal offense.  We could be put into
prison for listening to the BBC or the Voice of America.

No foreign publications were available except The Worker, the paper of
the minuscule Maoist Communist Party of Britain, and even this was
locked up in a special room.  I remember the thrill of being given
permission once, just once, to look at a copy.  My excitement wilted
when my eyes fell on the front-page article echoing the campaign to
criticize Confucius.  As I was sitting there nonplussed, a lecturer
whom I liked walked past and said with a smile, "That paper is probably
read only in China."

Our textbooks were ridiculous propaganda.  The first English sentence
we learned was "Long live Chairman Mao!"  But no one dared to explain
the sentence grammatically.  In Chinese the term for the optative mood,
expressing a wish or desire, means 'something unreal."  In 1966 a
lecturer at Sichuan University had been beaten up for 'having the
audacity to suggest that "Long live Chairman Mao!"  was unreal!"  One
chapter was about a model youth hero who had drowned after jumping into
a flood to save an electricity pole because the pole would be used to
carry the word of Mao.

With great difficulty, I managed to borrow some English language
textbooks published before the Cultural Revolution from lecturers in my
depa~unent and from Jin-ming, who sent me books from his university by
post.  These contained extracts from writers like Jane Austen, Charles
Dickens, and Oscar Wilde, and stories from European and

American history.  They were a joy to read, but much of my energy went
toward finding them and then trying to keep them.

Whenever someone approached, I would quickly cover the books with a
newspaper.  This was only partly because of their 'bourgeois' content.
It was also important not to appear to be studying too conscientiously,
and not to arouse my fellow students' jealousy by reading something far
beyond them.  Although we were studying English, and were paid par fly
for our propaganda value by the government to do this, we must not be
seen to be too devoted to our subject: that was considered being 'white
and expert."  In the mad logic of the day, being good at one's
profession ('expert') was automatically equated with being politically
unreliable ('white').

I had the misfortune to be better at English than my classmates, and
was therefore resented by some of the 'student officials," the
lowest-level controllers, who supervised political indoctrination
sessions and checked the 'thought conditions' of their fellow students.
The student officials in my course had mostly come from the
countryside.  They were keen to learn English, but most of them were
semi-literate, and had lit He aptitude.  I sympathized with their
anxiety and frustration, and understood their jealousy of me.  But
Mao's concept of 'white and expert' made them feel virtuous about their
inadequacies, and gave their envy political respectability, and them a
malicious opportunity to vent their exasperation.

Every now and then a student official would require a 'heart-to-heart'
with me.  The leader of the Party cell in my course was a former
peasant named Ming who had joined the army and then become a production
team leader.  He was a very poor student, and would give me long,
righteous lectures about the latest developments in the Cultural
Revolution, the 'glorious tasks of us worker peasant-soldier students,"
and the need for 'thought reform."  I needed these heart-to-hearts
because of my

Learning English in Mao's Pl~kc 02.;

'shortcomings," but Ming would never come straight to the point.  He
would let a criticism hang in midair "The masses have a complaint about
you.  Do you know what it is?"  and watch the effect on me.  He would
eventually disclose some allegation.  One day it was the inc~itablc
charge that I was 'white and expert."  Another day I was 'bourgeois'
because I failed to fight for the chance to clean the toilet, or to
wash my comrades' clothes all obligatory good deeds.  And yet another
time he would attribute a despicable motive: that I did not spend most
of my time tutoring my classmates because I did not want them to catch
up with me.

One criticism that Ming would put to me with trembling lips (he
obviously felt strongly about it) was "The masses have reported that
you are aloof.  You cut yourself off from the masses."  It was common
in China for people to assert that you were looking down on them if you
failed to hide your desire for some solitude.

One level up from the student officials were the political supervisors,
who also knew little or no English.  They did not like me.  Nor I them.
From time to time I had to report my thoughts to the one in charge of
my year, and before every session I would wander around the campus for
hours summoning up the courage to knock on his door.  Although he was
not, I believed, an evil person, I feared him.  But most of all I
dreaded the inevitable tedious, ambiguous diatribe.  Like many others,
he loved playing cat and mouse to indulge his feeling of power.  I had
to look humble and earnest, and promise things I did not mean and had
no intention of doing.

I began to feel nostalgia for my years in the countryside and the
factory, when I had been left relatively alone.  Universities were much
more tightly controlled, being of particular interest to Mme Mao.  Now
I was among people who had benefited from the Cultural Revolution.
Without it, many of them would never have been here.

Once some students in my year were given the project

624 "Snij~ng after Foreigners' Farts..."

of compiling a dictionary of English abbreviations.  The department had
decided that the existing one was 'reactionary' because, not
surprisingly, it had far more 'capitalist' abbreviations than ones with
an approved origin.

"Why should Roosevelt have an abbreviation FDR and not Chairman Mao?"
some students asked indignantly.  With tremendous solemnity they
searched for acceptable entries, but eventually had to give up their
'historic mission' as there simply were not enough of the right
kinds.

I found this environment unbearable.  I could understand ignorance, but
I could not accept its glorification, still less its right to rule.

We often had to leave the university to do things that were irrelevant
to our subjects.  Mao had said that we should 'learn things in
factories, the countryside, and army units."  What exactly we were
meant to learn was, typically, unspecified.  We started with 'learning
in the countryside."

One week into the first term of my first year, in October 1973, the
whole university was packed off to a place on the outskirts of Chengdu
called Mount Dragon Spring, which had been the victim of a visit by one
of China's vice-premiers, Chen Yonggui.  He was previously the leader
of a farming brigade called Dazhai in the mountainous northern province
of Shanxi, which had become Mao's model in agriculture, ostensibly
because it relied more on the peasants' revolutionary zeal than on
material incentives.

Mao did not notice, or did not care, that Dazhai's claims were largely
fraudulent.  When Vice-Premier Chen visited Mount Dragon Spring he had
remarked, "All, you have mountains here!  Imagine how many fields you
could create!"  as if the fertile hills covered in orchards were like
the barren mountains of his native village.  But his remarks had the
force of law.  The crowds of university students dynamited the orchards
that had provided Chengdu with apples, plums, peaches, and flowers.  We
transported stones from afar with pull carts and shoulder poles, for
the construction of terraced rice paddies.

It was compulsory to demonstrate zeal in this, as in all actions called
for by Mao.  Many of my fellow students worked in a manner that
screamed out for notice.  I was regarded as lacking in enthusiasm, par
fly because I had difficulty hiding my aversion to this activity, and
partly because I did not sweat easily, no matter how much energy I
expended.  Those students whose sweat poured out in streams were
invariably praised at the summing-up sessions every evening.

My university colleagues were certainly more eager than proficient. The
sticks of dynamite they shoved into the ground usually failed to go
off, which was just as well, as there were no safety precautions.  The
stone walls we built around the terraced edges soon collapsed, and by
the time we left, after two weeks, the mountain slope was a wasteland
of blast holes, cement solidified into shapeless masses, and piles of
stones.  Few seemed concerned about this.

The whole episode was ultimately a show, a piece of theater - a
pointless means to a pointless end.

I loathed these expeditions and hated the fact that our labor, and our
whole existence, was being used for a shoddy political game.  To my
intense irritation, I was sent off to an army unit, again with the
whole university, in late 1974.

The camp, a couple of hours' truck journey from Chengdu, was in a
beautiful spot, surrounded by rice paddies, peach blossoms, and bamboo
groves.  But our seventeen days there felt like a year.  I was
perpetually breathless from the long runs every morning, bruised from
falling and crawling under the imaginary gunfire of 'enemy' tanks, and
exhausted from hours of aiming a rifle at a target or throwing wooden
hand grenades.  I was expected to demonstrate my passion for, and my
excellence at, all these activities, at which I was hopeless.  It was
unforgivable for me to be good only at English, my subject.  These army
tasks were political assignments, and I had to prove myself in them.

Ironically, in the army itself, good marksmanship and other military
skills would lead to a soldier being condemned as 'white and expert."

I was one of the handful of students who threw the wooden hand grenades
such a dangerously short distance that we were banned from the grand
occasion of throwing the real thing.  As our pathetic group sat on the
top of a hill listening to the distant explosions, one girl burst into
sobs.  I felt deeply apprehensive too, at the thought of having given
apparent proof of being 'white."

Our second test was shooting.  As we marched onto the firing range, I
thought to myself: I cannot afford to fail this, I absolutely have to
pass.  When my name was called and I lay on the ground, gazing at the
target through the gunsight, I saw complete blackness.  No target, no
ground, nothing.  I was trembling so much my whole body felt powerless.
The order to fire sounded faint, as though it was floating from a great
distance through clouds.  I pulled the trigger, but I did not hear any
noise, or see anything.

When the results were checked, the instructors were p"7~led: none of my
ten bullets had even hit the board, let alone the target.

I could not believe it.  My eyesight was perfect.  I told the
instructor the gun barrel must be bent.  He seemed to believe me: the
result was too spectacularly bad to be entirely my fault.  I was given
another gun, provoking complaints from others who had asked,
unsuccessfully, for a second chance.  My second go was slightly better:
two of the ten bullets hit the outer rings.  Even so, my name was still
at the bottom of the whole university.  Seeing the results stuck on the
wall like a propaganda poster, I knew that my 'whiteness' was further
bleached.  I heard snide remarks from one student official: "Humph!
Getting a second chance!  As if that would do her any good!  If she has
no class feelings, or class hatred, a hundred goes won't save her!"

In my misery, I retreated into my own thoughts, and hardly noticed the
soldiers, young peasants in their early twenties, who instructed us.
Only one incident drew my attention to them.  One evening when some
girls collected their clothes from the line on which they had hung them
to dry, their knickers were unmistakably stained with semen.

In the university I found refuge in the homes of the professors and
lecturers who had obtained their jobs before the Cultural Revolution,
on academic merit.  Several of the professors had been to Britain or
the United States before the Communists took power, and I felt I could
relax and speak the same language with them.  Even so, they were
cautious.  Most intellectuals were, as the result of years of
repression.  We avoided dangerous topics.  Those who had been to the
West rarely talked about their time there.

Although I was dying to ask, I checked myself, not wanting to place
them in a difficult position.

Partly for the same reason, I never discussed my thoughts with my
parents.  How could they have responded with dangerous truths or safe
lies?  Besides, I did not want them to worry about my heretical ideas.
I wanted them to be genuinely in the dark, so that if anything happened
to me they could truthfully say they did not know.

The people to whom I did communicate my thoughts were friends of my own
generation.  Actually, there was little else to do except talk,
particularly with men friends.

To 'go out' with a man being seen alone together in public was
tantamount to an engagement.  There was still virtually no
entertainment to go to anyway.  Cinemas showed only the handful of
works approved by Mine Mao.

Occasionally a rare foreign movie, perhaps from Albania, would be
screened, but most of the tickets disappeared into the pockets of
people with connections.  A ferocious crowd would swamp the box office
and try to tear each other away from the window to get the remaining
few tickets.  Scalpers made a killing.

So, we just sat at home and talked.  We sat very properly,

as in Victorian England.  For women to have friendships with men was
unusual in those days, and a girlfriend once said to me, "I've never
known a girl who has so many men friends.  Girls normally have
girlfriends."  She was right.  I knew many girls who married the first
man who came near them.  From my own men friends, the only
demonstrations of interest I got were some rather sentimental poems and
restrained letters one of which, admittedly, was written in blood from
the goalkeeper on the college football team.

My friends and I often talked about the West.  By then I had come to
the conclusion that it was a wonderful place.

Paradoxically, the first people to put this idea into my head were Mao
and his regime.  For years, the things to which I was naturally
inclined had been condemned as evils of the West: pretty clothes,
flowers, books, entertainment, politeness, gentleness, spontaneity,
mercy, kindness, liberty, aversion to cruelty and violence, love
instead of 'class hatred," respect for human lives, the desire to be
left alone, professional competence .... As I sometimes wondered to
myself, how could anyone not desire the West.}

I was extremely curious about the alternatives to the kind of life I
had been leading, and my friends and I exchanged rumors and scraps of
information we dug from official publications.  I was struck less by
the West's technological developments and high living standards than by
the absence of political witch-hunts, the lack of consuming suspicion,
the dignity of the individual, and the incredible amount of liberty. To
me, the ultimate proof of freedom in the West was that there seemed to
be so many people there attacking the West and praising China. Almost
every other day the front page of Reference, the newspaper which carded
foreign press items, would feature some eulogy of Mao and the Cultural
Revolution.  At first I was angered by these, but they soon made me see
how tolerant another society could be.  I realized that this was the
kind of society I wanted to live in: where people were allowed to hold
different, even outrageous views.  I began to see that it was the very
tolerance of oppositions, of protesters, that kept the West
progressing.

Still, I could not help being irritated by some obser~'ations.  Once I
read an article by a Westerner who came to China to see some old
friends, university professors, who told him cheerfully how they had
enjoyed being denounced and sent to the back end of beyond, and how
much they had relished being reformed.  The author concluded that Mao
had indeed made the Chinese into 'new people' who would regard what was
misery to a Westerner as pleasure.

I was aghast.  Did he not know that repression was at its worst when
there was no complaint?  A hundred times more so when the victim
actually presented a smiling face?  Could he not see to what a pathetic
condition these professors had been reduced, and what horror must have
been involved to degrade them so?  I did not realize that the acting
that the Chinese were putting on was something to which Westerners were
unaccustomed, and which they could not always decode.

I did not appreciate either that information about China was not easily
available, or was largely misunderstood, in the West, and that people
with no experience of a regime like China's could take its propaganda
and rhetoric at face value.  As a result, I assumed that these eulogies
were dishonest.  My friends and I would joke that they had been bought
by our government's 'hospitality."  When foreigners were allowed into
certain restricted places in China following Nixon's visit, wherever
they went the authorities immediately cordoned off enclaves even within
these enclaves.  The best transport facilities, shops, restaurants,
guest houses and scenic spots were reserved for them, with signs
reading "For Foreign Guests Only."  Mao-tai, the most sought-after
liquor, was totally unavailable to ordinary Chinese, but freely
available to foreigners.  The best food was saved for foreigners.  The
newspapers proudly reported that Henry Kissinger had said his waistline
had expanded as a result of the many twelve-course banquets he
enjoyed

630 "Sniffing after Foreigners' Fans

during his visits to China.  This was at a time when in Sichuan,
"Heaven's Granary," our meat ration was half a pound per month, and the
streets of Chengdu were full of homeless peasants who had fled there
from famine in the north, and were living as beggars.  There was great
resentment among the population about how the foreigners were treated
like lords.  My friends and I began saying among ourselves: "Why do we
attack the Kuomintang for allowing signs saying "No Chinese or Dogs"
aren't we doing the same~'

Getting hold of information became an obsession.  I benefited
enormously from my ability to read English, as although the university
library had been looted during the Cultural Revolution, most of the
books it had lost had been in Chinese.  Its extensive English-language
collection had been turned upside down, but was still largely intact.

The librarians were delighted that these books were being read,
especially by a student, and were extremely helpful.  The index system
had been thrown into chaos, and they dug through piles of books to find
the ones I wanted.  It was through the efforts of these kind young men
and women that I laid my hands on some English classics.

Louisa May Alcott's Little Women was the first novel I read in English.
I found women writers like her, Jane Austen, and the Bronti~ sisters
much easier to read than male authors like Dickens, and I also felt
more empathy with their characters.  I read a brief history of European
and American literature, and was enormously impressed by the Greek
tradition of democracy, Renaissance humanism, and the Enlightenment's
questioning of everything.  When I read in Gulliver's Travels about the
emperor who 'published an Edict, commanding all his Subjects, upon
great Penalties, to break the smaller End of their Eggs," I wondered if
Swift had been to China.  My joy at the sensation of my mind opening up
and expanding was beyond description.

Being alone in the library was heaven for me.  My heart would leap as I
approached it, usually at dusk, anticipating

Learning English in Mao's P~ake 63 i the pleasure of solitude with my
books, the outside world ceasing to exist.  As I hurried up the flight
of stairs, into the pastiche classical-style building, the smell of old
books long stored in airless rooms would give me tremors of excitement,
and I would hate the stairs for being too long.

With the help of dictionaries which some professors lent me, I became
acquainted with Longfellow, Wait Whitman, and American history.  I
memorized the whole of the Declaration of Independence, and my heart
swelled at the words "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all
men are created equal," and those about men's 'unalienable Rights,"
among them "Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."  These concepts were
unheard of in China, and opened up a marvelous new world for me.  My
notebooks, which I kept with me at all times, were full of passages
like these, passionately and tearfully copied out.

One autumn day in 1974, with an air of extreme secrecy, a friend of
mine showed me a copy of Newsweek with pictures of Mao and Mme Mao in
it.  She could not read English, and was keen to know what the article
said.  This was the first genuine foreign magazine I had ever set eyes
on.  One sentence in the article struck me like a flash of lightning.
It said that Mme Mao was Mao's 'eyes, ears, and voice."  Up fill that
moment, I had never allowed myself to contemplate the obvious
connection between Mme Mao's deeds and her husband.  But now Mao's name
was spelled out for me.  My blurred perceptions surrounding his image
came sharply into focus.  It was Mao who had been behind the
destruction and suffering.  Without him, Mme Mao and her second-rate
coterie could not have lasted a single day.  I experienced the thrill
of challenging Mao openly in my mind for the first time.

27.  "If Thb Is Paradise, What Then Is Hell?  "The Death of My Father

(1974-1970)

All this time, unlike most of his former colleagues, my father had not
been rehabilitated or given a job.  He had been sitting at home in
Meteorite Street doing nothing since he came back from Peking with my
mother and me in autumn 197z.  The problem was that he had criticized
Mao by name.  The team investigating him was sympathetic and tried to
ascribe some of what he had said against Mao to his mental illness. But
the team came up against fierce opposition amongst the higher
authorities, who wanted to give him a severe condemnation.  Many of my
father's colleagues sympathized with him and indeed admired him.

But they had to think about their own necks.  Besides, my father did
not belong to any clique and had no powerful patron which might have
helped get him cleared.  Instead, he had well-placed enemies.

One day back in 1968, my mother, who was briefly out from detention,
saw an old friend of my father's at a roadside food stall.  This man
had thrown in his lot with the Tings.  He was with his wife, who had
actually been introduced to him by my mother and Mrs.  Ting when they
were working together in Yibin.  In spite of the couple's obvious
reluctance to have anything to do with her beyond a brief nod, my
mother marched up to their table and joined them.

She asked them to appeal to the Tings to spare my father.

After hearing my mother out, the man shook his head and said, "It's not
so simple .... Then he dipped a finger into his tea and wrote the
character Zuo on the table.  He gave my mother a meaningful look, got
up with his wife, and left without another word.

Zuo was a former close colleague of my father's, and was one of the few
senior officials who did not suffer at all in the Cultural Revolution.
He became the darling of Mrs.  Shau's Rebels and a friend of the Tings,
but survived their demise and that of L'm Biao and remained in power.

My father would not withdraw his words against Mao.

But when the team investigating him suggested putting them down to his
mental illness, he acquiesced, with great anguish.

Meanwhile, the general situation made him despondent.

There were no principles governing either the behavior of the people or
the conduct of the Party.  Corruption began to come back in a big way.
Officials looked after their families and friends first.  For fear of
being beaten up, teachers gave all pupils top marks irrespective of the
quality of their work, and bus conductors would not collect fares.

Dedication to public good was openly sneered at.  Mao's Cultural
Revolution had destroyed both Party discipline and civic morality.

My father found it difficult to control himself so that he would not
speak his mind and say things that would incriminate him and his family
further.

He had to rely on tranquilizers.  When the political climate was more
relaxed, he took less; when the campaigns intensified, he took more.
Every time the psychiatrists renewed his supply, they shook their
heads, saying it was extremely dangerous for him to continue taking
such large

634 "If This Is Paradise, What Then Is Hell?"

doses.  But he could only manage short periods off the pills.

In May 1974 he sensed that he was on the verge of a breakdown, and
asked to be given psychiatric treatment.

This time he was hospitalized swiftly, thanks to his former colleagues
who were now back in charge of the health service.

I got leave from the university and went to stay with him in the
hospital to keep him company.  Dr.  Su, the psychiatrist who had
treated him before, was looking after him again.  Under the Tings, Dr.
Su had been condemned for giving a true diagnosis about my father, and
had been ordered to write a confession saying my father had been faking
madness.  He refused, for which he was subjected to denunciation
meetings, beaten up, and thrown out of the medical profession.  I saw
him one day in 1968, emptying rubbish bins and cleaning the hospital
spittoons.  His hair had turned gray, though he was only in his
thirties.  After the downfall of the Tings he was rehabilitated.  He
was very friendly to my father and me, as were all the doctors and
nurses.  They told me they would take good care of my father, and that
I did not have to stay with him.  But I wanted to.  I thought he needed
love more than anything else.  And I was anxious about what might
happen if he fell down with no one around.  His blood pressure was
dangerously high, and he had already had several minor heart attacks,
which had left him with a walking impediment.  He looked as though he
might slip at any time.

Doctors warned that a fall could be fatal.  I moved into the men's ward
with him, into the same room he had occupied in summer 1967.  Each room
could accommodate two patients, but my father had the room to himself,
and I slept in the spare bed.

I was with him every moment in case he fell over.  When he went to the
toilet, I waited outside.  If he stayed in there for what I thought was
too long, I would start to imagine he had had a heart attack, and would
make a fool of myself by calling out to him.  Every day I took long
walks with him in the back garden, which was full of other psychiatric
patients in gray-striped pajamas walking incessantly, with spiritless
eyes.  The sight of them always made me scared and intensely sad.

The garden itself was full of vivid colors.  White butterflies
fluttered among yellow dandelions on the lawn.  In the surrounding
flowerbeds were a Chinese aspen, graceful swaying bamboos, and a few
garnet flowers of pomegranates behind a thicket of oleanders.  As we
walked, I composed my poems.

At one end of the garden was a large entertainment room where the
inmates went to play cards and chess and to flip through the few
newspapers and sanctioned books.

One nurse told me that earlier in the Cultural Revolution the room had
been used for the inmates to study Chairman Mao's works because his
nephew, Mao Yuanxin, had 'discovered' that Mao's Litfie Red Book,
rather than medical treatment, was the cure for mental patients.  The
study sessions did not last long, the nurse told me, because 'whenever
a patient opened his mouth, we were all scared to death.  Who knew what
he was going to say?"

The patients were not violent, as their treatment had sapped their
physical and mental vitality.  Even so, living among them was
frightening, particularly at night, when my father's pills had sent him
into a sound sleep and the whole building had become quiet.  Like all
the rooms, ours had no lock, and several times I woke with a start to
find a man standing by my bed, holding the mosquito net open and
staring at me with the intensity of the insane.  I would break into a
cold sweat and pull up the quilt to stifle a scream: the last thing I
wanted was to wake my father sleep was vital to his recovery.
Eventually, the patient would shuffle away.

After a month, my father went home.  But he was not completely cured
his mind had been under too much pressure for too long, and the
political environment was still too repressive for him to relax.  He
had to keep taking tranquilizers.  There was nothing the psychiatrists
could do.  His nervous system was wearing out, and so were his body and
mind.

Eventually, a draft verdict on him was drawn up by the team
investigating him.  It said that he had 'committed serious political
errors' which was one step away from behind labeled a 'class enemy." In
line with Party regulations, the draft verdict was given to my father
to sign as confirmation that he accepted it.  When he read it, he
wept.

But he signed.

The verdict was not accepted by the higher authorities.

They wanted a harsher one.

In March 1975, my brother-in-law Specs was up for promotion in his
factory, and the personnel officers of the factory came to my father's
depa~UHent for the obligatory political investigation.  A former Rebel
from Mrs.  Shau's group received the visitors and told them my father
was 'anti-Mao."  Specs did not get his promotion.  He did not mention
it to my parents for fear of upsetting them, but a friend from my
father's department came to the house and my father overheard him
whispering the news to my mother.  The pain he showed was harrowing
when he apologized to Specs for jeopardizing his future.  In tears of
despair he said to my mother, "What have I done for even my son-in-law
to be dragged down like this?  What do I have to do to save you?"

In spite of taking a large number of tranquilizers, my father hardly
slept over the following days and nights.  On the afternoon of 9 April
he said he was going to have a nap.

When my mother finished cooking supper in our small ground-floor
kitchen, she thought she would leave him to sleep a little longer.
Eventually she went upstairs to the bedroom and found she could not
wake him.  She realized he had had a heart attack.  We had no
telephone, so she rushed to the provincial government clinic one street
away and found its head, Dr.  Jen.

The Death o My Father 637 DrJen was extremely able, and before the
Cultural Revolution he had been in charge of the health of the elite in
the compound.  He had often come to our apartment, and would discuss
the health of all my family, with great concern.  But when the Cultural
Revolution started and we were out of favor, he became cold and
disdainful toward us.  I saw many people like DrJen, and their behavior
never ceased to shock me.

When my mother found him, Dr.  Jen was clearly irritated, and said he
would come when he had finished what he was doing.  She told him a
heart attack could not wait, but he looked at her as if to say that
impatience would not help her.  It was an hour before he deigned to
come to our house with a nurse, but without any first-aid equipment.

The nurse had to walk back to fetch it.  Dr.  Jen turned Father over a
few times, and then just sat and waited.

Another half an hour passed, by which time my father was dead.

That night I was in my dormitory at the university, working by
candlelight during one of the frequent blackouts.

Some people from my father's department arrived and drove me home
without explanation.

Father lay sideways in his bed, his face unusually peaceful, as though
he had gone to a restful sleep.  He no longer looked senescent, but
youthful, even younger than his age of fifty-four.  I felt as if my
heart was torn into fragments, and I wept uncontrollably.

For days I wept in silence.  I thought of my father's life, his wasted
dedication and crushed dreams.  He need not have died.  Yet his death
seemed so inevitable.  There was no place for him in Mao's China,
because he had tried to be an honest man.  He had been betrayed by
something to which he had given his whole life, and the betrayal had
destroyed him.

My mother demanded that DrJen be punished.  If it had not been for his
negligence, my father might not have died.

Her request was dismissed as a 'widow's emotionalism."

She decided not to pursue the matter.  She wanted to concentrate on a
more important battle: getting an acceptable memorial speech for my
father.

This speech was extremely important, because it would be understood by
everyone to be the Party's assessment of my father.  It would be put
into his personal file and continue to determine his children's future,
even though he was dead.  There were set patterns and fixed
formulations for such a speech.  Any deviation from the standard
expressions used for an official who had been cleared would be
interpreted as the Party having reservations about, or condemning, the
dead person.  A draft speech was drawn up and shown to my mother.  It
was full of damning deviations.  My mother knew that with this
valedictory my family would never be free of suspicion.  At best we
would live in a state of permanent insecurity; more likely, we would be
discriminated against for generation after generation.  She turned down
several drafts.

The odds were heavily against her, but she knew that there was a lot of
sympathy for my father.  This was the traditional time for a Chinese
family to engage in a bit of emotional blackmail.  After my father's
death she had had a collapse, but she ban led with undiminished
determination from her sickbed.  She threatened to denounce the
authorities at the memorial service if she did not get an acceptable
valedictory.  She summoned my father's friends and colleagues to her
bedside, and told them she was putting the future of her children in
their hands.  They promised to speak up for my father.  In the end, the
authorities relented.

Although no one yet dared to treat him as rehabilitated, the assessment
was modified to one that was fairly innocuous.

The service was held on 21 April.  Following the standard practice, it
was organized by a 'funeral committee' of my father's former
colleagues, including people who had helped to persecute him, like Zuo.
It was carefully staged down to the last detail, and was attended by
about 500 people, according to the prescribed formula.  These were
apportioned between the several dozen departments and bureaus of the
provincial government and the offices that came under my father's
department.  Even the odious Mrs.  Shau was there.  Each organization
was asked to send a wreath, made of paper flowers, the size of which
was specified.  In a way, my family welcomed the fact that the occasion
was official.  A private ceremony was unheard of for someone of my
father's position, and would be taken as a repudiation by the Party.  I
did not recognize most of the people there, but all my close friends
who knew about my father's death came, including Plumpie, Nana, and the
electricians from my old factory.  My classmates from Sichuan
University came as well, including the student official Ming.  My old
friend Bing, whom I had refused to see after my grandmother's death,
turned up and our friendship immediately picked up where it had left
off six years before.

The ritual prescribed that one 'representative of the family of the
deceased' should speak, and this role fell to me.  I recalled my
father's character, his moral principles, his faith in his Party, and
his passionate dedication to the people.  I hoped that the tragedy of
his death would leave the participants with plenty to mull over.

At the end, when everyone filed past and shook hands with us, I saw
tears on the faces of many former Rebels.

Even Mrs.  Shall looked lugubrious.  They had a mask for every
occasion.  Some of the Rebels murmured to me, "We are all very sorry
about what your father went through."

Maybe they were.  But what difference did that make?  My father was
dead and they had had a big hand in killing him.  Would they do the
same thing to somebody else in the next campaign, I wondered.

A young woman I did not know laid her head on my shoulder and sobbed
violently.  I felt a note being tucked into my hand.  I read it
afterward.  On it was scribbled: "I was deeply moved by the character
of your father.  We must learn from him and be worthy successors to the
cause he has left behind the great proletarian revolutionary cause."

Did my speech really give rise to this, I pondered.  It seemed there
was no escape from the Communists' appropriation of moral principles
and noble sentiments.

Some weeks before my father's death, I had been sitting in the Chengdu
railway station with him waiting for a friend of his to arrive.  We
were in the same half-open waiting area where my mother and I had sat
nearly a decade before when she was going to Peking to appeal for him.
The waiting area had not changed much, except that it looked shabbier,
and was much more crowded.  Still more people thronged the large square
out in front.  Some were sleeping there, some just sitting, others
breast-feeding their babies;

quite a few were begging.  These were peasants from the north, where
there was a local famine the result of bad weather and, in some cases,
sabotage by Mme Mao's coterie.  They had come down on trains, crammed
onto the roofs of the carriages.  There were many stories about people
being swept off, or decapitated going through tunnels.

On our way to the station, I had asked my father if I could go down the
Yangtze during the summer vacation.

"The priority in my life," I had declared, 'is to have fun."

He had shaken his head disapprovingly.

"When you are young, you should make your priority study and work."

I brought up the subject again in the waiting area.  A cleaner was
sweeping the ground.  At one point her path was par fly blocked by a
northern peasant woman who was sitting on the cement floor with a
tattered bundle next to her and two toddlers in rags.  A third child
was suckling her breast, which she had bared without a trace of
shyness, and which was black with dirt.  The cleaner swept the dust
right over them, as though they were not there.  The peasant woman did
not move a muscle.

My father turned to me and said, "With people living like this all
around you, how can you possibly have fun?"  I was silent.  I did not
say, "But what can I, a mere individual, do?  Must I live miserably for
nothing?"  That would have sounded shockingly selfish.  I had been
brought up in the tradition of 'regarding the interest of the whole
nation as my own duty' (yi tian-xia wei fi-ren).

Now, in the emptiness I felt after my father's death, I began to
question all such precepts.  I wanted no grand mission, no 'causes,"
just a life a quiet, perhaps a frivolous life of my own.  I told my
mother that when the summer vacation came I wanted to travel down the
Yangtze.

She urged me to go.  So did my sister, who, along with Specs, had been
living with my family since she had returned to Chengdu.  Specs's
factory, which should normally have been responsible for providing him
with housing, had built no new apartments during the Cultural
Revolution.  Then many employees, like Specs, had been single, and
lived in dormitories eight to a room.  Now, ten years later, most of
them were married and had children.

There was nowhere for them to live, so they had to stay with their
parents or parents-in-law, and it was commonplace for three generations
to live in one room.

My sister had not been given a job, as the fact that she had got
married before she had a job in the city excluded her from employment.
Now, thanks to a regulation which said that when a state employee died
one of their offspring could take their place, my sister was given a
post in the administration of the Chengdu College of Chinese
Medicine.

In July I set off on my journey with Jin-ming, who was studying in
Wuhan, a big city on the Yangtze.  Our first stop was the nearby
mountain of Lushan, which had luxuriant vegetation and an excellent
climate.  Important Party conferences had been held there, including
the one in 1959 at which Marshal Peng Dehuai was denounced, and the
site was designated as a place of interest 'for people to receive a
revolutionary education."  When I suggested going there to have a look,
Jin-ming said incredulously, "You don't want a break from
"revolutionary education"?"

We took a lot of photographs on the mountain, and had finished a whole
roll of thirty-six exposures except for one.

On our way down, we passed a two-story villa, hidden in a thicket of
Chinese parasol trees, magnolia, and pines.  It looked almost like a
random pile of stones against the background of the rocks.  It struck
me as an unusually lovely place, and I snapped my last shot.  Suddenly
a man materialized out of nowhere and asked me in a low but commanding
voice to hand over my camera.  He wore civilian clothes, but I noticed
he had a pistol.  He opened the camera and exposed my entire roll of
film.  Then he disappeared, as if into the earth.  Some tourists
standing next to me whispered that this was one of Mao's summer villas.
I felt another pang of revulsion toward Mao, not so much for his
privilege, but for the hypocrisy of allowing himself luxury while
telling his people that even comfort was bad for them.  After we were
safely out of earshot of the invisible guard, and I was bemoaning the
loss of my thirty-six pictures, Jin-ming gave me a grin: "See where
goggling at holy places gets you!"

We left Lushan by bus.  Like every bus in China, it was packed, and we
had to crane our necks desperately trying to breathe.  Virtually no new
buses had been built since the beginning of the Cultural Revolution,
during which time the urban population had increased by several tens of
millions.  After a few minutes, we suddenly stopped.  The front door
was forced open, and an authoritative-looking man in plainclothes
squeezed in.

"Get down!  Get down!"  he barked.

"Some American guests are coming this way.  It is harmful to the
prestige of our motherland for them to see all these messy heads!"  We
tried to crouch down, but the bus was too crowded.  The man shouted,
"It is the duty of everyone to safeguard the honor of our motherland!
We must present an orderly and dignified appearance!  Get down!  Bend
your knees!"

Suddenly I heard Jin-ming's booming voice: "Doesn'T Chairman Mao
instruct us never to bend our knees to American imperialists?"  This
was asking for trouble.

Humor was not appreciated.  The man shot a stern glance in our
direction, but said nothing.  He gave the bus another quick scan, and
hurried off.  He did not want the "American guests' to witness a scene.
Any sign of discord had to be hidden from foreigners.

Wherever we went as we traveled down the Yangtze we saw the aftermath
of the Cultural Revolution: temples smashed, statues toppled, and old
towns wrecked.  Litfie evidence remained of China's ancient
civilization.  But the loss went even deeper than this.  Not only had
China destroyed most of its beautiful things, it had lost its
appreciation of them, and was unable to make new ones.  Except for the
much-scarred but still stunning landscape, China had become an ugly
country.

At the end of the vacation, I took a steamer alone from Wuhan back up
through the Yangtze Gorges.  The journey took three days.  One morning,
as I was leaning over the side, a gust of wind blew my hair loose and
my hairpin fell into the river.  A passenger with whom I had been
chatting pointed to a tributary which joined the Yangtze just where we
were passing, and told me a story.

In 33 ~c, the emperor of China, in an attempt to appease the country's
powerful northern neighbors, the Huns, decided to send a woman to marry
the barbarian king.  He made his selection from the portraits of the
3,000 concubines in his court, many of whom he had never seen.  As she
was for a barbarian, he selected the ugliest portrait, but on the day
of her departure he discovered that the woman was in fact extremely
beautiful.  Her portrait was ugly because she had refused to bribe the
court painter.

The emperor ordered the artist to be executed, while the lady wept,
sitting by a river, at having to leave her country to live among the
barbarians.  The wind carried away her hairpin and dropped it into the
river as though it wanted to keep something of hers in her homeland.
Later on, she killed herself.

Legend had it that where her hairpin dropped, the river turned crystal
clear, and became known as the Crystal

River.  My fellow passenger told me this was the tributary we were
passing.  With a grin, he declared: "Ah, bad omen!

You might end up living in a foreign land and marrying a barbarian!"  I
smiled faintly at the traditional Chinese obsession about other races
being 'barbarians," and wondered whether this lady of antiquity might
not actually have been better off marrying the 'barbarian' king.  She
would at least be in daily contact with the grassland, the horses, and
nature.  With the Chinese emperor, she was living in a luxurious
prison, without even a proper tree, which might enable the concubines
to climb a wall and escape.  I thought how we were like the frogs at
the bottom of the well in the

Chinese legend, who claimed that the sky was only as big as the round
opening at the top of their well.  I felt an intense and urgent desire
to see the world.

At the time I had never spoken with a foreigner, even though I was
twenty-three, and had been an Englishlanguage student for nearly two
years.  The only foreignersI had ever even set eyes on had been in
Peking in 1972.

A foreigner, one of the few 'friends of China," had come to my
university once.  It was a hot summer day and I was having a nap when a
fellow student burst into our room and woke us all by shrieking: "A
foreigner is here!  Let's go and look at the foreigner!"  Some of the
others went, but I decided to stay and continue my snooze.  I found the
whole idea of gazing, zombie like rather ridiculous.  Anyway, what was
the point of staring if we were forbidden to open our mouths to him,
even though he was a 'friend of China'?

I had never even heard a foreigner speaking, except on one single
Linguaphone record.  When I started learning the language, I had
borrowed the record and a phonograph, and listened to it at home in
Meteorite Street.  Some neighbors gathered in the courtyard, and said
with their eyes wide open and their heads shaking, "What funny
sounds!"

They asked me to play the record over and over again.

Speaking to a foreigner was the dream of every student, and my
opportunity came at last.  When I got back from my trip down the
Yangtze, I learned that my year was being sent in October to a port in
the south called Zhanjiang to practice our English with foreign
sailors.  I was thrilled.

Zhanjiang was about 75 miles from Chengdu, a journey of two days and
two nights by rail.  It was the southernmost large port in China, and
quite near the Vietnamese border.

It felt like a foreign country, with turn-of-the-century colonial-style
buildings, pastiche Romanesque arches, rose windows, and large verandas
with colorful parasols.  The local people spoke Cantonese, which was
almost a foreign language.  The air smelled of the unfamiliar sea,
exotic tropical vegetation, and an altogether bigger world.

But my excitement at being there was constantly doused by frustration.
We were accompanied by a political supervisor and three lecturers, who
decided that, although we were staying only a mile from the sea, we
were not to be allowed anywhere near it.  The harbor itself was closed
to outsiders, for fear of 'sabotage' or defection.  We were told that a
student from Guangzhou had managed to stow away once in a cargo
steamer, not realizing that the hold would be sealed for weeks, by
which time he had perished.  We had to restrict our movements to a
clearly defined area of a few blocks around our residence.

Regulations like these were part of our daily life, but they never
failed to infuriate me.  One day I was seized by an absolute compulsion
to get out.  I faked illness and got permission to go to a hospital in
the middle of the city.  I wandered the streets desperately trying to
spot the sea, without success.  The local people were unhelpful: they
did not like non-Cantonese speakers, and refused to understand me.  We
stayed in the port for three weeks, and only once were we allowed, as a
special treat, to go to an island to see the ocean.

As the point of being there was to talk to the sailors, we were
organized into small groups to take turns working in the two places
they were allowed to frequent: the Friendship Store, which sold goods
for hard currency, and the Sailors' Club, which had a bar, a
restaurant, a billiards room, and a ping-pong room.

There were strict rules about how we could talk to the sailors.  We
were not allowed to speak to them alone, except for brief exchanges
over the counter of the Friendship Store.  If we were asked our names
and addresses, under no circumstances were we to give our real ones. We
all prepared a false name and a nonexistent address.  After every
conversation, we had to write a detailed report of what had been said
which was standard practice for anyone who had contact with foreigners.
We were warned over and over again about the importance of observing
'discipline in foreign contacts' (she waifi-lu).  Otherwise, we were
told, not only would we get into serious trouble, other students would
be banned from coming.

Actually, our opportunities for practising English were few and far
between.  The ships did not come every day, and not all sailors came on
shore.  Most of the sailors were not native English speakers: there
were Greeks, Japanese, Yugoslavs, Africans, and many Filipinos, most of
whom spoke only a little English, although there was also a Scottish
captain and his wife, as well as some Scandinavians whose English was
excellent.

While we waited in the club for our precious sailors, I often sat on
the veranda at the back, reading and gazing at the groves of coconut
and palm trees, silhouetted against a sapphire-blue sky.  The moment
the sailors sauntered in, we would leap up and virtually grab them,
while trying to appear as dignified as possible, so eager were we to
engage them in conversation.  I often saw a pn7~led look in their eyes
when we declined their offers of a drink.  We were forbidden to accept
drinks from them.  In fact, we were not allowed to drink at all: the
fancy foreign bottles and cans

The Death of,~y leather 647 on display were exclusively for the
foreigners.  We just sat there, four or five infimidatingly
serious-looking young men and women.  I had no idea how odd it must
have seemed to the sailors and how far from their expectations of port
life.

When the first black sailors arrived, our teachers gently warned the
women students to watch out: "They are less developed and haven't
learned to control their instincts, so they are given to displaying
their feelings whenever they like: touching, embracing, even kissing."
To a roomful of shocked and disgusted faces, our teachers told us that
one woman in the last group had burst out screaming in the middle of a
conversation when a Gambian sailor had tried to hug her.  She thought
she was going to be raped (in the middle of a crowd, a Chinese crowd!),
and was so scared that she could not bring herself to talk to another
foreigner for the rest of her stay.

The male students, particularly the student officials, assumed
responsibility for safeguarding us women.  Whenever a black sailor
started talking to one of us, they would eye each other and hurry to
our rescue by taking over the conversation and positioning themselves
between us and the sailors.  Their precautions may not have been
noticed by the black sailors, especially as the students would
immediately start talking about 'the friendship between China and the
peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America."

"China is a developing country," they would intone, reciting from our
textbook, 'and will stand forever by the side of the oppressed and
exploited masses in the third world in their struggle against the
American imperialists and the Soviet revisionists."  The blacks would
look baffled but touched.  Sometimes they embraced the Chinese men, who
returned comradely hugs.

Much was being made by the regime about China being one of the
developing countries, part of the third world, according to Mao's
'glorious theory."  But Mao made it sound as if this was not the
acknowledgment of a fact, but that China was magnanimously lowering
itself to their level.  The way he said it left no doubt that we had
joined the ranks of the third world in order to lead it and protect it,
and the world regarded our rightful place to be somewhat grander.

I was extremely irritated by this self-styled superiority.

What had we got to be superior about?  Our population?

Our size?  In Zhanjiang, I saw that the third world sailors, with their
flashy watches, cameras, and drinks none of which we had ever seen
before were immeasurably better off, and incomparably freer, than all
but a very few Chinese.

I was terribly curious about foreigners, and was eager to discover what
they were really like.  How similar to the Chinese were they, and how
different?  But I had to try to conceal my inquisitiveness which, apart
from being politically dangerous, would be regarded as losing face.
Under Mao, as in the days of the Middle Kingdom, the Chinese placed
great importance on holding themselves with 'dignity' in front of
foreigners, by which was meant appearing aloof, or inscrutable.  A
common form this took was to show no interest in the outside world, and
many of my fellow students never asked any questions.

Perhaps partly due to my uncontrollable curiosity, and partly due to my
better English, the sailors all seemed keen to talk to me in spite of
the fact that I took care to speak as little as possible so that my
fellow students had more chance to practice.  Some sailors would even
refuse to talk to the other students.  I was also very popular with the
director of the Sailors' Club, an enormous, burly man called Long. This
aroused the ire of Ming and some of the minders.  Our political
meetings now included an examination of how we were observing 'the
disciplines in foreign contact."  It was stated that I had violated
these because my eyes looked 'too interested," I 'smiled too often,"
and when I did so I opened my mouth 'too wide."  I was also criticized
for using hand gestures:

we women students were supposed to keep our hands under the table and
sit motionless.

Much of Chinese societ)' still expected its women to hold themselves in
a sedate manner, lower their eyelids in response to men's stares, and
restrict their smile to a faint curve of the lips which did not expose
their teeth.  They were not meant to use hand gestures at all.  If they
contravened any of these canons of behavior they would be considered
'flirtatious."  Under Mao, flirting with./bre/gners was an unspeakable
crime.

I was furious at the innuendo against me.  It had been my Communist
parents who had given me a liberal upbringing.

They had regarded the restrictions on women as precisely the sort of
thing a Communist revolution should put an end to.  But now oppression
of women joined hands with political repression, and served resentment
and petty jealousy.

One day, a Pakistani ship arrived.  The Pakistani military attache came
down from Peking.  Long ordered us all to spring-clean the club from
top to bottom, and laid on a banquet, for which he asked me to be his
interpreter, which made some of the other students extremely envious. A
few days later the Pakistanis gave a farewell dinner on their ship, and
I was invited.  The military attache had been to Sichuan, and they had
prepared a special Sichuan dish for me.  Long was delighted by the
invitation, as was I. But despite a personal appeal from the captain
and even a threat from Long to bar future students, my teachers said
that no one was allowed on board a foreign ship.

"Who would take the responsibility if someone sailed away on the ship?"
they asked.  I was told to say I was busy that evening.

As far as I knew, I was turning down the only chance I would ever have
of a trip out to sea, a foreign meal, a proper conversation in English,
and an experience of the outside world.

Even so, I could not silence the whispers.  Ming asked pointedly, "Why
do foreigners like her so much?"  as though

65o "If This Is Paradise, What Then Is Hell?"

there was something suspicious in that.  The report filed on me at the
end of the trip said my behavior was 'politically dubious."

In this lovely port, with its sunshine, sea breezes, and coconut trees,
every occasion that should have been joyous was turned into misery.  I
had a good friend in the group who tried to cheer me up by putting my
distress into perspective.  Of course, what I encountered was no more
than minor unpleasantness compared with what victims of jealousy
suffered in the earlier years of the Cultural Revolution.  But the
thought that this was what my life at its best would be like depressed
me even more.

This friend was the son of a colleague of my father's.

The other students from cities were also friendly to me.  It was easy
to distinguish them from the students of peasant backgrounds, who
provided most of the student officials.

The city students were much more secure and confident when confronted
with the novel world of the port and they therefore did not feel the
same anxiety and the urge to be aggressive toward me.  Zhanjiang was a
severe culture shock to the former peasants, and their feelings of
inferiority were at the core of their compulsion to make life a misery
for others.

After three weeks, I was both sorry and relieved to say goodbye to
Zhanjiang.  On the way back to Chengdu, some friends and I went to the
legendary Guilin, where the mountains and waters looked as though they
had sprung from a classical Chinese painting.  There were foreign
tourists there, and we saw one couple with a baby in the man's arms. We
smiled at each other, and said "Good morning' and "Goodbye."  As soon
as they disappeared, a plainclothes policeman stopped us and questioned
us.

I returned to Chengdu in December, to find the city seething with
emotion against Mme Mao and three men from Shanghai, Zhang Chunqiao,
Yao Wenyuan, and Wang Hongwen, who had banded together to hold the fort
of the Cultural Revolution.  They had become so close that

The Death of My Father 65 I Mao had warned them against forming a "Gang
of Four' in July 1974, although we did not know this at the time.

By now the eighty-one-year-old Mao had begun to give them his full
backing, having had enough of the pragmatic approach of Zhou Enlai and
then of Deng Xiaoping, who had been running the day-to-day work of the
government since January 1975, when Zhou had gone into a hospital with
cancer.  The Gang's endless and pointless mini-campaigns had driven the
population to the end of their tether, and people had started
circulating rumors privately, as almost the only outlet for their
intense frustration.

Highly charged speculation was particularly directed against Mine Mao.
Since she was frequently seen together with one particular opera actor,
one ping-pong player, and one ballet dancer, each of whom had been
promoted by her to head their fields, and since they all happened to be
handsome young men, people said she had taken them as 'male
concubines," something she had openly and airily said women should do.
But everyone knew this did not apply to the general public.  In fact,
it was under Mme Mao in the Cultural Revolution that the Chinese
suffered extreme sexual repression.  With her controlling the media and
the arts for nearly ten years, any reference to love was deleted from
the hearing and sight of the population.  When a Vietnamese army
song-and-dance troupe came to China, those few who were lucky enough to
see it were told by the announcer that a song which mentioned love 'is
about the comradely affection between two comrades."  In the few
European films which were allowed mainly from Albania and Romania all
scenes of men and women standing close to each other, let alone
kissing, were cut out.

Frequently in crowded buses, trains, and shops I would hear women
yelling abuse at men and slapping their faces.

Sometimes the man would shout a denial and an exchange of insults would
ensue.  I experienced many attempted molestations.  When it happened, I
would just sneak away from the trembling hands or knees.  I felt sorry
for these men.

They lived in a world where there could be no outlet for their
sexuality unless they were lucky enough to have a happy marriage, the
chances of which were slim.  The deputy Party secretary of my
university, an elderly man, was caught in a department store with sperm
oozing through his trousers.  The crowds had pressed him against a
woman in front of him.  He was taken to the police station, and
subsequently expelled from the Party.  Women had just as tough a time.
In every organization, one or two of them would be condemned as
'worn-out shoes' for having had extramarital affairs.

These standards were not applied to the rulers.  The octogenarian Mao
surrounded himself with pretty young women.  Although the stories about
him were whispered and cautious, those about his wife and her cronies,
the Gang of Four, were open and uninhibited.  By the end of 1975, China
was boiling with incensed rumors.  In the mini-campaign called "Our
Socialist Motherland Is Paradise," many openly hinted at the question
which I had asked myself for the first time eight years before: "If
this is paradise, what then is hell?"

On 8 January 1976, Premier Zhou Enlai died.  To me and many other
Chinese, Zhou had represented a comparatively sane and liberal
government that believed in making the country work.  In the dark years
of the Cultural Revolution, Zhou was our meager hope.  I was
griefstricken at his death, as were all my friends.  Our mourning for
him and our loathing of the Cultural Revolution and of Mao and his
coterie became inseparably interwoven.

But Zhou had collaborated with Mao in the Cultural Revolution.  It was
he who delivered the denunciation of Liu Shaoqi as an "American spy."
He met almost daily with the Red Guards and the Rebels and issued
orders to them.

When a majority of the Politburo and the country's marsh Ms tried to
put a halt to the Cultural Revolution in February 1967 Zhou did not
give them his support.  He was Mao's faithful servant.  But perhaps he
had acted as he did

The Death of Mr.  Father 053 in order to prevent an even more
horrendous disaster, like a civil war, which an open challenge to Mao
could have brought on.  By keeping China running, he made it possible
for Mao to wreak havoc on it, but probably also saved the country from
total collapse.  He protected a number of people as far as he judged
safe, including, for a time, m?

father, as well as some of China's most important cultural monuments.
It seemed that he had been caught up in an insoluble moral dilemma,
although this does not exclude the possibility that survival was his
priority.  He must have known that if he had tried to stand up to Mao,
he would have been crushed.

The campus became a spectacular sea of white paper wreaths and mourning
posters and couplets.  Everyone wore a black arm band a white paper
flower on their chest, and a sorrowful expression.  The mourning was
par fly spontaneous and partly organized.  Because it was generally
known that at the time of his death Zhou had been under attack from the
Gang of Four, and because the Gang had ordered the mourning for him to
be played down, showing grief at his death was a way for both the
general public and the local authorities to show their disapproval of
the Gang.

But there were many who mourned Zhou for very different reasons.  Ming
and other student officials from my course extolled Zhou's alleged
contribution to 'suppressing the counterrevolutionary Hungarian
uprising in 1956," his hand in establishing Mao's prestige as a world
leader, and his absolute loyalty to Mao.

Outside the campus, there were more encouraging sparks of dissent.  In
the streets of Chengdu, graffiti appeared on the margins of the wall
posters and large crowds gathered, craning their necks to read the tiny
handwriting.  One poster read,

The sky is now dark, A great star is fallen... Scribbled in the margin
were the words: "How could the sky be dark: what about "the red, red
sun"?"  (meaning Mao).  Another graffito appeared on a wall slogan
reading "Deep-fry the persecutors of Premier Zhou!"  It said: "Your
monthly ration of cooking oil is only two liang [3.2 ounces].  What
would you use to fry these persecutors with?"  For the first time in
ten years, I saw irony and humor publicly displayed, which sent my
spirits soaring.

Mao appointed an ineffectual nobody called Hua Guofeng to succeed Zhou,
and launched a campaign to 'denounce Deng and hit back against a
right-wing comeback."  The Gang of Four published Deng Xiaoping's
speeches as targets for denunciation.  In one speech in 1975, Deng had
admitted that peasants in Yan'an were worse off than when the
Communists first arrived there after the Long March forty years before.
In another, he had said that a Party boss should say to the
professionals, "I follow, you lead."  In yet another, he had outlined
his plans for improving living standards, for allowing more freedom,
and for ending political victimization.  Comparing these documents to
the Gang of Four's actions made Deng a folk hero and brought people's
loathing of the Gang to the boiling point.  I thought incredulously:
they seem to hold the Chinese population in such contempt that they
assume we will hate Deng rather than admire him after reading these
speeches, and what is more, that we will love them!

In the university, we were ordered to denounce Deng in endless mass
meetings.  But most people showed passive resistance, and wandered
around the auditorium, or chatted, knitted, read, or even slept during
the ritual theatrics.

The speakers read their prepared scripts in flat, expressionless,
almost inaudible voices.

Because Deng came from Sichuan, there were numerous rumors about him
having been sent back to Chengdu for exile.  I often saw crowds lining
the streets because they had heard he was about to pass by.  On some
occasions the crowds numbered tens of thousands.

At the same time, there was more and more public animosity toward the
Gang of Four, also known as the Gang from Shanghai.  Suddenly bicycles
and other goods made in Shanghai stopped selling.  When the Shanghai
football team came to Chengdu they were booed all the way through the
game.  Crowds gathered outside the stadium and shouted abuse at them as
they went in and came out.

Acts of protest broke out all over China, and reached their peak during
the Tomb-Sweeping Festival in spring 1976, when the Chinese
traditionally pay their respects to the dead.  In Peking, hundreds of
thousands of citizens gathered for days on end in Tiananmen Square to
mourn Zhou with specially crafted weaths, passionate poetry readings,
and speeches.  In symbolism and language which, though coded, everyone
understood, they poured out their hatred of the Gang of Four, and even
of Mao.  The protest was crushed on the night of 5 April, when the
police attacked the crowds, arresting hundreds.  Mao and the Gang of
Four called this a "Hungarian-type counterrevolutionary rebellion."
Deng Xiaoping, who was being held incommunicado, was accused of
stage-managing the demonstrations, and was labeled "China's Nagy' (Nagy
was the Hungarian prime minister in 1956).  Mao officially fired Deng,
and intensified the campaign against him.

The demonstration may have been suppressed and ritually condemned in
the media, but the fact that it had taken place at all changed the mood
of China.  This was the first large-scale open challenge to the regime
since it was founded in 1949.

In June 1976 my class was packed off for a month to a factory in the
mountains to 'learn from the workers."  When the month was up, I went
with some friends to climb the lovely Mount Emei, "Beauty's Eyebrow,"
to the west of Chengdu.  On our way down the mountain, on 28 July, we
heard a loud transistor radio which a tourist was carrying.

I had always felt intensely annoyed by some people's insatiable love
for this propaganda machine.  And in a scenic spot!  As though our cars
had not suffered enough with all the blaring nonsense from the
ever-present loudspeakers.  But this time something caught my
attention.

There had been an earthquake at a coal-mining city near Peking called
Tangshan.  I realized it must be an unprecedented disaster, because the
media normally did not report bad news.  The official figure was
242,000 dead and 164,000 badly injured.

Although they filled the press with propaganda about their concern for
the victims, the Gang of Four warned that the nation must not be
diverted by the earthquake and forget the priority: to 'denounce Deng."
Mme Mao said publicly, "There were merely several hundred thousand
deaths.  So what?  Denouncing Deng Xiaoping concerns eight hundred
million people."  Even from Mine Mao, this sounded too outrageous to be
true, but it was officially relayed to us.

There were numerous earthquake alerts in the Chengdu area, and when I
returned from Mount Emei I went with my mother and Xiao-fang to
Chongqing, which was considered safer.  My sister, who remained in
Chengdu, slept under a massive thick oak table covered in blankets and
quilts.  Officials organized people to erect makeshift sha~, and
detailed teams to keep a round-the-clock watch on the behavior of
various animals which were thought to possess earthquake-predicting
powers.  But followers of the Gang of Four put up wall slogans barking
"Be alert to Deng Xiaoping's criminal attempt to exploit earthquake
phobia to suppress revolution!"  and held a rally to 'solemnly condemn
the capitalist-roaders who use the fear of an earthquake to sabotage
the denunciation of Deng."  The rally was a flop.

I returned to Chengdu at the beginning of September, by which time the
earthquake scare was subsiding.  On the afternoon of 9 September 1976 I
was attending an English class.  At about 2:40 we were told that there
would be an important broadcast at three o'clock that we were all to
assemble in the courtyard to listen.  We had had to do such things
before, and I walked outside in a state of irritation.

It was a typically cloudy autumn Chengdu day.  I heard the rustling of
bamboo leaves along the walls.  Just before three, while the
loudspeaker was making scratching noises as it tuned up, the Party
secretary of our department took up a position in front of the
assembly.

She looked at us sadly, and in a low, halting voice, choked out the
words: "Our Great Leader Chairman Mao, His Venerable Reverence
[ta-lao-ren-jia] has..."

Suddenly, I realized that Mao was dead.

28.  Fighting to Take Wing (1976-1978)

The news filled me with such euphoria that for an instant I was numb.
My ingrained self-censorship immediately started working: I registered
the fact that there was an orgy of weeping going on around me, and that
I had to come up with some suitable performance.  There seemed nowhere
to hide my lack of correct emotion except the shoulder of the woman in
front of me, one of the student officials, who was apparently
heartbroken.  I swiftly buried my head in her shoulder and heaved
appropriately.  As so often in China, a bit of ritual did the trick.
Sniveling heartily she made a movement as though she was going to turn
around and embrace me I pressed my whole weight on her from behind to
keep her in her place, hoping to give the impression that I was in a
state of abandoned grief.

In the days after Mao's death, I did a lot of thinking.  I knew he was
considered a philosopher, and I tried to think what his 'philosophy'
really was.  It seemed to me that its central principle was the need or
the desire?  for perpetual conflict.  The core of his thinking seemed
to be that human struggles were the motivating force of history and
that in order to make history 'class enemies' had to be continuously
created en masse.  I wondered whether there were any other philosophers
whose theories had led to the suffering and death of so many.  I
thought of the terror and misery to which the Chinese population had
been subjected.  For what?

But Mao's theory might just be the extension of his personality.  He
was, it seemed to me, really a restless fight promoter by nature, and
good at it.  He understood ugly human instincts such as envy and
resentment, and knew how to mobilize them for his ends.  He ruled by
getting people to hate each other.  In doing so, he got ordinary
Chinese to carry out many of the tasks undertaken in other
dictatorships by professional elites.  Mao had managed to turn the
people into the ultimate weapon of dictatorship.

That was why under him there was no real equivalent of the KGB in
China.  There was no need.  In bringing out and nourishing the worst in
people, Mao had created a moral wasteland and a land of hatred.  But
how much individual responsibility ordinary people should share, I
could not decide.

The other hallmark of Maoism, it seemed to me, was the reign of
ignorance.  Because of his calculation that the cultured class were an
easy target for a population that was largely illiterate, because of
his own deep resentment of formal education and the educated, because
of his megalomania, which led to his scorn for the great figures of
Chinese culture, and because of his contempt for the areas of Chinese
civilization that he did not understand, such as architecture, art, and
music, Mao destroyed much of the country's cultural heritage.  He left
behind not only a brutalized nation, but also an ugly land with lit He
of its past glory remaining or appreciated.

The Chinese seemed to be mourning Mao in a heartfelt fashion.  But I
wondered how many of their tears were genuine.  People had practiced
acting to such a degree that they confused it with their true feelings.
Weeping for Mao was perhaps just another programmed act in their
programmed lives.

Yet the mood of the nation was unmistakably against continuing Mao's
policies.  Less than a month after his death, on 6 October, Mme Mao was
arrested, along with the other members of the Gang of Four.  They had
no support from anyone not the army, not the police, not even their own
guards.  They had had only Mao.  The Gang of Four had held power only
because it was really a Gang of Five.

When I heard about the ease with which the Four had been removed, I
felt a wave of sadness.  How could such a small group of second-rate
tyrants ravage 900 million people for so long?  But my main feeling was
joy.  The last tyrants of the Cultural Revolution were finally gone. My
rapture was widely shared.  Like many of my countrymen, I went out to
buy the best liquors for a celebration with my family and friends, only
to find the shops out of stock there was so much spontaneous
rejoicing.

There were official celebrations as well exactly the same kinds of
rallies as during the Cultural Revolution, which infuriated me.  I was
particularly angered by the fact that in my department, the political
supervisors and the student officials were now arranging the whole
show, with unperturbed self-righteousness.

The new leadership was headed by Mao's chosen successor, Hua Guofeng,
whose only qualification, I believed, was his mediocrity.  One of his
first acts was to announce the construction of a huge mausoleum for Mao
on Tiananmen Square.  I was outraged: hundreds of thousands of people
were still homeless after the earthquake in Tangshan, living in
temporary shacks on the pavements.

With her experience, my mother had immediately seen that a new era was
beginning.  On the day after Mao's death she had reported for work at
her depas'uuent.  She had been at home for five years, and now she
wanted to put her energy to use again.  She was given a job as the
number seven deputy director in her department, of which she had been
the director before the Cultural Revolution.  But she did not mind.

To me in my impatient mood, things seemed to go on as before.  In
January 1977, my university course came to an end.  We were given
neither examinations nor degrees.

Although Mao and the Gang of Four were gone, Mao's rule that we had to
return to where we had come from still applied.  For me, this meant the
machinery factory.  The idea that a university education should make a
difference to one's job had been condemned by Mao as 'training
spiritual aristocrats."

I was desperate to avoid being sent back to the factory.

If that happened, I would lose any chance of using my English: there
would be nothing to translate, and no one to speak the language with.
Once again, I turned to my mother.  She said there was only one way
out: the factory had to refuse to take me back.  My friends at the
factory persuaded the management to write a report to the Second Bureau
of Light Industry saying that, although I was a good worker, they
realized they should sacrifice their own interests for a greater cause:
our motherland would benefit from my English.

After this florid letter went off, my mother sent me to see the chief
manager of the bureau, a Mr.  Hui.  He had been a colleague of hers,
and had been very fond of me when I was a baby.  My mother knew he
still had a soft spot for me.  The day after I went to see him, a board
meeting of his bureau was convened to discuss my case.  The board
consisted of some twenty directors, all of whom had to meet to make any
decision, however trivial.  Mr.  Hui managed to convince them that I
should be given a chance to use my English, and they wrote a formal
letter to my university.

Although my depa~iment had given me a hard time, they needed teachers,
and in January 19771 became an assistant lecturer in English at Sichuan
University.  I had mixed feelings about working there, as I would have
to live on the campus, under the eyes of political supervisors and
ambitious and jealous colleagues.  Worse, I soon learned that I was not
to have anything to do with my profession for a year.  A week after my
appointment I was sent to the countryside on the outskirts of Chengdu,
as part of my 'reeducation' program.

I labored in the fields and sat through endless tedious meetings.
Boredom, dissatisfaction, and the pressure put on me for not having a
fiance at the advanced age of twenty-five helped push me into
infatuations with a couple of men.  One of them I had never met, but he
wrote me beautiful letters.  I fell out of love the moment I set eyes
on him.  The other, Hou, had actually been a Rebel leader.

He was a kind of product of the times: brilliant and unscrupulous.  I
was dazzled by his charm.

Hou was detained in the summer of 1977 when a campaign started to
apprehend 'the followers of the Gang of Four."  These were defined as
the 'heads of the Rebels' and anyone who had engaged in criminal
violence, which was vaguely described as including torture, murder, and
destruction or looting of state property.  The campaign petered out
within months.  The main reason was that Mao was not repudiated, nor
was the Cultural Revolution as such.  Anyone who had done evil simply
claimed that they had acted out of loyalty to Mao.  There were no clear
criteria to judge criminality either, except in the case of the most
blatant murderers and torturers.  So many had been involved in house
raids, in destroying historical sites, antiques, and books, and in the
factional fighting.  The greatest horror of the Cultural Revolution the
crushing repression which had driven hundreds of thousands of people to
mental breakdown, suicide, and death was carried out by the population
collectively.  Almost everyone, including young children, had
participated in brutal denunciation meetings.  Many had lent a hand in
beating the victims.  What was more, victims had often become
victimizers, and vice versa.

There was also no independent legal system to investigate and to judge.
Party officials decided who was to be punished and who was not.
Personal feelings were often the decisive factor.  Some Rebels were
rightly punished.

Some got rough justice.  Others were let off lightly.  Of my father's
main persecutors, nothing happened to Zuo, and MrsShau was simply
transferred to a slightly less desirable job.

The Tings had been detained since 1970, but were not now brought to
justice because the Party had not issued criteria by which they could
be judged.  The only thing that happened to them was having to sit
through nonviolent meetings at which victims could 'speak bitterness'
against them.  My mother spoke at one such mass meeting about how the
couple had persecuted my father.  The Tings were to remain in detention
without trial until 1982, when Mr.  Ting was given twenty years'
imprisonment and Mrs.  Ting seventeen.

Hou, over whose detention I had lost much sleep, was soon set free. But
the bitter emotions reawakened in those brief days of reckoning had
killed whatever feeling I had for him.  Although I was never to know
his exact responsibility, it was clear that as a mass Red Guard leader
in the most savage years he could not possibly have been guiltless.

I still could not make myself hate him personally, but I was no longer
sorry for him.  I hoped that justice would be done to him, and to all
those who deserved it.

When would that day come?  Could justice ever be done?

And could this be achieved without more bitterness and animosity being
stirred up, given that there was so much steam already?  All around me,
factions that had fought bloody wars against each other now cohabited
under the same roof.  Capitalist-roaders were obliged to work side by
side with former Rebels who had denounced and tormented them.  The
country was still in a state of extreme tension.  When, if ever, would
we be rid of the nightmare cast by Mao?

In July 1977 Deng Xiaoping was rehabilitated again and made deputy to
Hua Guofeng.  Every speech by Deng was a blast of fresh air.  Political
campaigns were to end.  Political 'studies' were 'exorbitant taxes and
levies' and must be stopped.  Party policies must be based on reality,
not dogma.  And most importantly, it was wrong to follow every word of
Mao's to the letter.  Deng was changing China's course.  Then I started
to suffer from anxiety: I so feared that this new future might never
come to pass.

In the new spirit of Deng, the end of my sentence in the commune came
in December 1977, one month short of the original one-year schedule.
This difference of a mere month thrilled me beyond reason.  When I got
back to Chengdu, the university was about to hold belated entrance
examinations for 1977, the first proper examinations since 1966.  Deng
had declared that university entrance must be through academic exams,
not the back door.  The autumn term had had to be postponed because of
the need to prepare the population for the change from Mao's
policies.

I was sent to the mountains of northern Sichuan to interview applicants
for my department.  I went willingly.  It was on this trip, traveling
from county to county on the meandering dusty roads, all on my own,
that a thought first occurred to me: how wonderful it would be to go
and study in the West!

A few years before, a friend of mine had told me a story.

He had originally come to 'the motherland' from Hong Kong in 1964, but
had not been allowed out again until 1973, when, in the openness
following Nixon's visit, he was permitted to go and see his family.  On
his first night in Hong Kong, he heard his niece on the phone to Tokyo
arranging a weekend there.  His apparently inconsequential story had
become a permanent source of perturbation to me.  This freedom to see
the world, a freedom I could not dream of, tormented me.  Because it
had been impossible, my desire to go abroad had always remained firmly
imprisoned in my subconscious.  There had been odd scholarships to the
West at some other universities in the past, but, of course, the
candidates had all been chosen by the authorities, and Party membership
was a prerequisite.

I had no chance, being neither a Party member nor trusted by my
department, even if a scholarship were to fall from heaven onto my
university.  But now it began to bud somewhere in my mind that since
exams were back, and China was shedding its Maoist straitjacket, I
might have a chance.

Hardly had I begun to dream this than I forced myself to kill the idea,
I was so afraid of the inevitable disappointment.

When I came back from my trip, I heard that my department had been
given a scholarship for a young or middleaged teacher to go to the
West.  And they had decided on someone else.

It was Professor Lo who told me the devastafng news.

She was in her early seventies and walked unsteadily with a stick, but
was nonetheless perky and almost impetuously quick in every other way.
She spoke English rapidly, as if she was impatient to get out all the
things she knew.  She had lived in the United States for about thirty
years.  Her father had been a Kuomintang high court judge, and had
wanted to give her a Western upbringing.  In America she had taken the
name Lucy, and had fallen in love with an American student called Luke.
They planned to get married, but when they told Luke's mother, she
said, "Lucy, I like you very much.  But what would your children look
like?  It would be very difficult .... '

Lucy broke with Luke because she was too proud to be accepted into his
family with reluctance.  At the beginning of the 195os, after the
Communists took over, she went back to China, thinking that at last the
dignity of the Chinese would be restored.  She never got over Luke, and
entered into a very late marriage with a Chinese professor of English,
whom she did not love, and they quarreled nonstop.  They had been
thrown out of their apa,iment during the Cultural Revolution and were
living in a tiny room, about ten feet by eight, crammed with fading old
papers and dusty books.  It was heart-rending to see this frail
white-haired couple, unable to bear each other, one sitting on the edge
of their double bed, the other on the only chair that could be squeezed
into the room.

Professor Lo became very fond of me.  She said she saw in me her own
vanished youth of fifty years before when she had also been restless,
wanting happiness out of life.

She had failed to find it, she told me, but she wanted me to succeed.
When she heard about the scholarship to go abroad, probably to America,
she was terribly excited, but also anxious because I was away and could
not stake my claim.  The place went to a Miss Yee, who had been one
year ahead of me and was now a Party official.  She and the other young
teachers in my deparhnent who had been graduated since the Cultural
Revolution had been put in a training scheme to improve their English
while I was in the countryside.  Professor Lo was one of their tutors;
she taught partly by using articles from English-language publications
she had procured from friends in the more open cities like Peking and
Shanghai (Sichuan was still completely closed to foreigners).  Whenever
I was back from the country, I sat in on her classes.

One day the text was about the use of atomic energy in US industry.
After Professor Lo explained the meaning of the article, Miss Yee
looked up, straightened her back, and said with great indignation,
"This article has to be read critically!  How can the American
imperialists use atomic energy peacefully?"  I felt my irritation
flaring up at Miss Yee's parroting of the propaganda line.  Impulsively
I retorted, "But how do you know they can't.}' Miss Yee and most of the
class stared at me incredulously.  To them, a question like mine was
still inconceivable, even blasphemous.  Then I saw the sparkle in
Professor Lo's eyes, the smile of appreciation that only I could
detect.  I felt understood and for lifted

Besides Professor Lo, some other professors and lecturers wanted me,
not Miss Yee, to go to the West.  But although they had begun to be
respected in the new climate, none of them had any say.  If anyone
could help, it had to be my mother.  Following her advice, I went to
see my father's former colleagues, who were now in charge of
universities, and told them I had a complaint: since Comrade Deng
Xiaoping had said that university entrance was to be based on merit,
not the back door, surely it was wrong not to follow this procedure for
studying overseas.  I begged them to allow me a fair competition, which
meant an exam.

while my mother and I were lobbying, an order suddenly came from
Peking: for the first time since 1949, scholarships for studying in the
West were to be awarded on the basis of a national academic
examination, and it was soon to be held simultaneously in Peking,
Shanghai, and Xi'an, the ancient capital where the terra-cotta army was
later excavated.

My deparunent had to send three candidates to Xi'an.

It withdrew Miss Yee's scholarship and chose two candidates, both
excellent lecturers around the age of forty, who had been teaching
since before the Cultural Revolution.

Partly because of Peking's order to base selection on professional
ability, and partly because of the pressure from my mother's campaign,
the depa~hnent decided that the third candidate, a younger one, should
be chosen from among the two dozen people who were graduated during the
Cultural Revolution, through a written and an oral examination on x8
March.

I received the highest marks in both, although I won the oral test
somewhat irregularly.  We had to go one at a time into a room where two
examiners, Professor Lo and another elderly professor, were seated.  On
a table in front of them were some paper balls: we had to pick one and
answer the question on it in English.  Mine read: 'what are the main
points in the communiqu~ of the recent Second Plenary Session of the
Eleventh Congress of the

Communist Party of China?"  Of course I had no idea, and stood there
stupefied.  Professor Lo looked into my face and stretched out her hand
for the slip of paper.  She glanced at it and showed it to the other
professor.  Silently she put it in her pocket and motioned with her
eyes for me to pick another.  This time the question was: "Say
something about the glorious situation of our socialist motherland."

Years of compulsory exaltation of the glorious situation of my
socialist motherland had bored me sick, but this time I had plenty to
say.  In fact, I had just written a rapturous poem about the spring of
x 978.  Deng Xiaoping's right-hand man, Hu Yaobang, had become head of
the Party's organization Department, and had begun the process of
clearing all sorts of' class enemies' en masse.  The country was
palpably shaking off Maoism.  Industry was going at full blast and
there were many more goods in the shops.  Schools, hospitals, and other
public services were working properly.  Long-banned books were being
published, and people sometimes waited outside book shops for two days
to obtain them.  There was laughter, on the streets and in people's
homes.

I began to prepare frantically for the examinations in Xi'an, which
were not quite three weeks away.  Several professors offered their
help.  Professor Lo gave me a reading list and a dozen English books,
but then decided I would not have time to read them all.  So she
briskly cleared a space on her crowded desk for her portable
typewriter, and spent the next two weeks typing out summaries of them
in English.  This, she said with a mischievous wink, was how Luke had
helped her with her examinations fifty years before, as she had
preferred dancing and parties.

The two lecturers and I, accompanied by the deputy

Party secretary, took a train to Xi'an, a day and a night's journey
away.  For most of the journey I lay on my stomach on my 'hard
sleeper," busily annotating Professor Lo's pile of notes.  No one knew
the exact number of scholarships or the countries for which the winners
were destined, as most information in China was a state secret.  But
when we arrived in Xi'an we heard that there were twenty-two people
taking the exams there, mostly senior lecturers from four provinces in
western China.  The sealed exam paper had been flown in from Peking the
day before.  There were three parts to the written exam, which took up
the morning;

one was a long passage from Roots, which we had to translate into
Chinese.  Outside the windows of the examination hall, white showers of
willow flowers swept across the April city as if in a magnificent
rhapsodic dance.  At the end of the morning, our papers were collected,
sealed, and sent straight to Peking to be marked together with the ones
done there and in Shanghai.  In the afternoon there was an oral exam.

At the end of May I was told unofficially that I had come through both
exams with distinction.  As soon as she heard the news, my mother
stepped up her campaign to get my father's name cleared.  Although he
was dead, his file still continued to decide the future of his
children.  It contained the draft verdict which said he had committed
'serious political errors."  My mother knew that even though China was
beginning to become more liberal, this would still disqualify me from
going abroad.

She lobbied my father's former colleagues, who were now back in power
in the provincial government, backing up her case with the note from
Zhou Enlai which said that my father had the right to petition Mao.
This note had been hidden with great ingenuity by my grandmother,
stitched into the cotton upper of one of her shoes.  Now, eleven years
after Zhou had given it to her, my mother decided to hand it to the
provincial authorities, who were now headed by Zhao Ziyang.

It was a propitious time Mao's spell was beginning to lose its
paralyzing power, with considerable help from Hu Yaobang, who was in
charge of rehabilitations.  On 12 June, a senior official turned up at
Meteorite Street bearing the Party's verdict on my father.  He handed
my mother a flimsy piece of paper on which it was written that Father
had been 'a good official and a good Party member."  This marked his
official rehabilitation.  It was only after this that my scholarship
was finally endorsed by the Education Ministry in Peking.

The news that I was to go to Britain reached me through excited friends
in the department before the authorities told me.  People who barely
knew me felt hugely pleased for me, and I received many letters and
telegrams of congratulations.  Celebration parties were thrown, and
many tears of joy were shed.  It was a gigantic thing to go to the
West.  China had been closed for decades, and everyone felt stifled by
the airlessness.  I was the first person from my university and, as far
as I know, the first person from the whole of Sichuan (which then had a
population of about ninety million) to be allowed to study in the West
since 1949.  And I had earned this on professional merit I was not even
a Party member.  It was another sign of the dramatic changes sweeping
the country.  People saw hope and opportunities opening up.

But I was not entirely overwhelmed with excitement.  I had achieved
something so desirable and so unobtainable for everyone else around me
that I felt guilty toward my friends.  To show elation seemed
embarrassing or even cruel to them, but to conceal it would have been
dishonest.

So subconsciously I opted for a subdued mood.  I also felt sad when I
thought about how narrow and monolithic

China was so many people had been denied opportunities and their
talents had had no outlet.  I knew that I was lucky to come from a
privileged family, much though it had suffered.  Now that a more open
and fair China was on its way, I was impatient for change to come
faster and transform the whole society.

Wrapped up in my own thoughts, I went through the inescapable rigmarole
connected with leaving China in those days.  First I had to go to
Peking for a special training course for people going abroad.  We had a
month of

Fighting to Take Wing 67x indoctrination sessions, followed by a month
traveling around China.  The point was to impress us with the beauty of
the motherland so we would not contemplate defecting.

All the arrangements for going abroad were made for us, and we were
given a clothing allowance.  We had to look smart for the foreigners.

The Silk River meandered past the campus, and I often wandered along
its banks on my last evenings.  Its surface glimmered in the moonlight
and the hazy mist of the summer night.  I contemplated my twenty-six
years.  I had experienced privilege as well as denunciation, courage as
well as fear, seen kindness and loyalty as well as the depths of human
ugliness.  Amid suffering, ruin, and death, I had above all known love
and the indestructible human capacity to survive and to pursue
happiness.

All sorts of emotions swept over me, particularly when I thought of my
father, as well as my grandmother and Aunt Jun-ying.  Until then I had
tried to suppress my memories of them, as their deaths had remained the
most painful spot in my heart.  Now I pictured how delighted and proud
they would be for me.

I flew to Peking and was to travel with thirteen other university
teachers, one of whom was the political supervisor.  Our plane was due
to leave at 8 p.m. on 11 September 1978, and I almost missed it,
because some friends had come to say goodbye at Peking Airport and I
did not feel I should keep looking at my watch.  When I was finally
slumped in my seat, I realized I had hardly given my mother a proper
hug.  She had come to see me off at Chengdu Airport, almost casually,
with no trace of tears, as though my going half a globe away was just
one more episode in our eventful lives.

As I left China farther and farther behind, I looked out of the window
and saw a great universe beyond the plane's silver wing.  I took one
more glance over my past life, then turned to the future.  I was eager
to embrace the world.

Epilogue

I have made London my home.  For ten years, I avoided thinking about
the China I had left behind.  Then in 1988, my mother came to England
to visit me.  For the first time, she told me the story of her life and
that of my grandmother.  When she returned to Chengdu, I sat down and
let my own memory surge out and the unshed tears flood my mind.  I
decided to write Wild Swans.  The past was no longer too painful to
recall because I had found love and fulfillment and therefore
tranquillity.

China has become an altogether different place since I left.  At the
end of 1978, the Communist Party dumped Mao's 'class struggle."  Social
outcasts, including the 'class enemies' in my book, were rehabilitated;
among them were my mother's friends from Manchuria who had been branded
counterrevolution ari in 1955.  Official discrimination against them
and their families stopped.  They were able to leave their hard
physical labor, and were given much better jobs.  Many were invited
into the Communist Party and made officials.  Yu-lin, my great-uncle,
and his wife and children were allowed back to Jinzhou from the
countryside in 198o.  He became the chief accountant in a medicine
company, and she the headmistress of a kindergarten.

674 Epilogue

Verdicts clearing the victims were drawn up and lodged in their files.
The old incriminating records were taken out and burned.  In every
organization across China, bonfires were lit to consume these flimsy
pieces of paper that had ruined countless lives.

My mother's file was thick with suspicion about her teenage connections
with the Kuomintang.  Now all the dan ming words went up in flames.  In
their place was a two-page verdict dated zo December 1978, which said
in unambiguous terms that the accusations against her were false.  As a
bonus, it redefined her family background:

rather than the undesirable 'warlord," it now became the more innocuous
'doctor."

In 1982, when I decided to stay in Britain, it was still a very
unusutal choice.  Thinking it might cause dilemmas in her job, my
mother applied for early retirement, and was granted it, in 1983.  But
a daughter living in the West did not bring her trouble, as would
certainly have been the case under Mao.

The door of China has been opening wider and wider.

My three brothers are all in the West now.  Jin-ming, who is an
internationally recognized scientist in a branch of solid-state
physics, is carrying out research at Southampton University in England.
Xiao-her, who became a journalist after leaving the air force, works in
London.  Both of them are married, with a child each.  Xiao-fang
obtained a master's degree in international trade from Strasbourg
University in France, and is now a businessman with a French company.

My sister, Xiao-hong, is the only one of us still in China.

She works in the administration of the Chengdu College of Chinese
Medicine.  When a private sector was first allowed in the 198os, she
took a two-year leave of absence to help set up a clothes design
company, which was something she had set her heart on.  When her leave
was up, she had to choose between the excitement and risk of private
business and the routine and security of her state

post.  She chose the latter.  Her husband, Specs, is an executive in a
local bank.

Communication with the outside world has become part of everyday life.
A letter gets from Chengdu to London in a week.  My mother can send me
faxes from a downtown post office.  I phone her at home, direct dial,
from wherever I am in the world.  There is filtered foreign media news
on television every day, side by side with official propaganda.

Major world events, including the revolutions and upheavals in Eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union, are reported.

Between 1983 and 1989, I went back to visit my mother every year, and
each time I was overwhelmed by the dramatic diminution of the one thing
that had most characterized life under Mao: fear.

In spring 1989 I traveled around China researching this book.  I saw
the buildup of demonstrations from Chengdu to Tiananmen Square.  It
struck me that fear had been forgotten to such an extent that few of
the millions of demonstrators perceived danger.  Most seemed to be
taken by surprise when the army opened fire.  Back in London, I could
hardly believe my eyes when I saw the killing on television.  Was it
really ordered by the same man who had been to me and to so many others
a liberator?

Fear made a tentative comeback, but without the all pervasive and
crushing force of the Maoist days.  In political meetings today, people
openly criticize Party leaders by name.  The course of liberalization
is irreversible.  Yet Mao's face still stares down on Tiananmen
Square.

The economic reforms of the 198os brought an unprecedented rise in the
standard of living, par fly thanks to foreign trade and investmenc

One day, my mother spotted one such visitor coming out of a banquet,
surrounded by a flattering crowd to whom he was showing off photographs
of his luxury house and cars in Taiwan.  It was Yao-han, the Kuomintang
political supervisor at her school who, forty years earlier, had been
responsible for her arrest.

May 1991The End...........

Burps:

"It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of this book."  Mary
Wesley

"Of all the personal histories to have emerged out of China's
twentieth-century nightmare, WILD SWANS is the most deeply thoughtful
and the most heart-rending I've read.  It moves, in part, like a
ghastly oriental fairytale, but the authority and the reticent passion
with which Jung Chang speaks her memories and those of others is
unmistakable."  Colin Thubron, SPECTATOR

"WILD SWANS' is a very unusual masterpiece.  Everything about it is
extraordinary.  Not only has it been a popular bestseller, because it
is impossible to put down; it has also received the most serious
critical attention.  The book arouses all the emotions, such s pity and
terror, that great tragedy is supposed to evoke, and also a complex
mixture of admiration, despair and delight at seeing a luminous
intelligence directed at the heart of darkness."  - Minette Marrin,

SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

"Mesmerising.  Like all great stories of survival, no matter what
tragedies and horrors are encountered along the way, WILD SWANS is
ultimately an uplifting book: it is the courage and spirit of this
family which will, I believe, be my abiding impression (even if
memories of the horrors endured will take

(even if memories of the horrors endured will take a long time to
fade)."  Antonia Fraser.  THE TIMES

Immensely moving and unsettling: an unforgettable portrait of the
brain-death of a nation."  J.G. Ballard: SUNDAY TIMES
"A quite exceptional book.  Jung Chang is the classic storyteller,
describing in measured tones the almost unbelievable."

PENELOPE FITZGERALD, London Review of Books "Wild Swans has stayed in my mind all year.  Quite unforgettable."

MICHAEL IGNATIEFF, Times Literary Supplement

"An extraordinary story, popular history at its most compelling.

Her readiness to record life's small pleasures as well as its looming
horrors is not only an index of Jung Chang's honesty and good humour,
it is a part of what makes Wild Swans so fascinating.  To compare
Wild Swans to sagas of the kind that fill the bestseller lists may seem
to trivialise the real and deadly seriousness of its subject matter,
but the book offers many of the pleasures of good historical fiction."
LUCY HUGHES-HAL LET Independent

"Remarkable.  A truly splendid book."

CLARE HOLLINGWORTH, Dai~ Telegraph "Wild Swans made me feel like a
five-year-old.  This is a family memoir that has the breadth of the
most enduring social history."

MARTIN Aais, Independent on Sunday

"Riveting, an extraordinary epic.  A work of true, living history
drawing deep on family memories, an un matchable insight into the
making of modern China and the impact of war and totalitarianism on the
destinies of a quarter of the human race."

RICHARD HELLER~ Mail on Sunday

"An extraordinary tale, a loving family saga told against a background
of chaos and death rarely equalled in this century.  Wild Swans is
about how people cope with the unimaginable, and how some, in spite of
the horror, manage to remain human.  It is a remarkable book." CAROLINE
MOORE HEAD Ntw Startsman "This real-life saga of a Chinese family over
three generations contains more domestic drama than Dynast, more
violence than any film noir, more heart-rending tragedy than Little
Dottit and more ironic twists and turns and villains on the make than
any Balzacian fresco.  Almost casually, Jung Chang introduces us to a
world where personal insecurity, sudden ruin and the possibility of
torture and violent death are as perfunctorily taken for granted as
tomorrow's thunderstorm.  There has never been a book like this."

EDWARD BEHI~ Los Angeles Times

"If you care at all about the history of China in the twentieth century
or even if you don't, come to think of it Wild Swans is riveting.

It's blindingly good: a mad adventure story, a fairy tale of courage, a
tall tale of atrocities and incidentally a meditation on how men will
never understand women and vice versa.  This is calm and measured
history, but it reads like a bestseller.  You can't, as they say, put
it down."  CAROLYN SEE, New York Newsday

"If there remains the slightest doubt about the tragic quality of life
in the China of this century, this memoir should put it definitively to

1. "Three-Inch Golden Ulies'-Concubine to a Warlord General
(1gOg-1955)

At the age of fifteen my grandmother became the concubine of a warlord
general, the police chief of a tenuous national government of China.
The year was 1924 and China was in chaos.  Much of it, including
Manchuria, where my grandmother lived, was ruled by warlords.  The
liaison was arranged by her father, a police official in the provincial
town of Yixian in southwest Manchuria, about a hundred miles north of
the Great Wall and 250 miles northeast of Peking.

Like most towns in China, Yixian was built like a fortress.  It was
encircled by walls thirty feet high and twelve feet thick dating from
the Tang dynasty (AD 618-9o7), surmounted by battlements, dotted with
sixteen forts at regular intervals, and wide enough to ride a horse
quite easily along the top.  There were four gates into the city, one
at each point of the compass, with outer protecting gates, and the
fortifications were surrounded by a deep moat.

The town's most conspicuous feature was a tall, richly decorated bell
tower of dark brown stone, which had originally been built in the sixth
century when Buddhism had

28 "Three-Inch Golden Lilies' been introduced to the area.  Every night
the bell was rung to signal the time, and the tower also functioned as
a fire and flood alarm.  Yixian was a prosperous market town.

The plains around produced cotton, maize, sorghum, soybeans, sesame,
pears, apples, and grapes.  In the grassland areas and in the hills to
the west, farmers grazed sheep and cat He

My great-grandfather, Yang Ru-shan, was born in 1894, when the whole of
China was ruled by an emperor who resided in Peking.  The imperial
family were Manchus who had conquered China in 1644 from Manchuria,
which was their base.  The Yangs were Han, ethnic Chinese, and had
ventured north of the Great Wall in search of opportunity.

My great-grandfather was the only son, which made him of supreme
importance to his family.  Only a son could perpetuate the family name
without him, the family line would stop, which, to the Chinese,
amounted to the greatest possible betrayal of one's ancestors.  He was
sent to a good school.  The goal was for him to pass the examinations
to become a mandarin, an official, which was the aspiration of most
Chinese males at the time.  Being an official brought power, and power
brought money.  Without power or money, no Chinese could feel safe from
the depredations of officialdom or random violence.  There had never
been a proper legal system.  Justice was arbitrary, and cruelty was
both institutionalized and capricious.  An official with power was the
law.  Becoming a mandarin was the only way the child of a non-noble
family could escape this cycle of injustice and fear.  Yang's father
had decided that his son should not follow him into the family business
of felt-making, and sacrificed himself and his family to pay for his
son's education.  The women took in sewing for local tailors and
dressmakers, toiling late into the night.

To save money, they turned their oil lamps down to the absolute
minimum, causing lasting damage to their eyes.

The joints in their fingers became swollen from the long hours.

Following the custom, my great-grandfather was married young, at
fourteen, to a woman six years his senior.  It was considered one of
the duties of a wife to help bring up her husband.

The story of his wife, my great-grandmother, was typical of millions of
Chinese women of her time.  She came from a family of tanners called
Wu.  Because her family was not an intellectual one and did not hold
any official post, and because she was a girl, she was not given a name
at all.

Being the second daughter, she was simply called "Number Two Girl'
(Er-ya-tou).  Her father died when she was an infant, and she was
brought up by an uncle.  One day, when she was six years old, the uncle
was dining with a friend whose wife was pregnant.  Over dinner the two
men agreed that if the baby was a boy he would be married to the
six-year-old niece.  The two young people never met before their
wedding.  In fact, falling in love was considered almost shameful, a
family disgrace.  Not because it was taboo there was, after all, a
venerable tradition of romantic love in China but because young people
were not supposed to be exposed to situations where such a thing could
happen, partly because it was immoral for them to meet, and partly
because marriage was seen above all as a duty, an arrangement between
two families.  With luck, one could fall in love after getting
married.

At fourteen, and having lived a very sheltered life, my
great-grandfather was little more than a boy at the time of his
marriage.  On the first night, he did not want to go into the wedding
chamber.  He went to bed in his mother's room and had to be carried in
to his bride after he fell asleep.  But, although he was a spoiled
child and still needed help to get dressed, he knew how to 'plant
children," according to his wife.  My grandmother was born within a
year of the wedding, on the fifth day of the fifth moon, in early
summer 19o9.  She was in a better position than her mother, for she was
actually given a name: Yufang.  Yu, meaning 'jade," was her generation
name, given to

30 "Three-Inch Golden Lilies' all the offspring of the same generation,
while fang means 'fragrant flowers."

The world she was born into was one of total unpredictability.  The
Manchu empire, which had ruled China for over 260 years, was tottering.
In x894-95 Japan attacked China in Manchuria, with China suffering
devastating defeats and loss of territory.  In 19OO the nationalist
Boxer Rebellion was put down by eight foreign armies, contingents of
which had stayed on, some in Manchuria and some along the Great Wall.
Then in 19o4-5 Japan and Russia fought a major war on the plains of
Manchuria.

Japan's victory made it the dominant outside force in Manchuria.  In
1911 the five-year-old emperor of China, Pu Yi, was overthrown and a
republic was set up with the charismatic figure of Sun Yat-sen briefly
at its head.

The new republican government soon collapsed and the country broke up
into fiefs.  Manchuria was particularly disaffected from the republic,
since the Manchu dynasty had originated there.  Foreign powers,
especially Japan, intensified their attempts to encroach on the area.
Under all these pressures, the old institutions collapsed, resulting in
a vacuum of power, morality, and authority.  Many people sought to get
to the top by bribing local potentates with expensive gifts like gold,
silver, and jewelry.  My great grandfather was not rich enough to buy
himself a lucrative position in a big city, and by the time he was
thirty he had risen no higher than an official in the police station of
his native Yixian, a provincial backwater.  But he had plans.

And he had one valuable asset his daughter.

My grandmother was a beauty.  She had an oval face, with rosy cheeks
and lustrous skin.  Her long, shiny black hair was woven into a thick
plait reaching down to her waist.

She could be demure when the occasion demanded, which was most of the
time, but underneath her composed exterior she was bursting with
suppressed energy.  She was petite, about five feet three inches, with
a slender figure

Concubine to a Warlord General 3 l and sloping shoulders, which were
considered the ideal.

But her greatest assets were her bound feet, called in Chinese
'three-inch golden lilies' (san-tsun-gin-lian).  This meant she walked
'like a tender young willow shoot in a spring breeze," as Chinese
connoisseurs of women traditionally put it.  The sight of a woman
teetering on bound feet was supposed to have an erotic effect on men,
partly because her vulnerability induced a feeling of protectiveness in
the onlooker.

My grandmother's feet had been bound when she was two years old.  Her
mother, who herself had bound feet, first wound a piece of white cloth
about twenty feet long round her feet, bending all the toes except the
big toe inward and under the sole.  Then she placed a large stone on
top to crush the arch.  My grandmother screamed in agony and begged her
to stop.  Her mother had to stick a cloth into her mouth to gag her. My
grandmother passed out repeatedly from the pain.

The process lasted several years.  Even after the bones had been
broken, the feet had to be bound day and night in thick cloth because
the moment they were released they would try to recover.  For years my
grandmother lived in relentless, excruciating pain.  When she pleaded
with her mother to untie the bindings, her' mother would weep and tell
her that unbound feet would ruin her entire life, and that she was
doing it for her own future happiness.

In those days, when a woman was married, the first thing the
bridegroom's family did was to examine her feet.  Large feet, meaning
normal feet, were considered to bring shame on the husband's household.
The mother-in-law would lift the hem of the bride's long skirt, and if
the feet were more than about four inches long, she would throw down
the skirt in a demonstrative gesture of contempt and stalk off, leaving
the bride to the critical gaze of the wedding guests, who would stare
at her feet and insultingly mutter their disdain.  Sometimes a mother
would take pity on her daughter and remove the binding cloth; but when
the child
grew up and had to endure the contempt of
her husband's family and the disapproval of society, she would blame
her mother for having been too weak.

The practice of binding feet was originally introduced about a thousand
years ago, allegedly by a concubine of the emperor.  Not only was the
sight of women hobbling on tiny feet considered erotic, men would also
get excited playing with bound feet, which were always hidden in
embroidered silk shoes.  Women could not remove the binding cloths even
when they were adults, as their feet would start growing again.  The
binding could only be loosened temporarily at night in bed, when they
would put on soft-soled shoes.  Men rarely saw naked bound feet, which
were usually covered in rot ling flesh and stank when the bindings were
removed.  As a child, I can remember my grandmother being in constant
pain.  When we came home from shopping, the first thing she would do
was soak her feet in a bowl of hot water, sighing with relief as she
did so.  Then she would set about cutting off pieces of dead skin.  The
pain came not only from the broken bones, but also from her toenails,
which grew into the balls of her feet.

In fact, my grandmother's feet were bound just at the moment when
foot-binding was disappearing for good.  By the time her sister was
born in 1917, the practice had virtually been abandoned, so she escaped
the torment.

However, when my grandmother was growing up, the prevailing attitude in
a small town like Yh~a was still that bound feet were essential for a
good marriage but they were only a start.  Her father's plans were for
her to be trained as either a perfect lady or a high-class courtesan.

Scorning the received wisdom of the time that it was virtuous for a
lower class woman to be illiterate he sent her to a girl's school that
had been set up in the town in 19o5.  She also learned to play Chinese
chess, mahjongg, and go.  She studied drawing and embroidery.  Her
favorite design was mandarin ducks (which symbolize love, because they
always swim in pairs), and she used to embroider them onto the tiny
shoes she made for herself.  To crown her list of accomplishments, a
tutor was hired to teach her to play the qin, a musical instrument like
a zither.

My grandmother was considered the belle of the town.

The locals said she stood out 'like a crane among chickens."

In 1924 she was fifteen, and her father was growing worried that time
might be running out on his only real asset and his only chance for a
life of ease.  In that year General Xue Zhi-heng, the inspector general
of the Metropolitan Police of the warlord government in Peking, came to
pay a visit.

Xue Zhi-heng was born in i876 in the county of Lulong, about a hundred
miles east of Peking, and just south of the Great Wall, where the vast
North China plain runs up against the mountains.  He was the eldest of
four sons of a country schoolteacher.

He was handsome and had a powerful presence, which struck all who met
him.  Several blind fortune-tellers who felt his face predicted he
would rise to a powerful position.

He was a gifted calligrapher, a talent held in high esteem, and in 1908
a warlord named Wang Huai-qing, who was visiting Lulong, noticed the
fine calligraphy on a plaque over the gate of the main temple and asked
to meet the man who had done it.  General Wang took to the thirty
two-year-old Xue and invited him to become his aide de -camp.

He proved extremely efficient, and was soon promoted to quartermaster.
This involved extensive traveling, and he started to acquire food shops
of his own around Lulong and on the other side of the Great Wall, in
Manchuria.

His rapid rise was boosted when he helped General Wang to suppress an
uprising in Inner Mongolia.  In almost no time he had amassed a
fortune, and he designed and built for himself an eighty-one-room
mansion at Lulong.

In the decade after the end of the empire, no government established
authority over the bulk of the country.

34 "Three-Inch Golden Lilies' 
Powerful warlords were soon fighting for
control of the central government in Peking.  Xue's faction, headed by
a warlord called Wu Pei-fu, dominated the nominal government in Peking
in the early 1920s.  In 1911 Xue became inspector general of the
Metropolitan Police and joint head of the Public Works Department in
Peking.  He commanded twenty regions on both sides of the Great Wall,
and more than 10,000 mounted police and infantry.  The police job gave
him power; the public works post gave him patronage.

*#06#
Allegiances were fickle.  In May 1923 General Xue's faction decided to
get rid of the president, Li Yuan-hong, whom it had installed in office
only a year earlier.  In league with a general called Feng Yu-xiang, a
Christian warlord, who entered legend by baptizing his troops en masse
with a firehose, Xue mobilized his 10,000 men and surrounded the main
government buildings in Peking, demanding the back pay which the
bankrupt government owed his men.  His real aim was to humiliate
President Li and force him out of office.  Li refused to resign, so Xue
ordered his men to cut off the water and electricity to the
presidential palace.  After a few days, conditions inside the building
became unbearable, and on the night of 13 June President Li abandoned
his malodorous residence and fled the capital for the port city of

Tianjin, seventy miles to the southeast.

In China the authority of an office lay not only in its holder but in
the official seals.  No document was valid, even if it had the
president's signature on it, unless it carried his seal.  Knowing that
no one could take over the presidency without them, President Li left
the seals with one of his concubines, who was convalescing in a
hospital in Peking run by French missionaries.

As President Li was nearing Tianjin his train was stopped by armed
police, who told him to hand over the seals.  At first he refused to
say where he had hidden them, but after several hours he relented.  At
three in the morning

General Xue went to the French hospital to collect the seals from the
concubine.  When he appeared by her bedside, the concubine at first
refused even to look at him:

"How can I hand over the president's seals to a mere policeman?"  she
said haughtily.  But General Xue, resplendent in his full uniform,
looked so intimidating that she soon meekly placed the seals in his
hands.

Over the next four months, Xue used his police to make sure that the
man his faction wanted to see as president, Tsao Kun, would win what
was billed as one of China's first elections.  The 804 members of
parliament had to be bribed.  Xue and General Feng stationed guards on
the parliament building and let it be known that there would be a
handsome consideration for anyone who voted the right way, which
brought many deputies scurrying back from the provinces.  By the time
everything was ready for the election there were 555 members of
parliament in Peking.  Four days before the election, after much
bargaining, they were each given 5,000 silver yuan, a rather
substantial sum.  On 5 October 1923, Tsao Kun was elected president of
China with 480 votes.  Xue was rewarded with promotion to full general.
Also promoted were seventeen 'special advisers' all favorite mistresses
or concubines of various warlords and generals.  This episode has
entered Chinese history as a notorious example of how an election can
be manipulated.  People still cite it to argue that democracy will not
work in China.

In early summer the following year General Xue visited Yixian.  Though
it was not a large town, it was strategically important.  It was about
here that the writ of the Peking government began to run out.  Beyond,
power was in the hands of the great warlord of the northeast, Chang
Tso-lin, known as the Old Marshal.  Officially, General Xue was on an
inspection trip, but he also had some personal interests in the area.
In Yixian he owned the main grain stores and the biggest shops,
including a pawnshop which doubled as the bank and issued its own
money, which circulated in the town and the surrounding area.

36 "Three-Inch Golden Lilies'

For my great-grandfather, this was a once-in-a-lifetime chance, the
closest he was ever going to get to a real V.I.P.

He schemed to get himself the job of escorting General Xue, and told
his wife he was going to try to marry their daughter off to him.  He
did not ask his wife for her agreement; he merely informed her.  Quite
apart from this being the custom of the day, my great-grandfather
despised his wife.  She wept, but said nothing.  He told her she must
not breathe a word to their daughter.  There was no question of
consulting his daughter.  Marriage was a transaction, not a matter of
feelings.  She would be informed when the wedding was arranged.

My great-grandfather knew that his approach to General

Xue had to be indirect.  An explicit offer of his daughter's hand would
lower her price, and there was also the possibility that he might be
turned down.  General Xue had to have a chance to see what he was being
offered.  In those days respectable women could not be introduced to
strange men, so Yang had to create an opportunity for General Xue to
see his daughter.  The encounter had to seem accidental.

In Yixian there was a magnificent 9o0-year-old Buddhist temple made of
precious wood and standing about a hundred feet high.  It was set
within an elegant precinct, with rows of cypress trees, which covered
an area of almost a square mile.  Inside was a brightly painted wooden
statue of the Buddha, thirty feet high, and the interior of the temple
was covered with delicate murals depicting his life.

It was an obvious place for Yang to take the visiting V.I.P.

And temples were among the few places women of good families could go
on their own.

My grandmother was told to go to the temple on a certain day.  To show
her reverence for the Buddha, she took perfumed baths and spent long
hours meditating in front of burning incense at a little shrine.  To
pray in the temple she was supposed to be in a state of maximum
tranquillity, and to be free of all unsettling emotions.  She set off
in a , rented horse-drawn carriage, accompanied by a maid.  She wore a
duck-egg-blue jacket, its edges embroidered in gold thread to show off
its simple lines, with butterfly buttons up the right-hand side.  With
this she wore a pleated pink skirt, embroidered all over with tiny
flowers.  Her long black hair was woven into a single plait.  Peeping
out at the top was a silk black-green peony, the rarest kind.  She wore
no makeup, but was richly scented, as was considered appropriate for a
visit to a temple.  Once inside, she knelt before the giant statue of
the Buddha.  She kowtowed several times to the wooden image and then
remained kneeling before it, her hands clasped in prayer.

As she was praying, her father arrived with General Xue.

The two men watched from the dark aisle.  My great grandfather had
planned well.  The position in which my grandmother was kneeling
revealed not only her silk trousers, which were edged in gold like her
jacket, but also her tiny feet in their embroidered satin shoes.

When she finished praying, my grandmother kowtowed three times to the
Buddha.  As she stood up she slightly lost her balance, which was easy
to do with bound feet.

She reached out to steady herself on her maid's arm.  General Xue and
her father had just begun to move forward.

She blushed and bent her head, then turned and started to walk away,
which was the right thing to do.  Her father stepped forward and
introduced her to the general.  She curtsied, keeping her head lowered
all the time.

As was fitting for a man in his position, the general did not say much
about the meeting to Yang, who was a rather lowly subordinate, but my
great-grandfather could see he was fascinated.  The next step was to
engineer a more direct encounter.  A couple of days later Yang risking
bankruptcy, rented the best theater in town and put on a local opera,
inviting General Xue as the guest of honor.  Like most Chinese
theaters, it was built around a rectangular space open to the sky, with
timber structures on three sides; the fourth side formed the stage,
which was completely bare:

it had no curtain and no sets.  The seating area was more

like a cafe than a theater in the West. The men sat at tables in the
open square, eating, drinking, and talking loudly throughout the
performance.  To the side, higher up, was the dress circle, where the
ladies sat more demurely at smaller tables, with their maids standing
behind them.  My great-grandfather had arranged things so that his
daughter was in a place where General Xue could see her easily.

This time she was much more dressed up than in the temple.  She wore a
heavily embroidered satin dress and jewelry in her hair.  She was also
displaying her natural vivacity and energy, laughing and chatting with
her women friends.  General Xue hardly looked at the stage.

After the show there was a traditional Chinese game called
lantern-riddles.  This took place in two separate halls, one for the
men and one for the women.  In each room were dozens of elaborate paper
lanterns, stuck on which were a number of riddles in verse.  The person
who guessed the most answers won a prize.  Among the men General Xue
was the winner, naturally.  Among the women, it was my grandmother.

Yang had now given General Xue a chance to appreciate his daughter's
beauty and her intelligence.  The final qualification was artistic
talent.  Two nights later he invited the general to his house for
dinner.  It was a clear, warm night, with a full moon a classic setting
for listening to the qin.  After dinner, the men sat on the veranda and
my grandmother was summoned to play in the courtyard.  Sitting under a
trellis, with the scent of syringa in the air, her performance
enchanted General Xue.  Later he was to tell her that her playing that
evening in the moonlight had captured his heart.  When my mother was
born, he gave her the name Bao (~I'm, which means "Precious Zither."

Before the evening was over he had proposed not to my grandmother, of
course, but to her father.  He did not offer marriage, only that my
grandmother should become his concubine.  But Yang had not expected
anything else.

*#06#
The Xue family would have arranged a marriage for the general long
before on the basis of social positions.  In any case, the Yangs were
too humble to provide a wife.  But it was expected that a man like
General Xue should take concubines.  Wives were not for pleasure that
was what concubines were for.  Concubines might acquire considerable
power, but their social status was quite different from that of a wife.
A concubine was a kind of institutionalized mistress, acquired and
discarded at will.

The first my grandmother knew of her impending liaison was when her
mother broke the news to her a few days before the event.  My
grandmother bent her head and wept.

She hated the idea of being a concubine, but her father had already
made the decision, and it was unthinkable to oppose one's parents.  To
question a parental decision was considered unfilial and to be un
filial was tantamount to treason.  Even if she refused to consent to
her father's wishes, she would not be taken seriously; her action would
be interpreted as indicating that she wanted to stay with her parents.
The only way to say no and be taken seriously was to commit suicide. My
grandmother bit her lip and said nothing.  In fact, there was nothing
she could say.  Even to say yes would be considered unladylike, as it
would be taken to imply that she was eager to leave her parents.

Seeing how unhappy she was, her mother started telling her that this
was the best match possible.  Her husband had told her about General
Xue's power: "In Peking they say, "When General Xue stamps his foot,
the whole city shakes."  In fact, my grandmother had been rather taken
with the general's handsome, martial demeanor.  And she had been
flattered by all the admiring words he had said about her to her
father, which were now elaborated and embroidered upon.  None of the
men in Yixian were as impressive as the warlord general.  At fifteen,
she had no idea what being a concubine really meant, and thought she
could win General Xue's love and lead a happy life.

General Xue had said that she could stay in Yixian, in a house which he
was going to buy especially for her.  This

40 "Three-Inch Golden Lilies' 
meant she could be close to her own
family, but, even more important, she would not have to live in his
residence, where she would have to submit to the authority of his wife
and the other concubines, who would all have precedence over her.  In
the house of a potentate like General Xue, the women were virtual
prisoners, living in a state of permanent squabbling and bickering,
largely induced by insecurity.  The only security they had was their
husband's favor.

General Xue's offer of a house of her own meant a lot to my
grandmother, as did his promise to solemnize the liaison with a full
wedding ceremony.  This meant that she and her family would have gained
a considerable amount of face.  And there was one final consideration
which was very important to her: now that her father was satisfied, she
hoped he would treat her mother better.

Mrs. Yang suffered from epilepsy, which made her feel undeserving
towards her husband.  She was always submissive to him, and he treated
her like dirt, showing no concern for her health.  For years, he found
fault with her for not producing a son.  My great-grandmother had a
string of miscarriages after my grandmother was born, un61 a second
child came along in 1917 but again, it was a girl.

My great-grandfather was obsessed with having enough money to be able
to acquire concubines.  The 'wedding' allowed him to fulfill this wish,
as General Xue lavished betrothal gifts on the family, and the chief
beneficiary was my great-grandfather.  The gifts were magnificent, in
keeping with the general's station.

On the day of the wedding, a sedan chair draped with heavy, bright-red
embroidered silk and satin appeared at the Yangs' house.  In front came
a procession carrying banners, plaques, and silk lanterns painted with
images of a golden phoenix, the grandest s3nnbol for a woman.  The
wedding ceremony took place in the evening, as was the tradition, with
red lanterns glowing in the dusk.  There was an orchestra with drums,
cymbals, and piercing wind

Concubine to a Warlord Genera/ 4 I instruments playing joyful music.
Making a lot of noise was considered essential for a good wedding, as
keeping quiet would have been seen as suggesting that there was
something shameful about the event.  My grandmother was splendidly
dressed in bright embroidery, with a red silk veil coveting her head
and face.  She was carried in the sedan chair to her new home by eight
men.  Inside the sedan chair it was stuffy and boiling hot, and she
discreetly pulled the curtain back a few inches.  Peeping out from
under her veil, she was delighted to see people in the streets watching
her procession.  This was very different from what a mere concubine
would get a small sedan chair draped in plain cotton of the unglamorous
color of indigo, borne by two or at the most four people, and no
procession or music.  She was taken right around the town, visiting all
four gates, as a full ritual demanded, with her expensive wedding gifts
displayed on cans and in large wicker baskets carried behind her. After
she had been shown off to the town, she reached her new home, a large,
stylish residence.  My grandmother was satisfied.  The pomp and
ceremony made her feel she had gained prestige and esteem.  There had
been nothing like this in Yixian in living memory.

When she reached the house General Xue, in full military dress, was
waiting, surrounded by the local dignitaries.

Red candles and dazzling gas lamps lit up the center of the house, the
sitting room, where they performed a ceremonial kowtow to the tablets
of Heaven and Earth.  After this, they kowtowed to each other, then my
grandmother went into the wedding chamber alone, in accordance with the
custom, while General Xue went off to a lavish banquet with the men.

General Xue did not leave the house for three days.  My grandmother was
happy.  She thought she loved him, and he showed her a kind of gruff
affection.  But he hardly spoke to her about serious matters, in
keeping with the traditional saying: "Women have long hair and short
intellio

42 "Three-Inch Golden Lilies' gence."  A Chinese man was supposed to
remain reticent and grand, even within his family.  So she kept quiet,
just massaging his toes before they got up in the morning and playing
the qin to him in the evening.  After a week, he suddenly told her he
was leaving.  He did not say where he was going and she knew it was not
a good idea to ask.

Her duty was to wait for him until he came back.  She had to wait six
years.

In September 1924, fighting erupted between the two main warlord
factions in North China.  General Xue was promoted to deputy commander
of the Peking garrison, but within weeks his old ally General Feng, the
Christian warlord, changed sides.  On 3 November, Tsao Kun, whom

General Xue and General Feng had helped install as president the
previous year, was forced to resign.  The same day the Peking garrison
was dismissed, and two days later the

Peking police office was disbanded.  General Xue had to leave the
capital in a hurry.  He retired to a house he owned in Tianjin, in the
French concession, which had extraterritorial immunity.  This was the
very place to which President

Li had fled the year before when Xue had forced him out of the
presidential palace.

In the meantime my grandmother was caught up in the renewed fighting.
Control of the northeast was vital in the struggle between the warlord
armies, and towns on the railway, especially junctions like Yixian,
were particular targets.  Shortly after General Xue left, the fighfng
came right up to the walls of the town, with pitched battles just
outside the gates.  Loofng was widespread.  One Italian arms company
appealed to the cash-strapped warlords by advertising that it would
accept loo table villages' as collateral.  Rape was just as
commonplace.  Like many other women, my grandmother had to blacken her
face with soot to make herself look filthy and ugly.  Fortunately, this
time

Yixian emerged virtually unscathed.  The fighfng eventually moved south
and life returned to normal.

For my grandmother, 'normal' meant finding ways to kill time in her
large house.  The house was built in the typical North Chinese style,
around three sides of a quadrangle, the south side of the courtyard
being a wall about seven feet high, with a moon gate which opened onto
an outer courtyard, which in turn was guarded by a double gate with a
round brass knocker.

These houses were built to cope with the extremes of a brutally harsh
climate, which lurched from freezing winters to scorching summers, with
virtually no spring or autumn in between.  In summer, the temperature
could rise above 95 F, but in winter it fell to minus 2o F, with
howling winds which roared down from Siberia across the plains.

Dust tore into the eyes and bit into the skin for much of the year, and
people often had to wear masks which covered their entire faces and
heads.  In the inner courtyard of the houses, all the windows in the
main rooms opened to the south to let in as much sunshine as possible,
while the walls on the north side took the brunt of the wind and the
dust.  The north side of the house contained a sitting room and my
grandmother's chamber; the wings on the two sides were for the servants
and for all other activities.
*#06#
The floors of the main rooms were tiled, while the wooden windows were
covered with paper.  The pitched roof was made of smooth black files.

The house was luxurious by local standards and far superior to her
parents' home but my grandmother was lonely and miserable.  There were
several servants, including a doorkeeper, a cook, and two maids.  Their
task was not only to serve, but also to act as guards and spies.  The
doorkeeper was under instructions not to let my grandmother out alone
under any circumstances.  Before he left, General Xue told my
grandmother a cautionary tale about one of his other concubines.  He
had found out that she had been having an affair with a male servant,
so he had her tied to a bed and stuffed a gag into her mouth.  Then raw
alcohol was dripped onto the cloth, slowly choking her to death.

"Of course, I could not give her the pleasure of

44 "Three-Inch Golden Lilies' dying speedily.  For a woman to betray
her husband is the vilest thing possible," he said.  Where infidelity
was involved, a man like General Xue would hate the woman far more than
the man.

"All I did with the lover was have him shot," he added casually.  My
grandmother never knew whether or not all this had really happened, but
at the age of fifteen she was suitably petrified.

From that moment she lived in constant fear.  Because she could hardly
ever go out, she had to create a world for herself within the four
walls.  But even there she was not the real mistress of her home, and
she had to spend a great deal of time buttering up the servants in case
they invented stories against her which was so common it was considered
almost inevitable.  She gave them plenty of presents, and also
organized mahjongg parties, because the winners would always have to
tip the servants generously.

She was never short of money.  General Xue sent her a regular
allowance, which was delivered every month by the manager of his
pawnshop, who also picked up the bills for her losses at the mahjongg
parties.

Throwing mahjongg parties was a normal part of life for concubines all
over China.  So was smoking opium, which was widely available and was
seen as a means of keeping people like her contented by being doped and
dependent.  Many concubines became addicted in their attempts to ape
with their loneliness.  General Xue encouraged my grandmother to take
up the habit, but she ignored him.

Almost the only time she was allowed out of the house was to go to the
opera.  Otherwise, she had to sit at home all day, every day.  She read
a lot, mainly plays and novels, and tended her favorite flowers, garden
balsam, hibiscus, common four-o'clock, and roses of Sharon in pots in
the courtyard, where she also cultivated dwarf trees.  Her other
consolation in her gilded cage was a cat.

She was allowed to visit her parents, but even this was frowned upon,
and she was not permitted to stay the night with them.  Although they
were the only people she could talk to, she found visiting them a
trial.  Her father had been promoted to deputy chief of the local
police because of his connection to General Xue, and had acquired land
and property.  Every time she opened her mouth about how miserable she
was, her father would start lecturing her, telling her that a virtuous
woman should suppress her emotions and not desire anything beyond her
duty to her husband.  It was all right to miss her husband, that was
virtuous, but a woman was not supposed to complain.  In fact, a good
woman was not supposed to have a point of view at all, and if she did,
she certainly should not be so brazen as to talk about it.  He would
quote the Chinese saying, "If you are married to a chicken, obey the
chicken; if you are married to a dog, obey the dog."

Six years passed.  To begin with, there were a few letters, then total
silence.  Unable to burn off her nervous energy and sexual frustration,
unable even to pace the floor with a full stride because of her bound
feet, my grandmother was reduced to mincing around the house.  At
first, she hoped for some message, going over and over again in her
mind her brief life with the general.  Even her physical and
psychological submission was mulled over nostalgically.

She missed him very much, though she knew that she was only one of his
many concubines, probably dotted around China, and she had never
imagined that she would spend the rest of her life with him.  Still she
longed for him, as he represented her only chance to live a sort of
life.

But as the weeks turned into months, and the months into years, her
longing became dulled.  She came to realize that for him she was a mere
plaything, to be picked up again only when it was convenient for him.
Her restlessness now had no object on which to focus.  It became forced
into a straitjacket.  When occasionally it stretched its limbs she felt
so agitated she did not know what to do with herself.  Sometimes, she
would fall to the floor un con 46 "Three-Inch Golden Lilies' sc ious
She was to have blackouts like these for the rest of her life.

Then one day, six years after he had walked casually out of the door,
her 'husband' reappeared.  The meeting was very unlike what she had
dreamed of at the beginning of their separation.  Then she had
fantasized that she would give herself totally and passionately to him,
but now all she could find in herself was restrained dutifulness.  She
was also racked with anxiety in case she might have offended one of the
servants, or that they might invent stories to ingratiate themselves
with the general and ruin her life.

But everything went smoothly.  The general, now past fifty, seemed m
have mellowed, and did not look nearly as majestic as before.  As she
expected, he did not say a word about where he had been, why he had
left so suddenly, or why he was back, and she did not ask.  Quite apart
from not wanting to be scolded for being inquisitive, she did not
care.

In fact, all this time the general had not been far away at all.  He
had been leading the quiet life of a wealthy retired dignitary,
dividing his time between his house in Tianjin and his country mansion
near Lulong.  The world in which he had flourished was becoming a thing
of the past.  The warlord and their fief system had collapsed and most
of China was now controlled by a force, the Kuomintang, or
Nationalists, headed by Chiang Kai-shek.

To mark the break with the chaotic past, and to try to give the
appearance of a new start and of stability, the Kuomintang moved the
capital from Peking ("Northern Capital') to Nanjing ("Southern
Capital').  In 19z8, the ruler of Manchuria, Chang Tso-lin, the Old
Marshal, was assassinated by the Japanese, who were becoming
increasingly active in the area.  The Old Marshal's son, Chang
Hsueh-liang (known as the Young Marshal), joined up with the Kuomintang
and formally integrated Manchuria with the rest of China- though
Kuomintang rule was never effectively established in Manchuria.

General Xue's visit to my grandmother did not last long.

Just like the first time, after a few days he suddenly announced he was
leaving.  The night before he was due to leave, he asked my grandmother
to go and live with him at Lulong.  Her heart missed a beat.  If he
ordered her to go, it would amount to a life sentence under the same
roof as his wife and his other concubines.  She was invaded by a wave
of panic.  As she massaged his feet, she quietly pleaded with him to
let her stay in Yixian.  She told him how kind he was to have promised
her parents he would not take her away from them, and gently reminded
him that her mother was not in good health: she had just had a third
child, the longed-for son.  She said that she would like to observe
filial piety, while, of course, serving him, her husband and master,
whenever he graced Yixian with his presence.  The next day she packed
his things and he left, alone.  On his departure, as on his arrival, he
showered jewels on my grandmother gold, silver, jade, pearls, and
emeralds.  Like many men of his kind, he believed this was the way to a
woman's heart.  For women like my grandmother, jewelry was their only
insurance.

A short time later, my grandmother realized she was pregnant.  On the
seventeenth day of the third moon, in spring 193i, she gave birth to a
baby girl my mother.

She wrote to General Xue to let him know, and he wrote back telling her
to call the gift Bao Q~m and to bring her to Lulong as soon as they
were strong enough to travel.

My grandmother was ecstatic at having a child.  Now, she felt, her life
had a purpose, and she poured all her love and energy into my mother. A
happy year passed.  General Xue wrote many times asking her to come to
Lulong, but each time she managed to stall him.  Then, one day in the
middle of summer 1932, a telegram arrived saying that General Xue was
seriously ill and ordering her to bring their daughter to see him at
once.  The tone made it clear that this time she should not refuse.

Lulong was about 200 miles away, and for my grandmother, who had never
traveled, the journey was a major undertaking.  It was also extremely
difficult to travel with bound feet; it was almost impossible to carry
luggage, especially with a young child in one's arms.  My grandmother
decided to take her fourteen-year-old sister, Yulan, whom she called
"Lan," with her.

The journey was an adventure.  The area had been convulsed yet again.
In September 193I Japan, which had been steadily expanding its power in
the area, had launched a full-scale invasion of Manchuria, and Japanese
troops had occupied Yixian on 6 January 1932.  Two months later the
Japanese proclaimed the founding of a new state, which they named
Manchukuo ("Manchu

Country'), covering most of northeast China (an area the size of France
and Germany combined).  The Japanese claimed that Manchukuo was
independent, but in fact it was a puppet of Tokyo.  As its head they
installed Pu

Yi, who as a child had been the last emperor of China.

At first he was called Chief Executive; later, in 1934, he was made
emperor of Manchukuo.  All this meant little to my grandmother, who had
had very little contact with the outside world.  The general population
were fatalistic about who their rulers were, since they had no choice
in the matter.  For many, Pu Yi was the natural ruler, a Manchu emperor
and proper Son of Heaven.

Twenty years after the republican revolution there was still no unified
nation to replace the rule of the emperor, nor, in Manchuria, did the
people have much concept of being citizens of something called
"China."

One hot summer's day in 1932 my grandmother, her sister, and my mother
took the train south from Yixian, passing out of Manchuria at the town
of Shanhaiguan, where the Great Wall sweeps down from the mountains to
the sea.  As the train chugged along the coastal plain, they could see
the landscape changing: instead of the bare,

brown-yellow soil of the plains of Manchuria, here the earth was darker
and the vegetation denser, almost lush compared with the northeast.
Soon after it passed the Great Wall, the train turned inland, and about
an hour later it stopped at a town called Changli where they
disembarked at a green-roofed building which looked like a railway
station in Siberia.

My grandmother hired a horse-drawn cart and drove north along a bumpy,
dusty road to General Xue's mansion, which lay about twenty miles away,
just outside the wall of a small town called Yanheying, which had once
been a major military camp frequently visited by the Manchu emperors
and their court.  Hence the road had acquired the grand name of 'the
Imperial Way."  It was lined with poplars, their light-green leaves
shimmering in the sunlight.  Beyond them were orchards of peach trees,
which flourished in the sandy soil.  But my grandmother scarcely
enjoyed the scenery, as she was covered in dust and jolted badly by the
rough road.  Above all, she was worrying about what would greet her at
the other end.

When she first saw the mansion, she was overwhelmed by its grandeur.
The immense front gate was guarded by armed men, who stood stiffly at
attention beside enormous statues of reclining lions.  There was a row
of eight stone statues for tying up horses: four were of elephants, and
four of monkeys.  These two animals were chosen for their lucky sounds:
in Chinese the words 'elephant' and 'high office' have the same sound
(xiang), as do 'monkey' and 'aristocracy' (hou).

As the cart passed through the outer gate into an inner yard my
grandmother could see only a huge blank wall facing her; then, off to
one side, she saw a second gate.

This was a classic Chinese structure, a concealing wall so that
strangers could not see into one's property, also making it impossible
for assailants to shoot or charge directly through the front gate.

The moment they passed through the inner gate, a

50 "Three-Inch Golden Lilies' servant materialized at my grandmother's
side and peremptorily took her child away.  Another servant led my
grandmother up the steps of the house and showed her into the sitting
room of General Xue's wife.

As soon as she entered the room, my grandmother went down on her knees
and kowtowed, saying, "I greet you, my mistress," as etiquette
demanded.  My grandmother's sister was not allowed into the room, but
had to stand outside like a servant.  This was nothing personal: the
relatives of a concubine were not treated as part of the family.  After
my grandmother had kowtowed for a suitable length of time, the
general's wife told her she could get up, using a form of address which
immediately established my grandmother's place in the hierarchy of the
household as a mere sub mistress closer to a higher form of servant
than to a wife.

The general's wife told her to sit down.  My grandmother had to make a
split-second decision.  In a traditional Chinese household, where one
sits automatically reflects one's status.  General Xue's wife was
sitting at the north end of the room, as befitted a person in her
position.  Next to her, separated by a side table, was another chair,
also facing south: this was the general's seat.  Down each side of the
room was a row of chairs for people of different status.  My
grandmother shuffled backwards and sat on one of the chairs nearest the
door, to show humility.  The wife then asked her to come forward just a
little.  She had to show some generosity.

When my grandmother was seated, the wife told her that from now on her
daughter would be brought up as her (the wife's) own daughter and would
call her, not my grandmother, "Mama'; my grandmother was to treat the
child as the young mistress of the house, and was to behave
accordingly.

A maid was summoned to lead my grandmother away.

She felt her heart was breaking, but she forced back her sobs, only
letting herself go when she reached her room.  Her eyes were still red
when she was taken to meet General

Concubine to a Warlord General 5 I Xue's number-two concubine, his
favorite, who ran the household.  She was pretty, with a delicate face,
and to my grandmother's surprise she was quite sympathetic, but my
grandmother restrained herself from having a good cry with her.  In
this strange new environment, she felt intuitively that the best policy
was caution.

Later that day she was taken to see her 'husband."  She was allowed to
take my mother with her.  The general was lying on a kang, the type of
bed used all over North China, a large, flat, rectangular surface about
two and a half feet high heated from underneath by a brick stove.  A
pair of concubines or maids were kneeling round the prostrate general,
massaging his legs and stomach.  General Xue's eyes were closed, and he
looked terribly sallow.  My grandmother leaned over the edge of the
bed, calling to him softly.  He opened his eyes and managed a kind of a
half smile  My grandmother put my mother on the bed and said: "This is
Bao Odin."  With what seemed a great effort, General Xue feebly stroked
my mother's head and said, "Bao Odin takes after you; she is very
pretty."  Then he closed his eyes.

My grandmother called out to him, but his eyes remained shut.  She
could see that he was gravely ill, perhaps dying.  She picked my mother
off the bed and hugged her tight.  But she had only a second to cuddle
her before the general's wife, who had been hovering alongside, tugged
impatiently at her sleeve.  Once outside, the wife warned my
grandmother not to disturb the master too often, or indeed at all.  In
fact, she should stay in her room unless she was summoned.

My grandmother was terrified.  As a concubine, her whole future and
that of her daughter were in jeopardy, possibly even in mortal peril.
She had no rights.  If the general died, she would be at the mercy of
the wife, who had the power of life and death over her.  She could do
anything she wanted sell her to a rich man, or even into a brothel,
which was quite common.  Then my grandmother

52 "Three-Inch Golden Lilies' would never see her daughter again.  She
knew she and her daughter had to get away as fast as possible.

When she got back to her room, she made a tremendous effort to calm
herself and begin planning her escape.  But when she tried to think,
she felt as though her head were flooding with blood.  Her legs were so
weak she could not walk without holding on to the furniture.  She broke
down and wept again par fly with rage, because she could see no way
out. Worst of all was the thought that the general might die at any
moment, leaving her trapped forever.

Gradually she managed to bring her nerves under control and force
herself to think clearly.  She started to look around the mansion
systematically.  It was divided into many different courtyards, set
within a large compound, surrounded by high walls.  Even the garden was
designed with security rather than aesthetics in mind.  There were a
few cypress trees, some birches and winter plums, but none near the
walls.  To make doubly sure that any potential assassin would have no
cover, there were not even any large shrubs.  The two gates leading out
from the garden were padlocked, and the front gate was guarded around
the clock by armed retainers.

My grandmother was never allowed to leave the walled precincts.  She
was permitted to visit the general each day, but only on a sort of
organized tour with some of the other women, when she would file past
his bed and murmur, "I greet you, my lord."

Meanwhile, she began to get a clearer idea of the other personalities
in the household.  Apart from the general's wife, the woman who seemed
to count most was the number-two concubine.  My grandmother discovered
that she had instructed the servants to treat her well, which made her
situation much easier.  In a household like this, the attitude of the
servants was determined by the status of those they had to serve.  They
fawned on those in favor, and bullied those who had fallen from
grace.

The number-two concubine had a daughter a lime older than my mother.
This was a further bond between the two women, as well as being a
reason for the concubine's favor with General Xue, who had no other
children apart from my mother.

After a month, during which the two concubines became quite friendly,
my grandmother went to see the general's wife and told her she needed
to go home to fetch some clothes.  The wife gave permission, but when
my grandmother asked if she could take her daughter to say goodbye to
her grandparents, she refused.  The Xue bloodline could not be taken
out of the house.

And so my grandmother set off alone down the dusty road to Changli.
After the coachman had dropped her off at the railway station, she
started asking around among the people hanging about there.  She found
two horsemen who were prepared to provide her with the transportation
she needed.  She waited for nightfall, and then raced back to Lulong
with them and their two horses by a shortcut.  One of the men seated
her on a saddle and ran in front, holding the horse by the rein.

When she reached the mansion, she made her way to a back gate and gave
a prearranged signal.  After a wait that felt like hours but was in
fact only a few minutes, the door in the gate swung open and her sister
emerged in the moonlight, holding my mother in her arms.  The door had
been unlocked by the friendly number-two concubine, who had then hit it
with an axe to make it look as though it had been forced open.

There was hardly time for my grandmother to give my mother a quick hug
besides, she did not want to wake her, in case she made a noise and
alerted the guards.  She and her sister mounted the two horses while my
mother was fled onto the back of one of the horsemen, and they headed
off into the night.  The horsemen had been paid well, and ran fast.  By
dawn they were at Changli, and before the alarm could be given, they
had caught the train

54 "Three-Inch Golden Lilies' north.  When the train finally drew into
Yixian toward nightfall, my grandmother fell to the ground and lay
there for a long time, unable to move.

She was comparatively safe, 200 miles from Lulong and effectively out
of reach of the Xue household.  She could not take my mother to her
house, for fear of the servants, so she asked an old schoolfriend if
she could hide my mother.  The friend lived in the house of her
father-in-law, a Manchu doctor called Dr.  Xia, who was well known as a
kindly man who would never turn anyone away or betray a friend.

The Xue household would not care enough about my grandmother, a mere
concubine, to pursue her.  It was my mother, the blood descendant, who
mattered.  My grandmother sent a telegram to Lulong saying my mother
had fallen ill on the train and had died.  There followed an agonizing
wait, during which my grandmother's moods oscillated wildly.  Sometimes
she felt that the family must have believed her story.  But then she
would torment herself with the thought that this might not be the case,
and that they were sending thugs to drag her, or her daughter, back.
Finally she consoled herself with the thought that the Xue family was
far too preoccupied with the impending death of the patriarch to expend
energy worrying about her, and that it was probably to the women's
advantage not to have her daughter around.

Once she realized the Xue family was going to leave her alone, my
grandmother settled back quietly into her house in Yixian with my
mother.  She did not even worry about the servants, since she knew that
her 'husband' would not be coming.  The silence from Lulong lasted over
a year, until one autumn day in 1933, when a telegram arrived informing
her that General Xue had died, and that she was expected at Lulong
immediately for the funeral.

The general had died in Tianjin in September.  His body was brought
back to Lulong in a lacquered coffin covered with red embroidered silk.
Accompanying him were two other coffins, one similarly lacquered and
draped in the same red silk as his own, the other of plain wood with no
covering.  The first coffin contained the body of one of his
concubines, who had swallowed opium to accompany him in death.  This
was considered the height of conjugal loyalty.  Later a plaque
inscribed by the famous warlord Wu Pei-fu was put up in her honor in
General Xue's mansion.  The second coffin contained the remains of
another concubine, who had died of typhoid two years before.  Her
corpse had been exhumed for reburial alongside General Xue, as was the
custom.  Her coffin was of bare wood because, having died of a horrible
illness, she was considered ill fortune.  Mercury and charcoal had been
placed inside each of the coffins to prevent the corpses rotting, and
the bodies had pearls in their mouths.

General Xue and the two concubines were buried together in the same
tomb; his wife and the other concubines would eventually be interred
alongside them.  At a funeral, the essential duty of holding a special
flag for calling the spirit of the deceased had to be performed by the
dead man's son.  As the general had no son, his wife adopted his
ten-year-old nephew so he could carry out the task.  The boy also
enacted another ritual kneeling by the side of the coffin and calling
out "Avoid the nails!"  Tradition held that if this was not done, the
dead person would be hurt by the nails.

The tomb site had been chosen by General Xue himself according to the
principles of geomancy  It was in a beautiful, tranquil spot, backing
onto distant mountains to the north, while the front faced a stream set
among eucalyptus trees to the south.  This location expressed the
desire to have solid things behind on which to lean mountains and the
reflection of the glorious sun, symbolizing rising prosperity, in
front.

But my grandmother never saw the site: she had ignored her summons, and
was not at the funeral.  The next thing that happened was that the
manager of the pawnshop failed

56 "Three-Inch Golden Lilies' to turn up with her allowance.  About a
week later, her parents received a letter from General Xue's wife.  My
grandfather's last words had been to give my grandmother her freedom.
This, for its time, was exceptionally enlightened, and she could hardly
believe her good fortune.

At the age of twenty-four, she was free.

My Grandmother Marries a

Manchu Doctor (lg$$-1938)

The letter from General Xue's wife also asked my grandmother's parents
to take her back.  Though the point was couched in the traditional
indirect manner, my grandmother knew that she was being ordered to move
OUt.

Her father took her in, but with considerable reluctance.

By now he had abandoned any pretense of being a family man.  From the
moment he had arranged the liaison with General Xue, he had risen in
the world.  As well as being promoted to deputy chief of the Yixian
police and entering the ranks of the well-connected, he had become
relatively rich, and had bought some land and taken up smoking opium.

No sooner had he been promoted than he acquired a concubine, a
Mongolian woman who was presented to him by his immediate boss.  Giving
a concubine as a present to an up-and-coming colleague was a common
practice, and the local police chief was happy to oblige a protege of
General Xue.  But my great-grandfather soon began casting around for
another concubine; it was good for a man in his position to have as
many as possible they showed a man's status.  He did not have to look
far: the concubine had a sister.

When my grandmother returned to her parents' house, the setup was quite
different from when she had left almost a decade before.  Instead of
just her unhappy, downtrodden mother, there were now three spouses. One
of the concubines had produced a daughter, who was the same age as my
mother.  My grandmother's sister, Lan, was still unmarried at the
advanced age of sixteen, which was a cause of irritation to Yang.

My grandmother had moved from one cauldron of intrigue into another.
Her father was resentful of both her and her mother.  He resented his
wife simply for being there, and he was even more unpleasant to her now
that he had the two concubines, whom he favored over her.  He took his
meals with the concubines, leaving his wife to eat on her own.  My
grandmother he resented for returning to the house when he had
successfully created a new world for himself.

He also regarded her as a jinx (kc), because she had lost her husband.
In those days, a woman whose husband had died was superstitiously held
responsible for his death.

My great-grandfather saw his daughter as bad luck, a threat to his good
fortune, and he wanted her out of the house.

The two concubines egged him on.  Before my grandmother came back, they
had been having things very much their own way.  My great-grandmother
was a gentle, even weak person.  Although she was theoretically the
superior of the concubines, she lived at the mercy of their whims.

In 193o she gave birth to a son, Yu-lin.  This deprived the concubines
of their future security, as on my great grandfather's death all his
property would automatically go to his son.  They would throw tantrums
if Yang showed any affection at all to his son.  From the moment Yu-lin
was born, they stepped up their psychological warfare against my
great-grandmother, freezing her out in her own house.

They only spoke to her to nag and complain, and if they looked at her
it was with cold stony faces.  My great grandmother got no support from
her husband, whose contempt for her was not pacified by the fact that
she had given him the son.  He found new ways to find fault with her.

My grandmother was a stronger character than her mother, and the misery
of the past decade had toughened her up.  Even her father was a little
in awe of her.  She told herself that the days of her subservience to
her father were over, and that she was going to fight for herself and
for her mother.  As long as she was in the house, the-concubines had to
restrain themselves, even presenting a toadying smile occasionally.

This was the atmosphere in which my mother lived the formative years
from two to four.  Though shielded by her mother's love, she could
sense the tension which pervaded the household.

My grandmother was now a beautiful young woman in her mid-twenties. She
was also highly accomplished, and several men asked her father for her
hand.  But because she had been a concubine, the only ones who offered
to take her as a proper wife were poor and did not stand a chance with
Mr.  Yang.

My grandmother had had enough of the spitefulness and petty
vengefulness of the concubine world, in which the only choice was
between being a victim and victimizing others.  There was no halfway
house.  All my grandmother wanted was to be left alone to bring up her
daughter in peace.

Her father was constantly badgering her to remarry, sometimes by
dropping unkind hints, at other times telling her outright she had to
take herselfoffhis hands.  But there was nowhere for her to go.  She
had no place to live, and she was not allowed to get a job.  After a
time, unable to stand the pressure, she had a nervous breakdown.

A doctor was called in.  It was Dr.  Xia, in whose house my mother had
been hidden three years before, after the escape from General Xue's
mansion.  Although she had been a friend of his daughter-in-law, Dr.
Xia had never seen my grandmother in keeping with the strict sexual
segregation prevalent at the time.  When he first walked into her room,
he was so struck by her beauty that in his confusion he backed straight
out again and mumbled to the servant that he felt unwell.  Eventually,
he recovered his composure and sat and talked to her at length.  He was
the first man she had ever met to whom she could say what she really
felt, and she poured out her grief and her hopes to him although with
restraint, as be fitted a woman talking to a man who was not her
husband.  The doctor was gentle and warm, and my grandmother had never
felt so understood.  Before long, the two fell in love, and Dr.  Xia
proposed.  Moreover, he told my grandmother that he wanted her to be
his proper wife, and to bring my mother up as his own daughter.  My
grandmother accepted, with tears of joy.  Her father was also happy,
although he was quick to point out to Dr.  Xia that he would not be
able to provide any dowry.  Dr.  Xia told him that was completely
irrelevant.

Dr.  Xia had built up a considerable practice in traditional medicine
in Yixian, and enjoyed a very high professional reputation.  He was not
a Han Chinese, as were the Yangs and most people in China, but a
Manchu, one of the origin aI inhabitants of Manchuria.  At one time his
family had been court doctors for the Manchu emperors, and had been
honored for their services.

Dr.  Xia was well known not only as an excellent doctor, but also as a
very kind man, who often treated poor people for nothing.  He was a big
man, over six feet tall, but he moved elegantly, in spite of his size.
He always dressed in traditional long robes and jacket.  He had gentle
brown eyes, and a goatee and a long drooping mustache.  His face and
his whole posture exuded calm.

My Grandmother Marries a Manchu Doctor 61 The doctor was already an
elderly man when he proposed to my grandmother.  He was sixty-five, and
a widower, with three grown-up sons and one daughter, all of them
married.  The three sons lived in the house with him.

The eldest looked after the household and managed the family farm, the
second worked in his father's practice, and the third, who was married
to my grandmother's schoolfriend, was a teacher.  Between them the sons
had eight children, one of whom was married and had a son himself.

Dr.  Xia called his sons into his study and told them about his plans.
They stole disbelieving, leaden glances at one another.  There was a
heavy silence.  Then the eldest spoke:

"I presume, Father, you mean she will be a concubine."  Dr.  Xia
replied that he was going to take my grandmother as a proper wife. 
This had tremendous implications, as she would become their stepmother,
and would have to be treated as a member of the older generation, with
venerable status on a par with her husband.  In an ordinary Chinese
household the younger generations had to be subservient to the older,
with suitable decorum to mark their relative positions, but Dr.  Xia
adhered to an even more complicated Manchu system of etiquette.  The
younger generations had to pay their respects to the older every
morning and evening, the men kneeling and the women curtsying.  At
festivals, the men had to do a full kowtow.  The fact that my
grandmother had been a concubine, plus the age gap, which meant they
would have to do obeisance to someone with an inferior status and much
younger than themselves, was too much for the sons.

They got together with the rest of the family and worked themselves up
into a state of outrage.  Even the daughterin-law who was my
grandmother's old schoolfriend was upset, as her father-in-law's
marriage would force her into a radically new relationship with someone
who had been her classmate.  She would not be able to eat at the same
table as her old friend, or even sit down with her; she

would have to wait on her hand and foot, and even kowtow to her.

Each member of the family sons, daughters-in-law, grandchildren, even
the great-grandson went in turn to beg Dr.  Xia to 'consider the
feelings' of his 'own flesh and blood."  They went down on their knees,
they prostrated themstelves in a full kowtow, they wept and screamed.

They begged Dr.  Xia to consider the fact that he was a Manchu, and
that according to ancient Manchu custom a man of his status should not
marry a Han Chinese.  Dr.  Xia replied that the rule had been abolished
a long time before.

His children said that if he was a good Manchu, he should observe it
anyway.  They went on and on about the age gap.

Dr.  Xia was more than twice my grandmother's age.  One of the family
trotted out an ancient saying: "A young wife who has an old husband is
really another man's woman."

What hurt Dr.  Xia more was the emotional blackmail especially the
argument that taking an ex-concubine as a proper wife would affect his
children's position in society.

He knew his children would lose face, and he felt guilty about this.
But Dr.  Xia felt he had to put my grandmother's happiness first.  If
he took her as a concubine, she would not merely lose face, she would
become the slave of the whole family.  His love alone would not be
enough to protect her if she was not his proper wife.

Dr.  Xia implored his family to grant an old man's wish.

But they and society took the attitude that an irresponsible wish
should not be indulged.  Some hinted that he was senile.  Others told
him: "You already have sons, grandsons, and even a great-grandson, a
big and prosperous family.  What more do you want?  Why do you have to
marry her?"

The arguments went on and on.  More and more relatives and friends
appeared on the scene, all invited by the sons.  They unanimously
pronounced the marriage to be an insane idea.  Then they turned their
venom against my grandmother.

"Marrying again when her late husband's body and bones are not yet
cold!"

"That woman has it all worked out: she is refusing to accept concubine
status so that she can become a proper wife.  If she really loves you,
why can't she be satisfied with being your concubine?"

They attributed motives to my grandmother: she was scheming to get Dr.
Xia to marry her, and would then take over the family and ill-treat his
children and grandchildren.

They also insinuated that she was plotting to lay her hands on Dr.
Xia's money.  Underneath all their talk about propriety, morality, and
Dr.  Xia's own good, there was an unspoken calculation involving his
assets.  The relatives feared my grandmother might lay her hands on Dr.
Xia's wealth, as she would automatically become the manageress of the
household as his wife.

Dr.  Xia was a rich man.  He owned 2,000 acres of farmland dotted
around the county of Yixian, and even had some land south of the Great
Wall.  His large house in the town was built of gray bricks stylishly
outlined in white paint.  Its ceilings were whitewashed and the rooms
were wallpapered, so that the beams and joints were concealed, which
was considered an important indicator of prosperity.

He also owned a flourishing medical practice and a medicine shop.

When the family saw they were getting nowhere, they decided to work on
my grandmother directly.  One day the daughter-in-law who had been at
school with her paid a call.  After tea and social chitchat, the friend
got around to her mission.  My grandmother burst into tears, and took
her by the hand in their usual intimate manner.  What would she do if
she were in her position, she asked.  When she got no reply, she
pressed on: "You know what being a concubine is like.  You wouldn't
like to be one, would you?

You know, there is an expression of Confucius: "Jiang-xinbi-xin Imagine
my heart was yours"!"  Appealing to someone's better instincts with a
precept from the sage sometimes worked better than a direct no.

The friend went back to her family feeling quite guilty,

and reported her failure.  She hinted that she did not have the heart
to push my grandmother anymore.  She found an ally in De-gui, Dr. Xia's
second son, who practiced medic Me with his father, and was closer to
him than his brothers.  He said he thought they should let the marriage
go ahead.  The third son also began to weaken when he heard his wife
describe my grandmother's distress.

The ones who were most indignant were the eldest son and his wife. When
she saw that the other two sons were wavering, the eldest son's wife
said to her husband: "Of course they don't care.  They've got other
jobs.  That woman can't take those away from them.  But what have you
got?  You are only the manager of the old man's estate and it will all
go to her and her daughter!  What will become of poor me and our poor
children?  We have nothing to fall back on.  Perhaps we should all die!
Perhaps that is what your father really wants!  Perhaps I should kill
myself to make them all happy!"  All this was accompanied by wailing
and floods of tears.  Her husband replied in an agitated manner: "Just
give me fill tomorrow."

When Dr.  Xia woke the next morning he found his entire family, with
the sole exception of De-gui, fifteen people in all, kneeling outside
his bedchamber.  The moment he emerged, his eldest son shouted
"Kowtow!"  and they all prostrated themselves in unison.  Then, in a
voice quaking with emotion, the son declaimed: "Father, your children
and your entire family will stay here and kowtow to you till our deaths
unless you start to think of us, your family and, above all, your
elderly self."

Dr.  Xia was so angry his whole body shook.  He asked his children to
stand up, but before anyone could move the eldest son spoke again: "No,
Father, we won't- not unless you call off the wedding!"  Dr.  Xia tried
to reason with him, but the son continued to hector him in a quivering
voice.  Finally Dr.  Xia said: "I know what is on your minds.  I won't
be in this world much longer.  If you are worried about how your future
stepmother will behave, I

b have not the slightest doubt that she will treat you all very well. 
I know she is a good person. Surely you can see there is no other
reassurance I can give you except her character..."

At the mention of the word 'character," the eldest son gave a loud
snort: "How can you mention the word "character" about a concubine!  No
good woman would have become a concubine in the first place!"  He then
started to abuse my grandmother.  At this, Dr.  Xia could not control
himself.  He lifted his walking stick and began thrashing his son.

All his life Dr.  Xia had been the epitome of restraint and calm.  The
whole family, still on their knees, was stunned.  The great-grandson
started screaming hysterically.  The eldest son was dumbstruck, but
only for a second; then he raised his voice again, not only from
physical hurt, but also for his wounded pride at being beaten in front
of his family.  Dr.  Xia stopped, short of breath from anger and
exertion.  At once the son started bellowing more abuse against my
grandmother.  His father shouted at him to shut up, and struck him so
hard his walking stick broke in two.

The son reflected on his humiliation and pain for a few seconds.  Then
he pulled out a pistol and looked Dr.  Xia in the face.

"A loyal subject uses his death to remonstrate with the emperor.  A
filial son should do the same with his father.  All I have to
remonstrate with you is my death!"  A shot rang out.  The son swayed,
then keeled over onto the floor.  He had fired a bullet into his
abdomen.

A horse-drawn cart rushed him to a nearby hospital, where he died the
next day.  He probably had not intended to kill himself, just to make a
dramatic gesture so the pressure on his father would be irresistible.

His son's death devastated Dr.  Xia.  Although outwardly he appeared
calm as usual, people who knew him could see that his tranquillity had
become scarred with a deep sadness.  From then on he was subject to
bouts of melancholy, very much out of character with his previous
imperturbability.

Yixian was boiling with indignafon, rumor, and accusations.  Dr.  Xia
and particularly my grandmother were made to feel responsible for the
death.  Dr.  Xia wanted to show he was not going to be deterred.  Soon
after the funeral of his son, he fixed a date for the wedding.  He
warned his children that they must pay due respect to their new mother,
and sent out invitations to the leading townspeople.  Custom dictated
that they should attend and give presents.  He also told my grandmother
to prepare for a big ceremony.  She was frightened by the accusations
and their unforeseeable effect on Dr.  Xia, and was desperately trying
to convince herself that she was not guilty.  But, above all, she felt
defiant.  She consented to a full ceremonial ritual.  On the wedding
day she left her father's house in an elaborate carriage accompanied by
a procession of musicians.  As was the Manchu custom, her own family
hired the carriage to take her halfway to her new home, and the
bridegroom sent another to carry her the second half of the way.  At
the han dover point, her five year-old brother, Yu-lin, waited at the
foot of the carriage door with his back bent double, symboli?ing the
idea that he was carrying her on his back to Dr.  Xia's carriage.  He
repeated the action when she arrived at Dr.  Xia's house.  A woman
could not just walk into a man's house; this would imply a severe loss
of status.  She had to be seen to be taken, to denote the requisite
reluctance.

Two bridesmaids led my grandmother into the room where the wedding
ceremony was to take place.  Dr.  Xia was standing before a table
draped with heavy red embroidered silk on which lay the tablets of
Heaven, Earth,

Emperor, Ancestors, and Teacher.  He was wearing a decorated hat like a
crown with a tail-like plumage at the back and a long, loose,
embroidered gown with bell-shaped sleeves, a traditional Manchu
garment, convenient for riding and archery, deriving from the Manchus'
nomadic

past.  He knelt and kowtowed five times to the tablets and then walked
into the wedding chamber alone.

Next my grandmother, still accompanied by her two attendants, curtsied
five times, each time touching her hair with her right hand, in a
gesture resembling a salute.  She could not kowtow because of the mass
of her elaborate headdress.  She then followed Dr.  Xia into the
wedding chamber, where he removed the red cover from her head.

The two bridesmaids presented each of them with an empty gourd-shaped
vase, which they exchanged with each other, and then the bridesmaids
left.  Dr.  Xia and my grandmother sat silently alone together for a
while, and then Dr.  Xia went out to greet the relatives and guests. My
grandmother had to sit, motionless and alone, on the kang, facing the
window on which was a huge red 'double happiness' paper cut, for
several hours.  This was called 'sitting happiness in," symbolizing the
absence of restlessness that was deemed to be an essential quality for
a woman.  After all the guests had gone, a young male relative of Dr.
Xia's came in and tugged her by the sleeve three times.  Only then was
she allowed to get down from the kang.  With the help of her two
attendants, she changed out of her heavily embroidered outfit into a
simple red gown and red trousers.  She removed the enormous headdress
with all the clicking jewels and did her hair in two coils above her
ears.

So in 1935 my mother, now age four, and my grandmother, age twenty-six,
moved into Dr.  Xia's comfortable house.  It was really a compound all
on its own, consisting of the house proper in the interior and the
surgery, with the medicine shop, facing onto the street.  It was
customary for successful doctors to have their own shops.  Here Dr. Xia
sold traditional Chinese medicines, herbs and animal extracts, which
were processed in a workshop by three apprentices.

The facade of the house was surmounted by highly decorated red and gold
eaves.  In the center was a rectangular plaque denoting the Xia
residence in gilded characters.  Behind the shop lay a small courtyard,
with a number of rooms opening off it for the servants and cooks.

Beyond that the compound opened out into several smaller courtyards,
where the family lived.  Farther back was a big garden with cypresses
and winter plums.  There was no grass in the courtyards the climate was
too harsh.  They were just expanses of hard, bare, brown earth, which
turned to dust in the summer and to mud in the brief spring when the
snow melted.  Dr.  Xia loved birds and had a bird garden, and every
morning, whatever the weather, he did qigong, a form of the slow,
graceful Chinse exercises often called tai chi, while he listened to
the birds singing and chirping.

After the death of his son, Dr.  Xia had to endure the constant silent
reproach of his family.  He never talked to my grandmother about the
pain this caused him.  For

Chinese men a stiff upper lip was mandatory.  My grandmother knew what
he was going through, of course, and suffered with him, in silence. She
was very loving toward him, and attended to his needs with all her
heart.

She always showed a smiling face to his family, although they generally
treated her with disdain beneath a veneer of formal respect.  Even the
daughter-in-law who had been at school with her tried to avoid her. The
knowledge that she was held responsible for the eldest son's death
weighed on my grandmother.

Her entire lifestyle had to change to that of a Manchu.

She slept in a room with my mother, and Dr.  Xia slept in a separate
room.  Early every morning, long before she got up, her nerves would
start to strain and jangle, anticipating the noise of the family
members approaching.  She had to wash hurriedly, and greet each of them
in turn with a rigid set of salutations.  In addition, she had to do
her hair in an extremely complicated way so that it could support a
huge headdress, under which she had to wear a wig.  All she got was a
sequence of icy "Good morning's, virtually the only words the family
ever spoke to her.  As she watched them bowing and scraping, she knew
they had hate in their hearts.  The ritual grated all the more for its
insincerity.

On festivals and other important occasions, the whole family had to
kowtow and curtsy to her, and she would have to jump up from her chair
and stand to one side to show that she had left the chair empty, which
symbolized their late mother, to acknowledge their respect.  Manchu
custom conspired to keep her and Dr.  Xia apart.  They were not
supposed even to eat together, and one of the daughters-in-law always
stood behind my grandmother to serve her.  But the woman would present
such a cold face that my grandmother found it difficult to finish her
meal, much less enjoy it.

Once, soon after they had moved into Dr.  Xia's house, my mother had
just settled down into what looked like a nice, comfortable, warm place
on the kang when she saw Dr.  Xia's face suddenly darken, and he
stormed over and roughly pulled her off the seat.  She had sat in his
special place.  This was the only time he ever hit her.  According to
Manchu custom, his seat was sacred.

The move to Dr.  Xia's house brought my grandmother a real measure of
freedom for the first time but also a degree of entrapment.  For my
mother it was no less ambivalent.  Dr.  Xia was extremely kind to her
and brought her x~p as his own daughter.  She called him "Father," and
he gave her his own name, Xia, which she carries to this day and a new
given name, "De-hong," which is made up of two characters: Hong,
meaning 'wild swan," and De, the generation name, meaning 'virtue."

Dr.  Xia's family did not dare insult my grandmother to her face that
would have been tantamount to treason to one's 'mother."  But her
daughter was another matter.  My mother's first memories, apart from
being cuddled by her mother, are of being bullied by the younger
members of Dr.  Xia's family.  She would try not to cry out, and to
hide her bruises and cuts from her mother, but my grandmother knew what
was going on.  She never said anything to Dr.  Xia, as she did not want
to upset him or create more problems for him with his children.  But my
mother was miserable.  She often begged to be taken back to her
grandparents' house, or to the house General Xue had bought, where
everyone had treated her like a princess.  But she soon realized she
should stop asking to 'go home," as this only brought tears to her
mother's eyes.

My mother's closest friends were her pets.  She had an owl, a black
myna bird which could say a few simple phrases, a hawk, a cat, white
mice, and some grasshoppers and crickets which she kept in glass
bottles.  Apart from her mother, her only close human friend was Dr.
Xia's coachman, "Big Old Lee."  He was a tough, leathery-skinned man
from the Hinggan mountains in the far north, where the borders of
China, Mongolia, and the Soviet Union meet.

He had very dark skin, coarse hair, thick lips, and an upturned nose,
all of which are very unusual among Chinese.  In fact, he did not look
Chinese at all.  He was tall, thin, and wiry.  His father had brought
him up as a hunter and trapper, digging out ginseng roots and hunting
bears, foxes, and deer.  For a time they had done very well selling the
skins, but they had eventually been put out of business by bandits, the
worst of whom worked for the Old Marshal, Chang Tso-lin.  Big Old Lee
referred to him as 'that bandit bastard."  Later, when my mother was
told the Old Marshal had been a staunch anti-Japanese patriot, she
remembered Big Old Lee's mockery of the 'hero' of the northeast.

Big Old Lee looked after my mother's pets, and used to take her out on
expeditions with him.  That winter he taught her to skate.  In the
spring, as the snow and ice were melting, they watched people
performing the important annual ritual of 'sweeping the tombs' and
planting flowers on the graves of their ancestors.  In summer they went
fishing and

My Grandmother Marries a Manchu Doctor 71 gathering mushrooms, and in
the autumn they drove out to the edge of town to shoot hares.

In the long Manchurian evenings, when the wind howled across the plains
and the ice froze on the inside of the windows, Big Old Lee would sit
my mother on his knee on the warm kang and tell her fabulous stories
about the mountains of the north.  The images she took to bed were of
mysterious tall trees, exotic flowers, colorful birds singing tuneful
songs, and ginseng roots which were really lit He girls after you dug

run away.

Big Old Lee also told my mother about animal lore.

Tigers, which roamed the mountains of northern Manchuria, were
kind-hearted and would not hurt human beings unless they felt
threatened.  He loved tigers.  But bears were another matter: they were
fierce and one should avoid them at all costs.  If you did happen to
meet one, you must stand still until it lowered its head.  This was
because the bear has a lock of hair on his forehead which falls over
his eyes and blinds him when he drops his head.  With a wolf you should
not turn and run, because you could never outrun it.  You should stand
and face it head-on, looking as though you were not afraid.  Then you
should walk backwards very, very slowly.  Many years later, Big Old
Lee's advice was to save my mother's life.

One day when she was five years old my mother was in the garden talking
to her pets when Dr.  Xia's grandchildren crowded around her in a gang.
They started jostling her and calling her names, and then began to hit
her and shove her around more violently.  They forced her into a corner
of the garden where there was a dried-up well and pushed her in.  The
well was quite deep, and she fell hard on the rubble at the bottom.
Eventually someone heard her screams and called Big Old Lee, who came
running with a ladder; the cook held it steady while he climbed in.  By
now my grandmother had arrived, frantic with worry.  After a few
minutes, Big Old Lee resurfaced carrying my mother, who was half
unconscious and covered with cuts and bruises.  He put her in my
grandmother's arms.  My mother was taken inside, where Dr.  Xia
examined her.

One hipbone was broken.  For years afterward it sometimes became
dislocated and the accident left her with a permanent slight limp..

When Dr.  Xia asked her what had happened, my mother said she had been
pushed by "Number Six [Grandson]."

My grandmother, ever attentive to Dr.  Xia's moods, tried to shush her
up because Number Six was his favorite.

When Dr.  Xia left the room, my grandmother told my mother not to
complain about "Number Six' again, so as not to upset Dr.  Xia.  For
some time my mother was confined to the house because of her hip.  The
other children ostracized her completely.

Immediately after this, Dr.  Xia began to go away for several days at a
time.  He went to the provincial capital,

Jinzhou, about twenty-five miles to the south, looking for a job.  The
atmosphere in the family was unbearable, and my mother's accident,
which might easily have been fatal, convinced him that a move was
essential.

This was no small decision.  In China, to have several generations of a
family living under one roof was considered a great honor.  Streets
even had names like "Five

Generations Under One Roof' to commemorate such families.  Breaking up
the extended family was viewed as a tragedy to be avoided at all costs,
but Dr.  Xia tried to put on a cheerful face to my grandmother, saying
he would be glad to have less responsibility.

My grandmother was vastly relieved, although she tried not to show it.
In fact, she had been gently pushing Dr.  Xia to move, especially after
what happened to my mother.  She had had enough of the extended family,
always glacially present, icily willing her to be miserable, and in
which she had neither privacy nor company.

Dr.  Xia divided his property up among the members of his family.  The
only things he kept for himself were the gifts which had been bestowed
on his ancestors by the Manchu emperors.  To the widow of his eldest
son he gave all his land.  The second son inherited the medicine shop,
and the house was left to his youngest son.  He saw to it that Big Old
Lee and the other servants were well taken care of.  When he asked my
grandmother if she would mind being poor, she said she would be happy
just to have her daughter and himself: "If you have love, even plain
cold water is sweet."

On a freezing December day in 1936 the family gathered outside the
front gate to see them off.  They were all dry eyed except De-gui, the
only son who had backed the marriage.  Big Old Lee drove them in the
horse-drawn carriage to the station, where my mother said a tearful
goodbye to him.  But she became excited when they got on the train.
This was the first time she had been on a train since she was a year
old and she was thrilled, jumping up and down as she looked out the
window.

Jinzhou was a big city, with a population of almost 100,000, the
capital of one of the nine provinces of Manchukuo.  It lies about ten
miles inland from the sea, where Manchuria approaches the Great Wall.
Like Yixian, it was a walled town, but it was growing fast and had
already spread well beyond its walls.  It boasted a number of textile
factories and two oil refineries; it was an important railroad
junction, and even had its own airport.

The Japanese had occupied it in early January 1932, after heavy
fighting.  Jinzhou was in a highly strategic location, and had played a
central role in the takeover of Manchuria, its seizure becoming the
focus of a major diplomatic dispute between the United States and Japan
and a key episode in the long chain of events which ultimately led to
Pearl Harbor ten years later.

when the Japanese began their attack on Manchuria in September 193 i,
the Young Marshal, Chang Hsueh-liang, was forced to abandon his
capital, Mukden, to the Japanese.  He decamped to Jinzhou with some
200,000 troops and set up his headquarters there.  In one of the first
such attacks in history, the Japanese bombed the city from the air.
When the Japanese troops entered Jinzhou they went on a rampage.

This was the town where Dr.  Xia, now age sixty-six, had to start again
from the bottom.  He could only afford to rent a mud hut about ten by
eight feet in size in a very poor part of town, a low-lying area by a
river, under a levee.  Most of the local shack owners were too poor to
afford a proper roof: they laid pieces of corrugated iron over their
four walls and put heavy stones on top to try to stop them from being
blown away in the frequent high winds.  The area was right on the edge
of the town on the other side of the river were sorghum fields.  When
they first arrived in December, the brown earth was frozen solid and so
was the river, which was about thirty yards wide at this point.  In the
spring, as the ice thawed, the ground around the hut turned to a
quagmire, and the stench of sewage, kept down in winter because it
immediately froze, permanently lodged in their nostrils.  In the summer
the area was infested with mosquitoes, and floods were a constant worry
because the river rose well above the level of the houses and the
embankments were poorly maintained.

My mother's overwhelming impression was of almost unbearable cold.
Every activity, not just sleeping, had to take place on the kang, which
took up most of the space in the hut, apart from a small stove in one
corner.  All three of them had to sleep together on the kang.  There
was no electricity or running water.  The toilet was a mud shack with a
communal pit.

Right opposite the house was a brightly painted temple dedicated to the
God of Fire.  People coming to pray in it would tie their horses up in
front of the Xias' shack.  When it got warmer, Dr.  Xia would take my
mother for walks along the riverbank in the evenings and recite
classical poetry to her, against the background of the magnificent
sunsets.  My grandmother would not accompany them:

there was no custom of husbands and wives taking walks together, and in
any case, her bound feet meant that walking could never be a pleasure
for her.

They were on the edge of starvation.  In Yixian the family had had a
supply of food from Dr.  Xia's own land, which meant they always had
some rice even after the Japanese had taken their cut.  Now their
income was sharply down and the Japanese were appropriating a far
greater proportion of the available food.  Much of what was produced
locally was forcibly exported to Japan, and the large Japanese army in
Manchuria took most of the remaining rice and wheat for itself.  The
local population could occasionally get hold of some maize or sorghum,
but even these were scarce.  The main food was acorn meal, which tasted
and smelled revolting.

My grandmother had never experienced such poverty, but this was the
happiest time of her life.  Dr.  Xia loved her, and she had her
daughter with her all the 6me.  She was no longer forced to go through
any of the tedious Manchu rituals, and the tiny mud hut was filled with
laughter.  She and Dr.  Xia sometimes passed the long evenings playing
cards.  The rules were that if Dr.  Xia lost, my grandmother would
smack him three times, and if she lost, Dr.  Xia would kiss her three
times.

My grandmother had many women friends in the neighborhood, which was
something new for her.  As the wife of a doctor she was respected, even
though he was not well off.  After years of being humiliated and
treated as chattel, she was now truly surrounded by freedom.

Every now and then she and her friends would put on an old Manchu
performance for themselves, playing hand drums while they sang and
danced.  The tunes they played consisted of very simple, repetitive
notes and rhythms, and the women made up the lyrics as they went along.
The married women sang about their sex lives, and the virgins asked
questions about sex.  Being mostly illiterate, the women used this as a
way to learn about the facts of life.

Through their singing, they also talked to each other about their lives
and their husbands, and passed on their gossip.

My grandmother loved these gatherings, and would often practice for
them at home.  She would sit on the kang, shaking the hand drum with
her left hand and singing to the beat, composing the lyrics as she went
along.  Often Dr.  Xia would suggest words.  My mother was too young to
be taken along to the gatherings, but she could watch my grandmother
rehearsing.  She was fascinated and parfcularly wanted to know what
words Dr.  Xia had suggested.

She knew they must be great fun, because he and her mother laughed so
much.  But when her mother repeated them for her, she 'fell into clouds
and fog."  She had no idea what they meant.

But life was tough.  Every day was a battle just to survive.

Rice and wheat were only available on the black market, so my
grandmother began selling off some of the jewelry

General Xue had given her.  She ate almost nothing herself, saying she
had already eaten, or that she was not hungry and would eat later. When
Dr.  Xia found out she was selling her jewelry, he insisted she stop:
"I am an old man," he said.

"Some day I will die, and you will have to rely on those jewels to
survive."

Dr.  Xia was working as a salaried doctor attached to another man's
medicine shop, which did not give him much chance to display his skill.
But he worked hard, and gradually his reputation began to grow.  Soon
he was invited to go on his first visit to a patient's home.  When he
came back that evening he was carrying a package wrapped in a cloth. He
winked at my mother and his wife and asked them to guess what was
inside the package.  My mother's eyes were glued to the steaming
bundle, and even before she could shout out "Steamed rolls!"  she was
already tearing the package open.  As she was devouring the rolls, she
looked up and met Dr.  Xia's twinkling eyes.  More than fifty years
later she can still remember his look of happiness,

My Grandmother Mama a Manchu Doctor 77 and even today she says she
cannot remember any tbod as delicious as those simple wheat rolls.

Home visits were important to doctors, because the families would pay
the doctor who made the call rather than his employer.  When the
patients were happy, or rich, the doctors would often be given handsome
rewards.

Grateful patients would also give doctors valuable presents at New Year
and on other special occasions.  After a number of home visits, Dr.
Xia's circumstances began to improve.

His reputation began to spread, too.  One day the wife of the
provincial governor fell into a coma, and he called in Dr.  Xia, who
managed to restore her to consciousness.

This was considered almost the equivalent of bringing a person back
from the grave.  The governor ordered a plaque to be made on which he
wrote in his own hand:

"Dr.  Xia, who gives life to people and society."  He ordered the
plaque to be carried through the town in procession.

Soon afterward the governor came to Dr.  Xia for a different kind of
help.  He had one wife and twelve concubines, but not one of them had
borne him a child.  The governor had heard that Dr.  Xia was
particularly skilled in questions of fertility.  Dr.  Xia prescribed
potions for the governor and his thirteen consorts, several of whom
became pregnant.

In fact, the problem had been the governor's, but the diplomatic Dr.
Xia treated the wife and the concubines as well.

The governor was overjoyed, and wrote an even larger plaque for Dr. Xia
inscribed: "The reincarnation of Kuanyin' (the Buddhist goddess of
fertility and kindness).  The new plaque was carried to Dr.  Xia's
house with an even larger procession than the first one.  After this,
people came to see Dr.  Xia from as far away as Harbin, 400 miles to
the north.  He became known as one of the 'four famous doctors' of
Manchukuo.

By the end of 1937, a year after they had arrived in Jinzhou, Dr.  Xia
was able to move to a bigger house just outside the old north gate of
the city.  It was far superior to the shack by the river.  Instead of
mud, it was made of red brick.  Instead of one room, it had no fewer
than three bedrooms.  Dr.  Xia was able to set up his own practice
again, and used the sitting room as his surgery.

The house occupied the south side of a big courtyard which was shared
with two other families, but only Dr.  Xia's house had a door which
opened directly into it.  The other two houses faced out onto the
street and had solid walls on the courtyard side, without even a window
looking onto it.  When they wanted to get into the courtyard they had
to go around through a gate from the street.  The north side of the
courtyard was a solid wall.  In the courtyard were cypresses and
Chinese ilex trees on which the three families used to hang up
clotheslines.  There were also some roses of Sharon, which were tough
enough to survive the harsh winters.  During the summer my grandmother
would put out her favorite annuals: white-edged morning glory,
chrysanthemums, dahlias, and garden balsam.

My grandmother and Dr.  Xia never had any children together.  He
subscribed to a theory that a man over the age of sixty-five should not
ejaculate, so as to conserve his sperm, which was considered the
essence of a man.  Years later my grandmother told my mother, somewhat
mysteriously, that through qigong Dr.  Xia developed a technique which
enabled him to have an orgasm without ejaculating.

For a man of his age he enjoyed extraordinary health.  He was never
ill, and took a cold shower every day, even in temperatures of minus io
F. He never touched alcohol or tobacco, in keeping with the injunctions
of the quasi religious sect to which he belonged, the Zai-li-hui
(Society of Reason).

Although he was a doctor himself, Dr.  Xia was not keen on taking
medicine, insisting that the way to good health was a sound body.  He
adamantly opposed any treatment which in his opinion cured one part of
the body while doing damage to another, and would not use strong
medicines because of the side effects they might have.  My mother and
grandmother often had to take medicines behind his back.  When they did
fall ill, he would always bring in another doctor, who was a
traditional Chinese doctor but also a shaman and believed that some
ailments were caused by evil spirits, which had to be placated or
exorcized by special religious techniques.

My mother was happy.  For the first time in her life she felt warmth
all around her.  No longer did she feel tension, as she had for the two
years at her grandparents', and there was none of the bullying she had
undergone for a whole year from Dr.  Xia's grandchildren.

She was particularly excited by the festivals which came around almost
every month.  There was no concept of the workweek among ordinary
Chinese.  Only government offices, schools, and Japanese factories had
a day off on Sunday.  For other people only festivals provided a break
from the daily routine.

On the twenty-third day of the twelfth moon, seven days before the
Chinese New Year, the Winter Festival began.

According to legend, this was the day when the Kitchen God, who had
been living above the stove with his wife, in the form of their
portraits, went up to Heaven to report on the behavior of the family to
the Celestial Emperor.  A good report would bring the family abundant
food in the kitchen in the coming year.  So on this day every household
would busily kowtow to the portraits of Lord and Lady Kitchen God
before they were set ablaze to signify their ascent to Heaven.
Grandmother would always ask my mother to stick some honey on their
lips.  She would also burn lifelike miniature horses and figures of
servants which she made out of sorghum plants so the royal couple would
have extra special service to make them happier and thus more inclined
to say many nice things about the Xias to the Celestial Emperor.

The next few days were spent preparing all sons of food.

Meat was cut into special shapes, and rice and soybeans were ground
into powder and made into buns, rolls, and dumplings.  The food was put
into the cellar to wait for the New Year.  With the temperature as low
as minus 2o F, the cellar was a natural refrigerator.

At midnight on Chinese New Year's Eve, a huge burst of fireworks was
let off, to my mother's great excitement.

She would follow her mother and Dr.  Xia outside and kowtow in the
direction from which the God of Fortune was supposed to be coming.  All
along the street, people were doing the same.  Then they would greet
each other with the words "May you run into good fortune."

At Chinese New Year people gave each other presents.

When dawn lit up the white paper in the windows to the east, my mother
would jump out of bed and hurry into her new finery: new jacket, new
trousers, new socks, and new shoes.  Then she and her mother called on
neighbors and friends, kowtowing to all the adults.  For every bang of
her head on the floor, she got a 'red wrapper' with money inside. These
packets were to last her the whole year as pocket money.

For the next fifteen days, the adults went round paying visits and
wishing each other good fortune.  Good fortune, namely money, was an
obsession with most ordinary Chinese.  People were poor, and in the Xia
household, like many others, the only time meat was in reasonably
abundant supply was at festival time.

The festivities would culminate on the fifteenth day with a carnival
procession followed by a lantern show after dark.

The procession centered on an inspection visit by the God of Fire.  The
god would be carried around the neighborhood to warn people of the
danger of fire; with most houses partly made of timber and the climate
dry and windy, fire was a constant hazard and source of terror, and the
statue of the god in the temple used to receive offerings all year
round.  The procession started at the temple of the God of Fire, in
front of the mud hut where the Xias had lived when they first came to
Jinzhou.  A replica of the statue, a

My Grandmother Marries a Manchu Doctor 8 I giant with red hair, beard,
eyebrows, and cloak, was carried on an open sedan chair by eight young
men.  It was followed by writhing dragons and lions, each made up of
several men, and by floats, stilts, and yangge dancers who waved the
ends of a long piece of colorful silk tied around their waists.
Fireworks, drums, and cymbals made a thundering noise.  My mother
skipped along behind the procession.

Almost every household displayed tantalizing foods along the route as
offerings to the deity, but she noticed that the deity jolted by rather
quickly, not touching any of it.

"Goodwill for the gods, offerings for the human stomachs!"

her mother told her.  In those days of scarcity my mother looked
forward keenly to the festivals, when she could satisfy her stomach.
She was quite indifferent to those occasions which had poetic rather
than gastronomic associations, and would wait impatiently for her
mother to guess the riddles stuck on the splendid lanterns hung at
people's front doors during the Lantern Festival, or for her mother to
tour the chrysanthemums in people's gardens on the ninth day of the
ninth moon.

During the Fair of the Town God's Temple one year, my grandmother
showed her a row of clay sculptures in the temple, all redecorated and
painted for the occasion.

They were scenes of Hell, showing people being punished for their sins.
My grandmother pointed out a clay figure whose tongue was being pulled
out at least a foot while simultaneously being cut up by two devils
with spiky hair standing on end like hedgehogs and eyes bulging like
frogs.

The man being tortured had been a liar in his previous life, she said
and this was what would happen to my mother if she told lies.

There were about a dozen groups of statues, set amid the buzzing crowds
and the mouth-watering food stalls, each one illustrating a moral
lesson.  My grandmother cheerfully showed my mother one horrible scene
after another, but when they came to one group of figures she whisked
her by without any explanation.  Only some years later did my mother
find out that it depicted a woman being sawed in half by two men.  The
woman was a widow who had remarried, and she was being sawed in half by
her two husbands because she had been the property of both of them.  In
those days many widows were frightened by this prospect and remained
loyal to their dead husbands, no matter how much misery that entailed.
Some even killed themselves if they were forced by their families to
remarry.

My mother realized that her mother's decision to marry Dr.  Xia had not
been an easy one.

3. "They All Say What a Happy Place Manchukuo Is' Life under the
Japanese

(1938-1945)

Early in 1938, my mother was nearly seven.  She was very bright, and
very keen to study.  Her parents thought she should begin school as
soon as the new school year started, immediately after Chinese New
Year.

Education was tightly controlled by the Japanese, especially the
history and ethics courses.  Japanese, not Chinese, was the official
language in the schools.  Above the fourth form in elementary school
teaching was entirely in Japanese, and most of the teachers were
Japanese.

On 11 September 1939, when my mother was in her second year in
elementary school, the emperor of Manchukuo, Pu Yi, and his wife came
to Jinzhou on an official visit.  My mother was chosen to present
flowers to the empress on her arrival.  A large crowd stood on a gaily
decorated dais, all holding yellow paper flags in the colors of
Manchukuo.  My mother was given a huge bouquet of flowers, and she was
full of self-confidence as she stood next to the brass band and a group
of VIPs in morning coats.  A boy about the same age as my mother was
standing

84 "They All Say What a Happy Place Manchukuo Is' stiffly near her with
a bouquet of flowers to present to Pu Yi.  As the royal couple appeared
the band struck up the Manchukuo national anthem.  Everyone sprang to
attention.  My mother stepped forward and curtsied, expertly balancing
her bouquet.  The empress was wearing a white dress and very fine long
white gloves up to her elbows.

My mother thought she looked extremely beautiful.  She managed to
snatch a glance at Pu Yi, who was in military uniform.  Behind his
thick spectacles she thought he had 'piggy eyes."

Apart from the fact that she was a star pupil, one reason my mother was
chosen to present flowers to the empress was that she always filled in
her nationality on registration forms as "Manchu," like Dr.  Xia, and
Manchukuo was supposed to be the Manchus' own independent state.  Pu Yi
was particularly useful to the Japanese because, as far as most people
were concerned, if they thought about it at all, they were still under
the Manchu emperor.  Dr.  Xia considered himself a loyal subject, and
my grandmother took the same view.  Traditionally, an important way in
which a woman expressed her love for her man was by agreeing with him
in everything, and this came naturally to my grandmother.  She was so
contented with Dr.  Xia that she did not want to turn her mind even
slightly in the direction of disagreement.

At school my mother was taught that her country was Manchukuo, and that
among its neighboring countries there were two republics of China one
hostile, led by Chiang Kai-shek; the other friendly, headed by
WangJingwei (Japan's puplSet ruler of part of China).  She was taught
no concept of a "China' of which Manchuria was part.

The pupils were educated to be obedient subjects of Manchukuo.  One of
the first songs my mother learned was'

Red boys and green gifts walk on the streets, They all say what a happy
place Manchukuo is.

LiE under the Japanese You are happy and I am happy, Everyone lives
peacefully and works joyfully free of any worries.

The teachers said that Manchukuo was a paradise on earth.

But even at her age my mother could see that if the place could be
called a paradise it was only for the Japanese.

Japanese children attended separate schools, which were well equipped
and well heated, with shining floors and clean windows.  The schools
for the local children were in dilapidated temples and crumbling houses
donated by private patrons.  There was no heating.  In winter the whole
class often had to run around the block in the middle of a lesson or
engage in collective foot stamping to ward off the cold.

Not only were the teachers mainly Japanese, they also used Japanese
methods, hitting the children as a matter of course.  The slightest
mistake or failure to observe the prescribed rules and etiquette, such
as a girl having her hair half an inch below her earlobes, was punished
with blows.  Both gifts and boys were slapped on the face, hard, and
boys were frequently struck on the head with a wooden club.  Another
punishment was to be made to kneel for hours in the snow.

When local children passed a Japanese in the street, they had to bow
and make way, even if the Japanese was younger than themselves.
Japanese children would often stop local children and slap them for no
reason at all.  The pupils had to bow elaborately to their teachers
every time they met them.  My mother joked to her friends that a
Japanese teacher passing by was like a whirlwind sweeping through a
field of grass you just saw the grass bending as the wind blew by.

Many adults bowed to the Japanese, too, for fear of offending them, but
the Japanese presence did not impinge greatly on the Xias at first.
Middle- and lower-echelon positions were held by locals, both Manchus
and Han

Chinese, like my great-grandfather, who kept his job as deputy police
chief of Yixian.  By 1940, there were about 15,000 Japanese in Jinzhou.
The people living in the next house to the Xias were Japanese, and my
grandmother was friendly with them.  The husband was a government
official.  Every morning his wife would stand outside the gate with
their three children and bow deeply to him as he got into a rickshaw to
go to work.  After that she would start her own work, kneading coal
dust into balls for fuel.

For reasons my grandmother and my mother never understood, she always
wore white gloves, which became filthy in no time.

The Japanese woman often visited my grandmother.  She was lonely, with
her husband hardly ever at home.  She would bring a little sake, and my
grandmother would prepare some snacks, like soy-pickled vegetables.  My
grandmother spoke a little Japanese and the Japanese woman a little
Chinese.  They hummed songs to each other and shed tears together when
they became emotional.  They often helped in each other's gardens, too.
The Japanese neighbor had very smart gardening tools, which my
grandmother admired greatly, and my mother was often invited over to
play in her garden.

But the Xias could not avoid hearing what the Japanese were doing.  In
the vast expanses of northern Manchuria villages were being burned and
the surviving population herded into 'strategic hamlets."  Over five
million people, about a sixth of the population, lost their homes, and
tens of thousands died.  Laborers were worked to death in mines under
Japanese guards to produce exports to Japan for Manchuria was
particularly rich in natural resources.  Many were deprived of salt and
did not have the energy to run away.

Dr.  Xia had argued for a long time that the emperor did not know about
the evil things being done because he was a virtual prisoner of the
Japanese.  But when Pu Yi changed the way he referred to Japan from
'our friendly neighbor

Life under the Japanese ~7 country' to 'the elder brother country' and
finally to 'parent country," Dr.  Xia banged his fist on the table and
called him 'that famous coward."  Even then, he said he ~sas not sure
how much responsibility the emperor should bear for the atrocities,
until two traumatic events changed the Xias' world.

One day in late 194x Dr.  Xia was in his surgery when a man he had
never seen came into the room.  He was dressed in rags, and his
emaciated body was bent almost double.  The man explained that he was a
railway coolie, and that he had been having agonizing stomach pains.
His work involved carrying heavy loads from dawn to dusk, 365 days a
year.  He did not know how he could go on, but if he lost his job he
would not be able to support his wife and newborn baby.

Dr.  Xia told him his stomach could not digest the coarse food he had
to eat.  On 1 June 1939, the government had announced that henceforth
rice was reserved for the Japanese and a small number of collaborators.
Most of the local population had to subsist on a diet of acorn meal and
sorghum, which were difficult to digest.  Dr.  Xia gave the man some
medicine free of charge, and asked my grandmother to give him a small
bag of rice which she had bought illegally on the black market.

Not long afterward, Dr.  Xia heard that the man had died in a forced
labor camp.  After leaving the surgery he had eaten the rice, gone back
to work, and then vomited at the railway yard.  A Japanese guard had
spotted rice in his vomit and he had been arrested as an 'economic
criminal' and hauled off to a camp.  In his weakened state, he survived
only a few days.  When his wife heard what had happened to him, she
drowned herself with their baby.

The incident plunged Dr.  Xia and my grandmother into deep grief.  They
felt responsible for the man's death.  Many times Dr.  Xia would say:
"Rice can murder as well as save!

A small bagful, three lives!"  He started to call Pu Yi 'that
tyrant."

Shortly after this, tragedy struck closer to home.  Dr.  Xia's youngest
son was working as a schoolteacher in Yixian.  As in every school in
Manchukuo, there was a big portrait of Pu Yi in the office of the
Japanese headmaster, which everyone had to salute when they entered the
room.

One day Dr.  Xia's son forgot to bow to Pu Yi.  The headmaster shouted
at him to bow at once and slapped him so hard across the face he
knocked him off balance.  Dr.  Xia's son was enraged: "Do I have to
bend double every day?

Can I not stand up straight even for a momenff I have just done my
obeisance in morning assembly .... The headmaster slapped him again and
barked: "This is your emperor!  You Manchurians need to be taught
elementary propriety!"  Dr.  Xia's son shouted back: "Big deal!  It's
only a piece of paper?  At that moment two other teachers, both locals,
came by and managed to stop him from saying anything more
incriminating.  He recovered his self-control and eventually forced
himself to perform a bow of sorts to the portrait.

That evening a friend came to his house and told him that word was out
that he had been branded a 'thought criminal' an offense which was
punishable by imprisonment, and possibly death.  He ran away, and his
family never heard of him again.  Probably he was caught and died in
prison, or else in a labor camp.  Dr.  Xia never recovered from the
blow, which turned him into a determined foe of Manchukuo and of Pu
Yi.

This was not the end of the story.  Because of his brother's 'crime,"
local thugs began to harass De-gui, Dr.  Xia's only surviving son,
demanding protection money and claiming he had failed in his duty as
the elder brother.  He paid up, but the gangsters only demanded more.
In the end, he had to sell the medicine shop and leave Yixian for
Mukden, where he opened a new shop.

By now, Dr.  Xia was becoming more and more successful.

He treated Japanese as well as locals.  Sometimes after

Life under the Japanese So treating a senior Japanese officer or a
collaborator he would say, "I wish he were dead," but his personal
views never affected his professional attitude.

"A patient is a human being," he used to say.

"That is all a doctor should think about.  He should not mind what kind
of a human being he is."

My grandmother had meanwhile brought her mother to Jinzhou.  When she
left home to marry Dr.  Xia, her mother had been left alone in the
house with her husband, who despised her, and the two Mongolian
concubines, who hated her.  She began to suspect that the concubines
wanted to poison her and her small son, Yu-lin.  She always used silver
chopsticks, as the Chinese believe that silver will turn black if it
comes into contact with poison, and she never touched her food or let
Yu-lin touch it until she had tested it out on her dog.  One day, a few
months after my grandmother had left the house, the dog dropped dead.

For the first time in her life, she had a big row with her husband; and
with the support of her mother-in-law, old Mrs.  Yang, she moved out
with Yu-lin into rented accommodation.  Old Mrs.  Yang was so disgusted
with her son that she left home with them, and never saw her son again
except at her deathbed.

In the first three years, Mr.  Yang reluctantly sent them a monthly
allowance, but at the beginning of 1939 this stopped, and Dr.  Xia and
my grandmother had to support the three of them.  In those days there
was no maintenance law, as there was no proper legal system, so a wife
was entirely at the mercy of her husband.  When old Mrs.  Yang died in
1942 my great-grandmother and Yu-lin moved to Jinzhou, and went to live
in Dr.  Xia's house.  She considered herself and her son to be
second-class citizens, living on charity.  She spent her time washing
the family's clothes and cleaning up obsessively, nervously obsequious
toward her daughter and Dr.  Xia.  She was a pious Buddhist and every
day in her prayers asked Buddha not to reincarnate her as a woman.

"Let me become a cat or a dog, but

9o "They All Say What a Happy Place Manchukuo Is' not a woman," was her
constant murmur as she shuffled around the house, oozing apology with
every step.

My grandmother had also brought her sister, Lan, whom she loved dearly,
to Jinzhou.  Lan had married a man in Yixian who turned out to be a
homosexual.  He had offered her to a rich uncle, for whom he worked and
who owned a vegetable-oil factory.  The uncle had raped several female
members of the household, including his young granddaughter.  Because
he was the head of the family, wielding immense power over all its
members, Lan did not dare resist him.  But when her husband offered her
to his uncle's business parmer she refused.  My grandmother had to pay
the husband to disown her (x/u), as a woman could not ask for a
divorce.  My grandmother brought her to Jinzhou, where she was
remarried, to a man called Pei-o.

Pei-o was a warder in the prison, and the couple often visited my
grandmother.  Pei-o's stories made my mother's hair stand on end.  The
prison was crammed with political prisoners.  Pei-o often said how
brave they were, and how they would curse the Japanese even as they
were being tortured.  Torture was standard practice, and the prisoners
received no medical treaunent.  Their wounds were just left to rot.

Dr.  Xia offered to go and treat the prisoners.  On one of his first
visits he was introduced by Pei-o to a friend of his called Dong, an
executioner, who operated the garrote.

The prisoner was tied to a chair with a rope around his neck.  The rope
was then slowly tightened.  Death was excruciatingly slow.

Dr.  Xia knew from his brother-in-law that Dong's conscience was
troubled, and that whenever he was due to garrote someone, he had to
get himself drunk beforehand.

Dr.  Xia invited Dong to his house.  He offered him gifts and suggested
that perhaps he could avoid tightening the rope all the way.  Dong said
he would see what he could do.  There was usually a Japanese guard or a
trusted collaborator present, but sometimes, if the victim was not

Lip under the Japanese 9I important enough, the Japanese did not bother
to show up.

At other times, they left before the prisoner was actually dead.  On
such occasions, Dong hinted, he could stop the garrote before the
prisoner died.

After prisoners were garroted, their bodies were put into thin wooden
boxes and taken on a cart to a stretch of barren land on the outskirts
of town called South Hill, where they were tipped into a shallow pit.
The place was infested with wild dogs, who lived on the corpses.  Baby
gifts who had been killed by their families, which was common in those
days, were also often dumped in the pit.

Dr.  Xia struck up a relationship with the old cart driver, and gave
him money from time to time.  Occasionally the driver would come into
the surgery and start rambling on about life, in an apparently
incoherent way, but eventually he would begin talking about the
graveyard: "I told the dead souls it was not my fault they had ended up
there.  I told them that, for my part, I wished them well.

"Come back next year for your anniversary, dead souls.  But in the
meantime, if you wish to fly away to look for better bodies to be
reincarnated in, go in the direction your head is pointed.  That is a
good path for you."  Dong and the cart driver never spoke to each other
about what they were doing, and Dr.  Xia never knew how many people
they had saved.  After the war the rescued 'corpses' chipped in and
raised money for Dong to buy a house and some land.  The cart driver
had died.

One man whose life they helped save was a distant cousin of my
grandmother's called Han-chen, who had been an important figure in the
resistance movement.

Because Jinzhou was the main raiiway junction north of the Great Wall,
it became the assembly point for the Japanese in their assault on China
proper, which started in July 1937.  Security was extremely tight, and
Han-chen's organization was infiltrated by a spy, and the entire group
was arrested.  They were all tortured.  First water with hot chiles was
forced down their noses; then their faces were slapped
with a shoe which had
sharp nails sticking out of the sole.

Then most of them were executed.  For a long time the Xias thought
Han-chen was dead, until one day Uncle Pei-o told them that he was
still alive but about to be executed.  Dr.  Xia immediately contacted
Dong.

On the night of the execution Dr.  Xia and my grandmother went to South
Hill with a carriage.  They parked behind a clump of trees and waited.
They could hear the wild dogs rummaging around by the pit, from which
rose the sickly stench of decomposing flesh.  At last a cart appeared.
Through the darkness they could dimly see the old driver climbing down
and tipping some bodies out of wooden boxes.  They waited for him to
drive off and then went over to the pit.  After groping among the
corpses they found Han-chen, but could not tell if he was dead or
alive.

Eventually they realized he was still breathing.  He had been so badly
tortured he could not walk, so with great effort they lifted him into
the carriage and drove him back to their house.

They hid him in a tiny room in the innermost corner of the house.  Its
one door led into my mother's room, to which the only other access was
from her parents' bedroom.  No one would ever go into the room by
chance.  As the house was the only one which had direct access to the
courtyard, Han-chen could exercise there in safety, as long as someone
kept watch.

There was the danger of a raid by the police or the local neighborhood
committees.  Early on in the occupation the Japanese had set up a
widespread system of neighbor hood control.  They made the local big
shots the heads of these units, and these neighborhood bosses helped
collect taxes and kept a round-the-clock watch for 'lawless elements."
It was a form of institutionalized gangsterism, in which 'protection'
and informing were the keys to power.

The Japanese also offered large rewards for turning people in.  The
Manchukuo police were less of a threat than ordinary civilians.  In
fact, many of the police were quite anti

Lip under the Japanese 93 Japanese.  One of their main jobs was to
check people's registration, and they used to carry out frequent
house-to house searches.  But they would announce their arrival by
shouting out "Checking registrations!  Checking registrations!"  so
that anyone who wanted to hide had plenty of time.  Whenever Han-chen
or my grandmother heard this shout she would hide him in a pile of
dried sorghum stacked in the end room for fuel.  The police would
saunter into the house and sit down and have a cup of tea, telling my
grandmother rather apologetically, "All this is just a formality, you
know .... '

At the time my mother was eleven.  Even though her parents did not tell
her what was going on, she knew she must not talk about Han-chen being
in the house.  She learned discretion from childhood.

Slowly, my grandmother nursed Han-chen back to health, and after three
months he was well enough to move on.  It was an emotional farewell.

"Elder sister and elder brother-in-law," he said, "I will never forget
that I owe my life to you.  As soon as I have the chance, I will repay
my great debt to you both."  Three years later he came back and was as
good as his word.

As part of their education, my mother and her classmates had to watch
newsreels of Japan's progress in the war.  Far from being ashamed of
their brutality, the Japanese vaunted it as a way to inculcate fear.
The films showed Japanese soldiers cutting people in half and prisoners
tied to stakes being torn to pieces by dogs.  There were lingering
close-ups of the victims' terror-stricken eyes as their attackers came
at them.  The Japanese watched the eleven and twelve-year-old
schoolgirls to make sure they did not shut their eyes or try to stick a
handkerchief in their mouths to stifle their screams.  My mother had
nightmares for years to come.

During 1942, with their army stretched out across China, Southeast
Asia, and the Pacific Ocean, the Japanese found themselves running
short of labor.  My mother's whole class was conscripted to work in a
textile factory, as were the Japanese children.  The local girls had to
walk about four miles each way; the Japanese children went by truck.
The local girls got a thin gruel made from moldy maize with dead worms
floating in it; the Japanese girls had packed lunches with meat,
vegetables, and fruit.

The Japanese girls had easy jobs, like cleaning windows.

But the local girls had to operate complex spinning machines, which
were highly demanding and dangerous even for adults.  Their main job
was to reconnect broken threads while the machines were running at
speed.  If they did not spot the broken thread, or reconnect it fast
enough, they would be savagely beaten by the Japanese supervisor.

The girls were terrified.  The combination of nervousness, cold,
hunger, and fatigue led to many accidents.  Over half of my mother's
fellow pupils suffered injuries.  One day my mother saw a shuttle spin
out of a machine and knock out the eye of the girl next to her.  All
the way to the hospital the Japanese supervisor scolded the girl for
not being careful enough.

After the stint in the factory, my mother moved up into junior high
school.  Times had changed since my grandmother's youth, and young
women were no longer confined to the four walls of their home.  It was
socially acceptable for women to get a high school education.  However,
boys and girls received different educations.  For girls the aim was to
turn them into 'gracious wives and good mothers," as the school motto
put it.  They learned what the Japanese called 'the way of a woman'
looking after a household, cooking and sewing, the tea ceremony, flower
arrangement, embroidery, drawing, and the appreciation of art.  The
single most important thing imparted was how to please one's husband.
This included how to dress, how to do one's hair, how to bow, and,
above all, how to obey, without question.  As my grandmother put it, my
mother seemed to have 'rebellious bones," and learned almost none of
these skills, even cooking.

Some exams took the form of practical assignments.

such as preparing a particular dish or arranging flowers.

The examination board was made up of local officials, both Japanese and
Chinese, and as well as assessing the exams, they also sized up the
girls.  Photos of them wearing prett3' aprons they had designed
themselves were put up on the notice board with their assignments.
Japanese officials often picked fiances from among the girls, as
intermarriage between Japanese men and local women was encouraged. Some
girls were also selected to go to Japan to be married to men they had
not met.  Quite often the girls or rather their families were willing. 
Toward the end of the occupation one of my mother's friends was chosen
to go to Japan, but she missed the ship and was still in JMzhou when
the Japanese surrendered.  My mother looked askance at her.

In contrast with their Chinese Mandarin predecessors, who shunned
physical activity, the Japanese were keen on sports, which my mother
loved.  She had recovered from her hip injury, and was a good runner.
Once she was selected to run in an important race.  She trained for
weeks, and was all keyed up for the big day, but a few days before the
race the coach, who was Chinese, took her aside and asked her not to
try to win.  He said he could not explain why.  My mother understood.
She knew the Japanese did not like to be beaten by the Chinese at
anything.  There was one other local girl in the race, and the coach
asked my mother to pass on the same advice to her, but not to tell her
that it came from him.  On the day of the race my mother did not even
finish in the first six.  Her friends could tell she was not trying.
But the other local girl could not bear to hold back, and came in
first.

The Japanese soon took their revenge.  Every morning there was an
assembly, presided over by the headmaster, who was nicknamed "Donkey'
because his name when read in the Chinese way (Mao-h) sounded like the
word for donkey (mao-h).  He would bark out orders in harsh,

guttural tones for the four low bows toward the four designated points.
First, "Distant worship of the imperial capital!"  in the direction of
Tokyo.  Then, "Distant worship of the national capital!"  toward
Hsinking, the capital of Manchukuo.  Next, "Devoted worship of the
Celestial Emperor!"  meaning the emperor of Japan.  Finally, "Devoted
worship of the imperial portrait!"  this time to the portrait of Pu Yi.
After this came a shallower bow to the teachers.

On this particular morning, after the bowing was completed, the girl
who had won the race the day before was suddenly dragged out of her row
by "Donkey," who claimed that her bow to Pu Yi had been less than
ninety degrees.  He slapped and kicked her and announced that she was
being expelled.  This was a catastrophe for her and her family.

Her parents hurriedly married her off to a petty government official.
After Japan's defeat her husband was branded as a collaborator, and as
a result the only job his wife could get was in a chemical plant. There
were no pollution controls, and when my mother went back to Jinzhou in
1984 and tracked her down she had gone almost blind from the chemicals.
She was wry about the ironies of her life: having beaten the Japanese
in a race, she had ended up being treated as a kind of collaborator. 
Even so, she said she had no regrets about winning the race.

It was difficult for people in Manchukuo to get much idea of what was
happening in the rest of the world, or of how Japan was faring in the
war.  The fighting was a long way away, news was strictly censored, and
the radio churned out nothing but propaganda.  But they got a sense
that Japan was in trouble from a number of signs, especially the
worsening food situation.

The first real news came in summer 1943, when the newspapers reported
that one of Japan's allies, Italy, had surrendered.  By the middle of
1944 some Japanese civilians staffing government offices in Manchukuo
were being conscripted.  Then, on 19July 1944, American B-29s appeared
in the sky over Jinzhou for the first time, though they did not bomb
the city.  The Japanese ordered even household to dig air-raid
shelters, and there was a compulsory air-raid drill every day at
school.  One day a girl in my mother's class picked up a fire
extinguisher and squirted it at a Japanese teacher whom she
particularly loathed.

Previously, this would have brought dire retribution,-but now she was
allowed to get away with it.  The fide was turning.

There had been a long-standing campaign to catch flies and rats.  The
pupils had to chop off the rats' tails, put them in envelopes, and hand
them in to the police.  The flies had to be put in glass bottles.  The
police counted every rat tail and every dead fly.  One day in 1944 when
my mother handed in a glass bottle full to the brim with flies, the
Manchukuo policeman said to her: "Not enough for a meal."  When he saw
the surprised look on her face, he said: "Don't you know?  The Nips
like dead flies.  They fry them and eat them!"  My mother could see
from the cynical gleam in his eye that he no longer regarded the
Japanese as awesome.

My mother was excited and full of anticipation, but during the autumn
of 1944 a dark cloud had appeared: her home did not seem to be as happy
as before.  She sensed there was discord between her parents.

The fifteenth night of the eighth moon of the Chinese year was the
Mid-Autumn Festival, the festival of family union.  On that night my
grandmother would place a table with melons, round cakes, and buns
outside in the moonlight, in accordance with the custom.  The reason
this date was the festival of family union is that the Chinese word for
'union' (yuan) is the same as that for 'round' or 'unbroken'; the full
autumn moon was supposed to look especially, splendidly, round at this
time.  All the items of food eaten on that day had to be round too.

In the silky moonlight, my grandmother would tell my mother stories
about the moon: the largest shadow in it was a giant cassia tree which
a certain lord, Wu Gang, was spending his entire life trying to cut
down.  But the tree was enchanted and he was doomed to repeated
failu/e.  My mother would stare up into the sky and listen,
fascinated.

The full moon was mesmerizingly beautiful to her, but on that night she
was not allowed to describe it, because she was forbidden by her mother
to utter the word 'round," as Dr.  Xia's family had been broken up. Dr.
Xia would be downcast for the whole day, and for several days before
and after the festival.  My grandmother would even lose her usual flair
for storytelling.

On the night of the festival in 1944, my mother and my grandmother were
sitting under a trellis covered with winter melons and beans, gazing
through the gaps in the shadowy leaves into the vast, cloudless sky. My
mother started to say, "The moon is particularly round tonight," but my
grandmother interrupted her sharply, then suddenly burst into tears.
She rushed into the house, and my mother heard her sobbing and
shrieking: "Go back to your son and grandsons!  Leave me and my
daughter and go your own way!"  Then, in gasps between sobs, she
said:

"Was it my fault or yours that your son killed himself?

Why should we have to bear the burden year after year?  It isn't me who
is stopping you seeing your children.  It is they who have refused to
come and see you .... Since they had left Yixian, only De-gui, Dr.
Xia's second son, had visited them.  My mother did not hear a sound
from

Dr.  Xia.

From then on my mother felt there was something wrong.  Dr.  Xia became
increasingly taciturn, and she instinctively avoided him.  Every now
and then my grandmother would become tearful, and murmur to herself
that she and Dr.  Xia could never be completely happy with the heavy
price they had paid for their love.  She would hug my mother close and
tell her that she was the only thing she had in her life.

Li.~ under the Japanese 99

My mother was in an uncharacterisfically melancholy mood as winter
descended on Jinzhou.  Even the appearance of a second flight of
American B-29s in the clear, cold December sky failed to lift her
spirits.

The Japanese were becoming more and more edgy.  One day one of my
mother's school friends got hold of a book by a banned Chinese writer.
Looking for somewhere quiet to read, she went off into the countryside,
where she found a cavern which she thought was an empty air-raid
shelter.

Groping around in the dark, her hand touched what felt like a light
switch.  A piercing noise erupted.  What she had touched was an alarm.
She had stumbled into an arms depot.  Her legs turned to jelly.  She
tried to run, but got only a couple of hundred yards before some
Japanese soldiers caught her and dragged her away.

Two days later the whole school was marched to a barren, snow-covered
stretch of ground outside the west gate, in a bend of the Xiaoling
River.  Local residents had also been summoned there by the
neighborhood chiefs.

The children were told they were to witness 'the punishment of an evil
person who disobeys Great Japan."  Suddenly my mother saw her friend
being hauled by Japanese guards to a spot right in front of her.  The
girl was in chains and could hardly walk.  She had been tortured, and
her face was so swollen that my mother could barely recognize her. Then
the Japanese soldiers lifted their rifles and pointed them at the girl,
who seemed to be trying to say something, but no sound came out. There
was a crack of bullets, and the girl's body slumped as her blood began
to drip onto the snow.

"Donkey," the Japanese headmaster, was scanning the rows of his pupils.
With a tremendous effort, my mother tried to hide her emotions.  She
forced herself to look at the body of her friend, which by now was
lying in a glistening red patch in the white snow.

She heard someone trying to suppress sobs.  It was Mi~s Tanaka, a young
Japanese woman teacher whom she liked.

In an instant "Donkey' was on Miss Tanaka, slapping and

kicking her.  She fell to the ground, and tried to roll out of the way
of his boots, but he went on kicking her ferociously.

She had betrayed the Japanese race, he bawled.  Eventually "Donkey'
stopped, looked up at the pupils, and barked the order to march off.

My mother took one last look at the crooked body of her teacher and the
corpse of her friend and forced down her hate.

4. "Slaves Who Have No Country of Your Own' Ruled by Different
Masters

(1945-1947)

In May 1945 the news spread around Jinzhou that Germany had surrendered
and that the war in Europe was over.  US planes were flying over the
area much more often:

B-19s were bombing other cities in Manchuria, though Jinzhou was not
attacked.  The feeling that Japan would soon be defeated swept through
the city.

On 8 August my mother's school was ordered to go to a shrine to pray
for the victory of Japan.  The next day, Soviet and Mongolian troops
entered Manchukuo.  News came through that the Americans had dropped
two atom bombs on Japan: the locals cheered the news.  The following
days were punctuated by air-raid scares, and school stopped.  My mother
stayed at home helping to dig an air-raid shelter.

On 13 August the Xias heard that Japan was suing for peace.  Two days
later a Chinese neighbor who worked in the government rushed into their
house to tell them' there was going to be an important announcement on
the radio.  Dr.  Xia stopped work and came and sat with my grandmother
in the
courtyard.  The announcer said that the Japanese emperor had
surrendered.  Immediately afterward came the news that Pu Yi had
abdicated as emperor of Manchukuo.  People crowded into the streets in
a state of high excitement.  My mother went to her school to see what
was happening there.  The place seemed dead, except for a faint noise
coming from one of the offices.  She crept up to have a look: through
the window she could see the Japanese teachers huddled together
weeping.

She hardly slept a wink that night and was up at the crack of dawn.
When she opened the front door in the morning she saw a small crowd in
the street.  The bodies of a Japanese woman and two children were lying
in the road.  A Japanese officer had committed hara-kiri; his family
had been lynched.

One morning a few days after the surrender, the Xias' Japanese
neighbors were found dead.  Some said they had poisoned themselves. All
overJinzhou Japanese were committing suicide or being lynched. Japanese
houses were looted and my mother noticed that one of her poor neighbors
suddenly had quite a lot of valuable items for sale.

Schoolchildren revenged themselves on their Japanese teachers and beat
them up ferociously.  Some Japanese left their babies on the doorsteps
of local families in the hope that they would be saved.  A number of
Japanese women were raped; many shaved their heads to try to pass as
men.

My mother was worried about Miss Tanaka, who was the only teacher at
her school who never slapped the pupils and the only Japanese who had
shown distress when my mother's schoolfriend had been executed.  She
asked her parents if she could hide her in their house.  My grandmother
looked anxious, but said nothing.  Dr.  Xia just nodded.

My mother borrowed a set of clothes from her aunt Lan, who was about
the teacher's size, then went and found Miss Tanaka, who was barricaded
in her aparunent.  The

Ruled by Different Masters I o3 clothes fit her well.  She was taller
than the average Japanese woman, and could easily pass for a Chinese.
In case anybody asked, they would say she was my mother's cousin.

The Chinese have so many cousins no one can keep track of them.  She
moved into the end room, which had once been Han-chen's refuge.

In the vacuum left by the Japanese surrender and the collapse of the
Manchukuo regime the victims were not just Japanese.  The city was in
chaos.  At night there were gunshots and frequent screams for help. The
male members of the household, including my grandmother's
fifteen-year-old brother Yu-lin and Dr.  Xia's apprentices, took turns
keeping guard on the roof every night, armed with stones, axes, and
cleavers.  Unlike my grandmother, my mother was not scared at all.  My
grandmother was amazed: "You have your father's blood in your veins,"
she used to say to her.

The looting, raping, and killing continued until eight days after the
Japanese surrender, when the population was informed that a new army
would be arriving the Soviet Red Army.  On 23 August the neighborhood
chiefs told residents to go to the railway station the next day to
welcome the Russians.  Dr.  Xia and my grandmother stayed at home, but
my mother joined the large, high-spirited crowd of young people holding
colorful triangle-shaped paper flags.  As the train pulled in, the
crowd started waving their flags and shouting' Wula' (the Chinese
approximation of Ura, the Russian word for "Hurrah').  My mother had
imagined the Soviet soldiers as victorious heroes with impressive
beards, riding on large horses.  What she saw was a group of shabbily
dressed" pale-skinned youths.

Apart from the occasional fleeting glimpse of some mysterious figure in
a passing car, these were the first white people my mother had ever
seen.

About a thousand Soviet troops were stationed in Jinzhou, and when they
first arrived people felt grateful to them for helping to get rid of
the Japanese.  But the

104 "Slaves Who Have No Country of Your Own' Russians brought new
problems.  Schools had closed down when the Japanese surrendered, and
my mother was getting private lessons.  One day on her way home from
the tutor's, she saw a truck parked by the side of the road:

some Russian soldiers were standing beside it handing out bolts of
textiles.  Under the Japanese, cloth had been strictly rationed.  She
went over to have a look; it turned out the cloth was from the factory
where she had worked when she was in primary school.  The Russians were
swapping it for watches, clocks, and knickknacks.  My mother remembered
that there was an old clock buried somewhere at the bottom of a chest
at home.  She rushed back and dug it out.  She was a bit disappointed
to find it was broken, but the Russian soldiers were overjoyed and gave
her a bolt of beautiful white cloth with a delicate pink flower pattern
on it.  Over supper, the family sat shaking their heads in disbelief at
these strange foreigners who were so keen on useless old broken clocks
and baubles.

Not only were the Russians distributing goods from the factories, they
were also dismantling entire factories, including Jinzhou's two oil
refineries, and shipping the equipment back to the Soviet Union.  They
said these were 'reparations," but for the locals what this meant was
that industry was crippled.

Russian soldiers would walk into people's homes and simply take
anything they fancied watches and clothes in particular.  Stories about
Russians raping local women swept Jinzhou like wildfire.  Many women
went into hiding for fear of their 'liberators."  Very soon the city
was seething with anger and anxiety.

The Xias' house was outside the city walls, and was very poorly
protected.  A friend of my mother's offered to lend them a house inside
the city gates, surrounded by high stone walls.  The family decamped
immediately, taking my mother's Japanese teacher with them.  The move
meant that my mother had to walk much farther about thirty minutes each
way- to her tutor's.  Dr.  Xia insisted on taking her there and
collecting her in the afternoon.  My mother did not want him to walk so
far, so she would walk part of the way back on her own and he would
meet her.  One day a jeep-load of laughing Russian soldiers skidded to
a halt near her and the Russians jumped out and started running in her
direction.  She ran as fast as she could, with the Russians pounding
after her.  After a few hundred yards she caught sight of her
stepfather in the distance, brandishing his walking stick.  The
Russians were close behind, and my mother turned into a deserted
kindergarten she knew well, which was like a labyrinth.  She hid there
for over an hour and then sneaked out the back door and got home
safely.  Dr.  Xia had seen the Russians chasing my mother into the
building; to his immense relief they soon came out again, obviously
baffled by the layout.

just over a week after the Russians arrived, my mother was told by the
chief of her neighborhood committee to attend a meeting the following
evening.  When she got there she saw a number of shabby Chinese men and
a few women making speeches about how they had fought eight years to
defeat the Japanese so that ordinary people could be the masters of a
new China.  These were Communists Chinese Communists.  They had entered
the city the previous day, without fanfare or warning.  The women
Communists at the meeting wore shapeless clothes exactly like the men.
My mother thought to herself: How could you claim to have defeated the
Japanese?  You haven't even got decent guns or clothes.  To her, the
Communists looked poorer and scruffier than beggars.

She was disappointed because she had imagined them as big and handsome,
and superhuman.  Her uncle Pei-o, the prison warder, and Dong, the
executioner, had told her that the Communists were the bravest
prisoners: "They have the strongest bones," her uncle often said.

"They sang and shouted slogans and cursed the Japanese until the very
last minute before they were strangled," said Dong.

The Communists put up notices calling on the population to keep order,
and started arresting collaborators and people who had worked for the
Japanese security forces.

Among those arrested was Yang, my grandmother's father, still deputy
police chief of Yixian.  He was imprisoned in his own jail and his
boss, the police chief, was executed.

The Communists soon restored order and got the economy going again. The
food situation, which had been desperate, improved markedly.  Dr. Xia
was able to start seeing patients again, and my mother's school
reopened.

The Communists were billeted in the houses of local people.  They
seemed honest and unpretentious, and would chat with the families: "We
don't have enough educated people," they used to say to one friend of
my mother's.

"Come and join us and you can become a county chief."

They needed recruits.  At the time of the Japanese surrender, both
Communists and Kuomintang had tried to occupy as much territory as they
could, but the Kuomintang had a much larger and better-equipped army.
Both were maneuvering for position in preparation for renewing the
civil war which had been partly suspended for the previous eight years
in order to fight the Japanese.  In fact, fighting between Communists
and Kuomintang had already broken out.  Manchuria was the crucial
battleground because of its economic assets.  Because they were nearby,
the Communists had got their forces into Manchuria first, with
virtually no assistance from the Russians.

But the Americans were helping Chiang Kai-shek establish himself in the
area by ferrying tens of thousands of Kuomintang troops to North China.
At one point the Americans tried to land some of them at Huludao, the
port about thirty miles from Jinzhou, but had to withdraw under fire
from Chinese Communists.  The Kuomintang troops were forced to land
south of the Great Wall and make their way north by train.  The United
States gave them air cover.

Altogether, over 50,000 US Marines landed in North China, occupying
Peking and Tianjin.

The Russians formally recognized Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang as the
government of China.  By 11 November, the Soviet Red Army had left the
Jinzhou area and pulled back to northern Manchuria, as part of a
commitment by Stalin to withdraw from the area within three months of
victory.  This left the Chinese Communists alone in control of the
city.  One evening in late November my mother was walking home from
school when she saw large numbers of soldiers hurriedly gathering their
weapons and equipment and moving in the direction of the south gate.

She knew there had been heavy fighting in the surrounding countryside
and guessed the Communists must be leaving.

This withdrawal was in line with the strategy of the Communist leader
Mao Zedong not to try to hold cities, where the Kuomintang would have
the military advantage, but to retreat to the rural areas.

"To surround the cities with our countryside and eventually take the
cities' was Mao's guideline for the new phase.

On the day after the Chinese Communists withdrew from Jinzhou, a new
army entered the city the fourth in as many months.  This army had
clean uniforms and gleaming new American weapons.  It was the
Kuomintang.

People ran out of their houses and gathered in the narrow mud streets,
clapping and cheering.  My mother squeezed her way to the front of the
excited crowd.  Suddenly she found she was waving her arms and cheering
loudly.  These soldiers really look like the army which beat the
Japanese, she thought to herself.  She ran home in a state of high
excitement to tell her parents about the smart new soldiers.

There was a festival atmosphere inJinzhou.  People competed to invite
troops to stay in their homes.  One officer came to live with the Xias.
He behaved extremely respectfully, and the family all liked him.  My
grandmother and Dr.  Xia felt that the Kuomintang would maintain law
and order and ensure peace at last.

But the goodwill people had felt toward the Kuomintang soon turned to
bitter disappointment.  Most of the officials

came from other parts of China, and talked down to the local people,
addressing them as Wang-guo-nu ("Slaves who have no country of your
own') and lecturing them about how they ought to be grateful to the
Kuomintang for liberating them from the Japanese.  One evening there
was a party at my mother's school for the students and Kuomintang
officers.  The three-year-old daughter of one official recited a speech
which began: "We, the Kuomintang, have been fighting the Japanese for
eight years and have now saved you, who were the slaves of Japan ....
My mother and her friends walked out.

My mother was also disgusted by the way the Kuomintang rushed to grab
concubines.  By early 1946 Jinzhou was filling up with troops.  My
mother's school was the only girls' school in town, and officers and
officials descended on it in droves in search of concubines or,
occasionally, wives.  Some of the girls got married willingly, while
others were unable to say no to their families, who thought that
marrying an officer would give them a good start in life.

At fifteen, my mother was highly marriageable.  She had grown into a
very attractive and popular young woman, and she was the star pupil at
her school.  Several officers had already proposed, but she told her
parents she did not want any of them.  One, who was chief of staff of a
general, threatened to send a sedan chair to carry her off after his
gold bars had been refused.  My mother was eavesdropping outside the
door as he put this proposal to her parents.

She burst in and told him to his face that she would kill herself in
the sedan chair.  Fortunately, not long afterward his unit was ordered
out of the city.

My mother had made up her mind to choose her own husband.  She was
disenchanted with the treatment of women, and hated the whole system of
concubinage.  Her parents supported her, but they were harassed by
offers, and had to deploy intricate, nerve-racking diplomacy to find
ways of saying no without unleashing reprisals.

One of my mother's teachers was a young woman called

Miss Liu, who liked her very much.  In China, if people are fond of
you, they often try to make you an honor an member of their family.  At
this time, although they ~'ere not so segregated as in my grandmother's
days, there were not many opportunities for boys and girls to mix, so
being introduced to the brother or sister of a friend was a common way
for young people who did not like the idea of arranged marriages to get
to know each other. Miss Liu introduced my mother to her brother.  But
first Mr.  and Mrs. Liu had to approve the relationship.

Early in 1946, my mother was invited to spend the Chinese New Year at
the Lius' house, which was quite grand.  Mr.  Liu was one of the
biggest shop owners in Jinzhou.  The son, who was about nineteen,
seemed to be a man of the world; he was wearing a dark-green suit with
a handkerchief sticking out of his breast pocket, which was
tremendously sophisticated and dashing for a provincial town like
Jinzhou.  He was enrolled in a university in Peking, where he was
reading Russian language and literature.  My mother was very impressed
with him, and his family approved of her.  They soon sent a go-between
to Dr.  Xia to ask for her hand, without, of course, saying a word to
her.

Dr.  Xia was more liberal than most men of his time, and asked my
mother how she felt about the matter.  She agreed to be a 'friend' to
young Mr.  Liu.  At that time, if a boy and a girl were seen talking to
each other in public, they had to be engaged, at the minimum.  My
mother was longing to have some fun and freedom, and to be able to make
friends with men without committing herself to marriage.

Dr.  Xia and my grandmother, knowing my mother, were cautious with the
Lius, and declined all the customary presents.  In the Chinese
tradition, a woman's family often did not consent to a marriage
proposal immediately,-as they should not appear too keen.  If they
accepted presents, this implicitly indicated consent.  Dr.  Xia and my
grandmother were worried about a misunderstanding.

x xo "Slaves Who Have No Country of Your Own'

My mother went out with young Liu for a while.  She was rather taken
with his urbanity, and all her relatives, friends, and neighbors said
she had made a good match.  Dr.  Xia and my grandmother thought they
were a handsome couple, and had privately settled on him as their
son-inlaw.  But my mother felt he was shallow.  She noticed that he
never went to Peking, but lounged around at home enjoying the life of a
dilettante.  One day she discovered he had not even read The Dream of
the Red Chamber, the famous eighteenth-century Chinese classic, with
which every literate Chinese was familiar.  When she showed how
disappointed she felt, young Liu said airily that the Chinese classics
were not his forte, and that what he actually liked most was foreign
literature.  To try to reassert his superiority, he added: "Now, have
you read Madame Bovary?  That's my all-time favorite.  I consider it
the greatest of Maupassant's works."

My mother had read Madame Bovary and she knew it was by Flaubert, not
Maupassant.  This vain sally put her off Liu in a big way, but she
refrained from confronting him there and then to do so would have been
considered 'shrewish."

Liu loved gambling, particularly mahjongg, which bored my mother to
death.  One evening soon afterward, in the middle of a game, a female
servant came in and asked: "Which maid would Master Liu like to serve
him in bed?"  In a very casual way, Liu said "So-and-so."  My mother
was shaking with anger, but all Liu did was to raise his eyebrow as
though he was surprised at her reaction.

Then he said in a supercilious way: "This is a perfectly common custom
in Japan.  Everybody does it.  It's called si-qin ("bed with
service")."  He was trying to make my mother feel she was being
provincial and jealous, which was traditionally regarded in China as
one of the worst vices in a woman, and grounds for a husband to disown
his wife.  Once again my mother said nothing, even though she was
boiling with rage inside.

My mother decided she could not be
happy with a husband who regarded flirtations and extramarital sex as
essential aspects of 'being a man."  She wanted someone who loved her,
who would not want to hurt her by doing this sort of thing.  That
evening she made up her mind to end the relationship.

A few days later Mr.  Liu senior suddenly died.  In those days a
spectacular funeral was very important, particularly if the dead person
had been the head of the family.  A funeral which failed to meet the
expectations of the relatives and of society would bring disapproval on
the family.

The Lius wanted an elaborate ceremony, not simply a procession from the
house to the cemetery.  Monks were brought in to read the Buddhist
sutra of' putting the head down' in the presence of the whole family.
Immediately after this, the family members burst out crying.  From then
to the day of the burial, on the forty-ninth day after the death, the
sound of weeping and wailing was supposed to be heard nonstop from
early morning until midnight, accompanied by the constant burning of
artificial money for the deceased to use in the other world.  Many
families could not keep up this marathon, and hired professionals to do
the job for them.  The Lius were too filial to do this, and did all the
keening themselves, with the help of relatives, of whom there were
many.

On the forty-second day after his death, the corpse which had been put
in a beautifully carved sandalwood coffin was placed in a marquee in
the courtyard.  On each of the last seven nights before his interment
the dead man was supposed to ascend a high mountain in the other world
and look down on his whole family; he would only be happy if he saw
that every member of his family was present and taken care of.
Otherwise, it was believed, he would never find rest.  The family
wanted my mother to be there as the intended daughter-in-law.

She refused.  She felt sad for old Mr.  Liu, who had been kind to her,
but if she attended, she would never be able to get out of marrying his
son.  Relays of messengers from the Liu family came to the Xia house.

Dr.  Xia told my mother that breaking her relationship at this moment
was tantamount to letting Mr.  Liu senior down, and that this was
dishonorable.  Although he would not have objected to my mother
breaking up with young Mr.  Liu normally, he felt that under the
circumstances her wishes should be subordinated to a higher imperative.
My grandmother also thought she should go.  In addition she said, "Who
ever heard of a girl rejecting a man because he got the name of some
foreign writer wrong, or because he had affairs?  All rich young men
like to have fun and sow their wild oats.  Besides, you have no need to
worry about concubines and maids.  You're a strong character; you can
keep your husband under control."

This was not my mother's idea of the life she wanted, and she said so.
In her heart, my grandmother agreed.  But she was frightened about
keeping my mother at home because of the persistent proposals from
Kuomintang officers, "We can say no to one, but not to all of them,"
she told my mother.

"If you don't marry Zhang, you will have to accept Lee.

Think it over: isn't Liu much better than the others?  If you marry
him, no officer will be able to bother you anymore.  I worry day and
night about what may happen to you.  I won't be able to rest until you
leave the house."  But my mother said she would rather die than marry
someone who could not give her happiness and love.

The Lius were furious with my mother, and so were Dr.  Xia' and my
grandmother.  For days they argued, pleaded, cajoled, shouted, and
wept, to no avail.  Finally, for the first time since he had hit her as
a child for sitting in his seat on the kang, Dr.  Xia flew into a rage
with my mother.

"What you are doing is bringing shame on the name of Xia.  I don't want
a daughter like you!"  My mother stood up and flung back the words:
"All right, then, you won't have a daughter like me.  I'm leaving!" She
stormed out of the room, packed her things, and left the house.

Ruled by Different Masters I 13 In my grandmother's time, leaving home
like this would have been out of the question.  There were no jobs for
women, except as servants, and even they had to have references.  But
things had changed.  In 1946 women could live on their own and find
work, like teaching or medicine, although working was still regarded as
the last resort by most families.  In my mother's school was a teacher
training depariment which offered free board and tuition for girls who
had completed three years in the school.  Apart from an exam, the only
condition for entry was that the graduates had to become teachers. Most
pupils in the depa,uuent were either from poor families who could not
afford to pay for an education or people who did not think they had a
chance to get into a university, and therefore did not want to stay on
at the normal high school.  It was only since 1945 that women could
contemplate getting into a universiF; under the Japanese, they could
not go beyond high school, where they were mainly taught how to run a
family.

Up till now my mother had never considered going to this department,
which was generally looked down on as second best.  She had always
thought of herself as university material.  The depariment was a lit He
surprised when she applied, but she persuaded them of her fervent wish
to join the teaching profession.  She had not yet finished her
obligatory three years in the school, but she was known as a star
pupil.  The depa~uuent gladly took her after giving her an exam which
she passed with little difficulty.  She went to live in the school.  It
was not long before my grandmother rushed over to beg her to come home.
My mother was glad to have a reconciliation; she promised she would go
home and stay often.  But she insisted on keeping her bed on the
campus; she was determined not to be dependent on anyone, however much
they loved her.  For her, the deparunent was ideal.  It guaranteed her
a job after graduation, whereas university graduates often could not
find jobs.  Another advantage was that it was free and

Dr.  Xia was already beginning to suffer the effects of the
mismanagement of the economy.

The Kuomintang personnel put in charge of the factories those that had
not been dismantled by the Russians were conspicuously unsuccessful at
getting the economy moving again.  They got a few factories working at
well below full capacity, but pocketed most of the revenue
themselves.

Kuomintang carpetbaggers were moving into the smart houses which the
Japanese had vacated.  The house next door to the Xias' old house,
where the Japanese official had lived, was now occupied by an official
and one of his newly acquired concubines.  The mayor ofJinzhou, a Mr.
Han, was a local nobody.  Suddenly he was rich from the proceeds of
property confiscated from the Japanese and collaborators.  He acquired
several concubines, and the locals began to call the city government
'the Han household," as it was bulging with his relatives and
friends.

When the Kuomintang took Yixian they released my great-grandfather,
Yang, from prison or he bought his way out.  The locals believed, with
good reason, that Kuomintang officials made fortunes out of the
ex-collaborators.

Yang tried to protect himself by marrying off his remaining daughter,
whom he had had with one of his concubines, to a Kuomintang officer.
But this man was only a captain, not powerful enough to give him any
real protection.

Yang's property was confiscated and he was reduced to living as a
beggar 'squatting by open drains," as the locals called it.  When she
heard about this, his wife told-her children not to give him any money
or do anything to help him.

In 1947, a little more than a year after his release from jail, he
developed a cancerous goiter on his neck.  He realized he was dying and
sent word to Jinzhou begging to see his children.  My great-grandmother
refused, but he kept sending messages entreating them to come.  In the
end his wife relented.  My grandmother, Lan and Yu-lin set off for
Yixian by train.  It was ten years
since my grandmother had seen her father, and he was a crumpled shadow
of his former self.  Tears streamed down his cheeks when he saw his
children.  They found it hard to forgive him for the way he had treated
their mother and themselves and they spoke to him using rather distant
forms of address.  He pleaded with Yu-lin to call him Father, but
Yu-lin refused.

Yang's ravaged face was a mask of despair.  My grandmother begged her
brother to call him Father, just once.

Finally he did, through gritted teeth.  His father took his hand and
said: "Try to be a scholar, or run a small business.

Never try to be an official.  It will ruin you, the way it has ruined
me."  These were his last words to his family.

He died with only one of his concubines at his side.  He was so poor he
could not even afford a coffin.  His corpse was put in a battered old
suitcase and buried without ceremony.  Not one member of his family was
there.

Corruption was so widespread that Chiang Kai-shek set up a special
organization to combat it.  It was called the "Tiger-Beating Squad,"
because people compared corrupt officials to fearsome tigers, and it
invited citizens to send in their complaints.  But it soon became
apparent that this was a means for the really powerful to extort money
from the rich.

"Tiger-beating' was a lucrative job.

Much worse than this was the blatant looting.  Dr.  Xia was visited
every now and then by soldiers who would salute punctiliously and then
say in an exaggeratedly cringing voice: "Your honor Dr.  Xia, some of
our colleagues are very short of money.  Could you perhaps lend us
some?"  It was unwise to refuse.  Anyone who crossed the Kuomintang was
likely to be accused of being a Communist, which usually meant arrest,
and frequently torture.  Soldiers would also swagger into the surgery
and demand treatment and medicine without paying a penny.  Dr.  Xia did
not particularly mind giving them free medical treatment he regarded it
as a doctor's duty to treat anyone but the
soldiers would sometimes just take the medicine
without asking, and sell it on the black market.  Medicines were in
desperately short supply.

As the civil war intensified the number of soldiers in Jinzhou rose.
The troops of the central command, which came directly under Chiang
Kai-shek, were relatively well disciplined, but the others received no
pay from the central government and had to 'live off the land."

At the teacher training department my mother struck up a close
friendship with a beautiful, vivacious seventeen year-old girl called
Bai.  My mother admired her and looked up to her.  When she told Bai
about her disenchantment with the Kuomintang, Bai told her to 'look at
the forest, not the individual trees': any force was bound to have some
shortcomings, she said.  Bai was passionately pro-Kuomintang, so much
so that she had joined one of the intelligence services.  In a training
course it was made clear to her that she was expected to report on her
fellow students.  She refused.  A few nights later her colleagues in
the course heard a shot from her bedroom.  When they opened the door,
they saw her lying on her bed, gasping, her face deathly white.  There
was blood on her pillow.  She died without being able to say a word.
The newspapers published the story as what was called a 'peach-colored
case," meaning a crime of passion.  They claimed she had been murdered
by a jealous lover.  But nobody believed this.  Bai had behaved in a
very demure manner where men were concerned.  My mother heard that she
had been killed because she had tried to pull out.

The tragedy did not end there.  Bai's mother was working as a live-in
servant in the house of a wealthy family which owned a small gold shop.
She was heartbroken at the death of her only daughter, and incensed by
the scurrilous suggestions in the papers that her daughter had had
several lovers who had fought over her and eventually killed her.

A woman's most sacred possession was her chastity, which she was
supposed to defend to the death.  Several days after
Bai's death, her mother hanged
herself.  Her employer was visited by thugs who accused him of being
responsible for her death.  It was a good pretext to extort money, and
it did not take long for the man to lose his gold shop.  One day there
was a knock on the Xias' door and a man in his late thirties, dressed
in Kuomintang uniform, came in and bowed to my grandmother, addressing
her as 'elder sister' and Dr.  Xia as 'elder brother-in-law."  It took
them a moment to realize that this smartly dressed, healthy, well fed
man was Han-chen, who had been tortured and saved from the garrote, and
whom they had hidden in their old house for three months and nursed
back to health.  With him, also in uniform, was a tall, slender young
man who looked more like a college student than a soldier.  Hanchen
introduced him as his friend Zhu-ge.  My mother immediately took to
him.

Since their last encounter Han-chen had become a senior official in
Kuomintang intelligence, and was in charge of one of its branches for
the whole of Jinzhou.  As he left, he said: "Elder sister, I was given
back my life by your family.  If you ever need anything, anything at
all, all you have to do is say the word and it will be done."

Han-chen and Zhu-ge came to visit often, and Hanchen soon found jobs in
the intelligence apparatus for both Dong, the former executioner who
had saved his life, and my grandmother's brother-in-law Pei-o, the
former prison warder.

Zhu-ge became very friendly with the family.  He had been studying
science at university in Tianjin and had fled to join the Kuomintang
when the city had fallen into Japanese hands.  On one of his visits my
mother introduced him to Miss Tanaka, who had been living with the
Xias.

They hit it off, got married, and went to live in rented rooms.  One
day Zhu-ge was cleaning his gun when he accidentally touched the
trigger and the gun went off.  The bullet passed straight through the
floor and killed the landlord's youngest son, who was in bed
downstairs.  The family did not dare to bring a charge against Zhu-ge
because they were frightened of intelligence men, who could accuse
anyone they chose to of being a Communist.  Their word was law, and
they had the power of life and death.  Zhu-ge's mother gave the family
a large sum of money as compensation.  Zhu-ge was distraught, but the
family did not even dare show any anger toward him.  Instead, they
showed exaggerated gratitude, out of fear that he might anticipate that
they would be angry, and harm them.  He found this hard to bear, and
soon moved out.

Lan's husband, Uncle Pei-o, prospered in the intelligence system and
was so delighted with his new employers that he changed his name to
"Xiao-shek' ("Loyalty to Chiang Kai-shek').  He was a member of a
three-man group under Zhu-ge.  Initially their job was to purge anyone
who had been pro-Japanese, but very soon this slid into watching out
for students showing pro-Communist sympathies.  For a while, "Loyalty'
Pei-o did what was asked of him, but his conscience soon began to
trouble him; he did not want to be responsible for sending people to
prison or choosing victims for extortion.  He asked for a transfer and
was given a job as a watchman at one of the city checi/points.  The
Communists had left the city of Jinzhou but had not gone very far. They
were engaged in constant battles with the Kuomintang in the surrounding
countryside.  The Jinzhou authorities were trying to keep. tight
control over the most vital commodities to stop the Communists from
getting hold of them.

Being in intelligence gave "Loyalty' power, which brought him money.
Gradually he began to change.  He started smoking opium, drinking
heavily, gambling, and frequenting brothels, and soon contracted a
venereal disease.  My grandmother offered him money to try to get him
to behave, but he carried on as before.  However, he could see that
food was becoming increasingly scarce for the Xias, and often invited
them to good meals at his house.  Dr.  Xia would not let my grandmother
go.

"Those are ill-gotten

Ruled by Different Masters l 19 gains and we don't want to touch them,"
he said.  But the thought of some decent food was sometimes too strong
a temptation for my grandmother and occasionally she would sneak off to
the Pei-o house with Yu-lin and my mother for a square meal.

When the Kuomintang first came to Jinzhou Yu-lin was fifteen years old.
He had been studying medicine with Dr.  Xia, who thought he had a
promising future as a doctor.

By now my grandmother had taken on the position of the female head of
the family as her mother, sister, and brother were all dependent on her
husband for a living, and she felt it was time Yu-lin got married.  She
soon settled on a woman who was three years older than him and came
from a poor family, which meant she would be hard-working and capable.
My mother went with my grandmother to see the prospective bride; when
she came in to bow to the visitors in the sitting room, she was wearing
a green velvet gown which she had had to borrow for the occasion.  The
couple were married in a registry office in 1946, the bride wearing a
rented Western-style white silk veil.  Yu-lin was sixteen and his wife
was nineteen.

My grandmother asked Han-chen to find Yu-lin a job.

One of the vital commodities was salt, and the authorities had
forbidden selling it to the countryside.  Of course, they were running
a salt racket themselves.  Han-chen got Yulin a job as a salt guard,
and several times he was almost involved in serious skirmishes with
Communist guerrillas and other Kuomintang factions who were trying to
capture the salt.  Many people were being killed in the fighting.

Yu-lin found the job frightening, and was also tormented by his
conscience.  Within a few months he quit.

By this time, the Kuomintang was gradually losing control of the
countryside, and was finding it harder and harder to get recruits.
Young men were increasingly unwilling to become 'bomb ashes' (pao-hul).
The civil war had become much more bloody, with enormous casualties,
and the danger of being conscripted or simply impressed into the army
was growing.  The
only way to keep Yu-lin out of uniform was to buy him some form of
insurance, so my grandmother asked Han-chen to find him a job in
intelligence.  To her surprise, he refused, telling her it was no place
for a decent young man.

My grandmother did not realize that Han-chen was in deep despair about
his work.  Like "Loyalty' Pei-o he had become an opium addict, and was
drinking heavily and visiting prostitutes.  He was visibly wasting
away.  Han-chen had always been a self-disciplined man, with a strong
sense of morality, and it was most unlike him to let himself go in this
way.  My grandmother thought that the ancient remedy of marriage might
pull him around, but when she put this to him he said he could not take
a wife, because he did not want to live.  My grandmotfier was shocked,
and pressed him to tell her why, but Han-chen only started weeping and
said bitterly that he was not free to tell her, and that she could not
help anyway.

Han-chen had joined the Kuomintang because he hated the Japanese.  But
things had turned out differently from what he had envisaged.  Being
involved in the intelligence system meant that he could hardly avoid
having innocent blood of his' fellow Chinese on his hands.  But he
could not get out.  What had happened to my mother's college friend Bai
was what happened to anyone who tried to quit.

Han-chen probably felt that the only way out was to kill himself, but
suicide was a traditional gesture of protest and might bring trouble to
his family.  Han-chen must have come to the conclusion that the only
thing he could do was to die a 'natural' death, which was why he was
going to such wild extremes in abusing his body and why he refused to
take any treatment.

On the eve of Chinese New Year 1947 he returned to his family home in
Yixian to spend the festival period with his brother and his elderly
father.  As if he felt that this was to be their last meeting, he
stayed on.  He fell gravely ill, and died in the summer.  He had told
my grandmother that the only regret he would have in dying was not
being able to fulfill his filial duty and hold a grand funeral for his
father.

But he did not die without fulfilling his obligation to my grandmother
and her family.  Even though he refused to take Yu-lin into
intelligence work, he acquired an identity card for him which said he
was a Kuomintang intelligence official.  Yu-lin never did any work for
the intelligence system, but his membership guaranteed him against
being conscripted, and he was able to stay and help Dr.  Xia in the
medicine shop.

One of the teachers at my mother's school was a young man named Kang,
who taught Chinese literature.  He was very bright and knowledgeable,
and my mother respected him tremendously.  He told her.  and some other
girls that he had been involved in anti-Kuomintang activities in the
city of Kunming in southwest China, and that his girlfriend had been
killed by a hand grenade during a demonstration.

His lectures were clearly pro-Communist, and made a strong impression
on my mother.

One morning in early 1947 my mother was stopped at the school gate by
the old porter.  He handed her a note and told her that Kang had gone.
What my mother did not know was that Kang had been tipped off, as some
of the Kuomintang intelligence agents were secretly working for the
Communists.  At the time my mother did not know much about the
Communists, or that Kang was one of them.  All she knew was that the
teacher she most admired had had to flee because he was about to be
arrested.

The note was from Kang, and consisted of only one word: "Silence."  My
mother saw two possible meanings in this word.  It could refer to a
line from a poem Kang had written in memory of his girlfriend, "Silence
in which our strength is gathering," in which case it might be an
appeal not to lose heart.  But the note could also be a warning against
doing something impetuous.  My mother had by then established quite a
reputation for fearlessness, and she commanded support among the
students.  The next thing she knew a new headmistress arrived.  She was
a delegate to the National Congress of the Kuomintang, reputedly with
ties to the secret services.  She brought with her a number of
intelligence men, including one called Yao-han, who became the
political supervisor, with the special task of keeping a watch on the
students.

The academic supervisor was the district party secretary of the
Kuomintang.

My mother's closest friend at this time was a distant male cousin
called Hu.  His father owned a chain of department stores in Jinzhou,
Mukden, and Harbin, and had a wife and two concubines.  His wife had
produced a son, Cousin Hu, while the concubines had not.  Cousin Hu's
mother therefore became the object of intense jealousy on their part.
One night when her husband was out of the house the concubines drugged
her food and that of a young male servant, then put them into the same
bed.  When Mr.  Hu came back and found his wife, apparently blind
drunk, in bed with the servant, he went berserk; he locked his wife up
in a tiny room in a remote corner of the house, and forbade his son to
see her again.  He had a sneaking suspicion that the whole thing might
have been a plot by his concubines, so he did not disown his wife and
throw her out, which would have been the ultimate disgrace (to himself
as well as to her).  He was worried that the concubines might harm his
son, so he sent him away to boarding school in Jinzhou, which is how my
mother met him, when she was seven and he was twelve.  His mother soon
went mad in her solitary confinement.

Cousin Hu grew up to be a sensitive boy who kept to himself.  He never
got over what had happened, and occasionally talked to my mother about
it.  The story made my mother reflect on the blighted lives of women in
her own family and on the numerous tragedies that had happened to so
many other mothers, daughters, wives, and concubines.  The
powerlessness of women, the barbarity of the age-old customs, cloaked
in 'tradition' and even 'morality," enraged her.  Although there had
been changes, they were buried by the still overwhelming prejudice.  My
mother was impatient for something more radical.

In her school she learned that one political force had openly promised
change the Communists.  The information came from a close friend of
hers, an eighteen-year old girl called Shu who had broken with her
family and was staying in the school because her father had tried to
force her into an arranged marriage with a boy of twelve.

One day Shu bade farewell to my mother: she and the man she was
secretly in love with were running away to join the Communists.

"They are our hope," were her parting words.

It was about this time that my mother became very close to Cousin Hu,
who had realized that he was in love with her when he found that he was
very jealous of young Mr.  Liu, whom he regarded as a dandy.  He was
delighted when she broke up with Liu, and came to see my mother almost
every day.

One evening in March 1947 they went to the cinema together.  There were
two kinds of tickets: one for a seat;

the other, which was much cheaper, for standing only.

Cousin Hu bought my mother a seat, but a standing ticket for himself,
saying he did not have enough money on him.

My mother thought this was a bit odd, and so she stole a glance in his
direction every now and then.  Halfway through the film she saw a
smartly dressed young woman approach him, slide by him slowly, and
then, for a split second, their hands touched.  She got up at once and
insisted on leaving.  When they got outside she demanded an
explanation.  At first Cousin Hu tried to deny that anything had
happened; when my mother made it clear she was not going to swallow
this, he said he would explain later.  There were things my mother
could not understand, he said, because she was too young.  When they
reached her house, she
refused to let him in.  Over the next few days he called repeatedly,
but my mother would not see him.

After a while, she was ready for an apology and a reconciliation, and
would keep looking out toward the gate to see if he was there.  One
evening, when it was snowing hard, she saw him coming into the
courtyard accompanied by another man.  He did not make for her part of
the house, but went straight to where the Xias' tenant, a man called
Yu-wu, was living.  After a short time Hu reemerged and walked briskly
over to her room.  With an urgent edge to his voice, he told her he had
to leave Jinzhou immediately, as the police were after him.  When she
asked him why, all he said was, "I am a Communist," and disappeared
into the snowy night.

It dawned on my mother that the incident in the cinema must have been a
clandestine mission of Cousin Hu's.  She was heartbroken, as there was
now no time to make up with him.  She realized that their tenant,
Yu-wu, must also be an underground Communist.  The reason Cousin Hu had
been brought to Yu-wu's quarters was to hide there.

Cousin Hu and Yu-wu had not known each other's identity until this
evening.  Both of them realized it was out of the question for Cousin
Hu to stay there, as his relationship with my mother was too well
known, and if the Kuomintang came to the house to look for him Yu-wu
would be discovered as well.  That same night Cousin Hu tried to make
for the Communist-controlled area, which lay about twenty miles beyond
the city boundaries.  Some time later, as the first buds of spring were
bursting out, Yu-wu received news that Hu had been captured as he left
the city.  His escort had been shot dead.  A later report said Hu had
been executed.

My mother had been turning more and more strongly against the
Kuomintang for some time.  The only alternative she knew was the
Communists, and she had been particularly attracted by their promises
to put an end to
injustices against women.  Up to now,
at the age of fifteen, she had not felt ready to commit herself fully.
The news of Cousin Hu's death made her mind up.  She decided to join
the Communists.

5. "Daughter for Sale for 10 Kilos of Rice'

In Battle for a New China

(1947-1948)

Yu-wu had first appeared at the house some months earlier bearing an
introduction from a mutual friend.  The Xias had just moved from their
borrowed residence into a big house inside the walls near the north
gate, and had been looking for a rich tenant to help with the rent.
Yu-wu arrived wearing the uniform of a Kuomintang officer, accompanied
by a woman whom he presented as his wife and a young baby.  In fact,
the woman was not his wife but his assistant.  The baby was hers, and
her real husband was somewhere far away in the regular Communist
army.

Gradually this 'family' became a real one.  They later had two children
together and their original spouses remarried.

Yu-wu had joined the Communist Party in 1938.  He had been sent to
Jinzhou from the Communists' wartime headquarters, Yan'an, shortly
after the Japanese surrender, and was responsible for collecting and
delivering informarion to the Communist forces outside the city.  He
operated under the identity of a Kuomintang military bureau chief for
one of the districts of Jinzhou, a position the Communists had bought
for him.  At the time, posts in the Kuomintang, even in the
intelligence system, were virtually

In Battle ybr a New China 127 for sale to the highest bidder.  Some
people bought posts to protect their families from being forced into
the army and from harassment by thugs, others to be able to extort
money.  Because of its strategic importance, there were a great many
officers in Jinzhou, which facilitated the Como munist infiltration of
the system.

Yu-wu played his part to perfection.  He gave a lot of gambling and
dinner parties, par fly to make connections and partly to weave a
protective web around himself.

Mingled with the constant comings and goings of Kuomintang officers and
intelligence officials was an unending stream of 'cousins' and
'friends."  They were always different people, but nobody asked any
questions.

Yu-wu had another layer of cover for these frequent visitors.  Dr.
Xia's surgery was always open, and Yu-wu's 'friends' could walk in off
the street without attracting attention, and then go through the
surgery to the inner courtyard.  Dr.  Xia tolerated Yu-wu's rowdy
parties without demur, even though his sect, the Society of Reason,
forbade gambling and drinking.  My mother was puzzled, but put it down
to her stepfather's tolerant nature.  It was only years later when she
thought back that she felt certain that Dr.  Xia had known, or guessed,
Yu-wu's real identity.

When my mother heard that her cousin Hu had been killed by the
Kuomintang she approached Yu-wu about working for the Communists.  He
turned her down, on the grounds that she was too young.

My mother had become quite prominent at her school and she was hoping
that the Communists would approach her.  They did, but they took their
time checking her out.

In fact, before leaving for the Communist-controlled area, her friend
Shu had told her own Communist contact about my mother, and had
introduced him to her as 'a friend'.

One day, this man came to her and told her out of the blue to go on a
certain day to a railway tunnel halfway between the Jinzhou south
station and the north station.

128 "Daughter JSr Sale Jbr i o Kilos of Rice' There, he said, a
good-looking man in his mid-twenties with a Shanghai accent would
contact her.  This man, whose name she later discovered was Liang,
became her controller.

Her first job was to distribute literature like Mao Zedong's On
Coalition Government, and pamphlets on land reform and other Communist
policies.  These had to be smuggled into the city, usually hidden in
big bundles of sorghum stalks which were to be used for fuel.  The
pamphlets were then repacked, often rolled up inside big green
peppers.

Sometimes Yu-lin's wife would buy the peppers and keep a lookout in the
street when my mother's associates came to collect the literature.  She
also helped hide the pamphlets in the ashes of various stoves, heaps of
Chinese medicines, or piles of fuel.  The students had to read this
literature in secret, though left-wing novels could be read more or
less openly: among the favorites was Maksim Gorky's Mother.

One day a copy of one of the pamphlets my mother had been distributing,
Mao's On New Democracy, ended up with a rather absent-minded
schoolfriend of hers, who put it in her bag and forgot about it.  When
she went to the market she opened her bag to get some money and the
pamphlet dropped out.  Two intelligence men happened to be there and
identified it from its flimsy yellow paper.  The girl was taken off and
interrogated.  She died under torture.

Many people had died at the hands of Kuomintang intelligence, and my
mother knew that she risked torture if she was caught.  This incident,
far from daunting her, only made her feel more defiant.  Her morale was
also boosted enormously by the fact that she now felt herself pan of
the Communist movement.

Manchuria was the key battleground in the civil war, and what happened
in Jinzhou was becoming more and more critical to the outcome of the
whole struggle for China.  There was no fixed front, in the sense of a
single

In Battle For a New China i 2~ battle line.  The Communists held the
northern part of Manchuria and much of the countryside; the Kuomintang
held the main cities, except for Harbin in the north, plus the seaports
and most of the railway lines.  By the end of 1947, for the first time,
the Communist armies in the area outnumbered those of their opponents;
during that year they had put over 300,000 Kuomintang troops out of
action.  Many peasants were joining the Communist army, or swinging
their support behind the Communists.  The single most important reason
was that the Communists had carried out a land-to-the-filler reform and
the peasants felt that backing them was the way to keep their land.

At the time the Communists controlled much of the area around Jinzhou.
Peasants were reluctant to enter the city to sell their produce because
they had to go through Kuomintang checkpoints where they were harassed:
exorbitant fees were extorted, or they simply had their products
confiscated.  The grain price in the city was rocketing upwards almost
day by day, made worse by the manipulation of greedy merchants and
corrupt officials.

When the Kuomintang first arrived, they had issued a new currency known
as the "Law money."  But they proved unable to control inflation.  Dr.
Xia had always been worried about what would happen to my grandmother
and my mother when he died and he was now nearly eighty.  He had been
putting his savings into the new money because he had faith in the
government.  After a time the Law money was replaced by another
currency, the Golden Yuan, which soon became worth so little that when
my mother wanted to pay her school fees she had to hire a rickshaw to
carry the huge pile of notes (to 'save face' Chiang Kai-shek refused to
print any note bigger than 10,000 yuan).  Dr.  Xia's entire savings
were gone.

The economic situation deteriorated steadily through the winter of
1947-48.  Protests against food shortages and price gouging multiplied.
Jinzhou was the key supply base for the large Kuomintang armies farther
north, and in x3o "Daughter for Sale Jbr I o Kilos of Rice'
mid-December 1947 a crowd of 20,000 people raided two well-stocked
grain stores.

One trade was prospering: trafficking in young girls for brothels and
as slave-servants to rich men.  The city was littered with beggars
offering their children in exchange for food.  For days outside her
school my mother saw an emaciated, desperate-looking woman in rags
slumped on the frozen ground.  Next to her stood a girl of about ten
with an expression of numb misery on her face.  A sack was poking up
out of the back of her collar and on it was a poorly written sign
saying "Daughter for sale for io kilos of rice."

Among those who could not make ends meet were the teachers.  They had
been demanding a pay rise, to which the government responded by
increasing tuition fees.  This had lit He effect, because the parents
could not afford to pay more.  A teacher at my mother's school died of
food poisoning after eating a piece of meat he had picked up off the
street.  He knew the meat was rotten, but he was so hungry he thought
he would take a chance.

By now my mother had become the president of the students' union.  Her
Party controller, Liang, had given her instructions to try to win over
the teachers as well as the students, and she set about organizing a
campaign to get people to donate money for the teaching staff.  She and
some other girls would go to cinemas and theaters and before the
performances started they would appeal for donations.  They also put on
song-and-dance shows and ran rummage sales, but the returns were paltry
people were either too poor or too mean.

One day she bumped into a friend of hers who was the granddaughter of a
brigade commander and was married to a Kuomintang officer.  The friend
told her there was going to be a banquet that evening for about fifty
officers and their wives in a smart restaurant in town.  In those days
there was a lot of entertaining going on among Kuomintang officials. My
mother raced off to her school and contacted as many people as she
could.  She told them to gather at 5 p.m. in front of the city's most
prominent landmark, the sixty-foot-high eleventh-century stone drum
tower.  When she got there, at the head of a sizable contingent, there
were over a hundred girls waiting for her orders.  She told them her
plan.  At around six o'clock they saw large numbers of officers
arriving in carriages and rickshaws.

The women were dressed to the nines, wearing silk and satin and
jingling with jewelry.

When my mother judged that the diners would be well into their food and
drink, she and some of the girls filed into the restaurant.  Kuomintang
decadence was such that security was unbelievably lax.  My mother
climbed onto a chair, her simple dark-blue cotton gown making her the
image of austerity among the brightly, embroidered silks and jewels.
She made a brief speech about how hard up the teachers were, and
finished with the words: "We all know you are generous people.  You
must be very pleased to have this opportunity to open your pockets and
show your generosity."

The officers were in a spot.  None of them wanted to look mean.  In
fact, they more or less had to try to show off.

And, of course, they wanted to get rid of the unwelcome intruders.  The
girls went round the heavily laden tables and made a note of each
officer's contribution.  Then, first thing next morning, they went
round to the officers' homes and collected their pledges.  The teachers
were enormously grateful to the girls, who delivered the money to them
right away, so it could be used before its value was wiped out, which
would be within hours.

There was no retribution against my mother, perhaps because the diners
were ashamed of being caught like this, and did not want to bring
further embarrassment on themselves although, of course, the whole town
knew about it at once.  My mother had successfully turned the rules of
the game against them.  She was appalled by the casual extravagance of
the Kuomintang elite while people were
starving to death in the streets and this made her even more
committed to the Communists.

As food was the problem inside the city, so clothing was in desperately
short supply outside, as the Kuomintang had placed a ban on selling
textiles to the countryside.  As a watchman on the gates, "Loyalty'
Pei-o's main job was to stop textiles being smuggled out of the city
and sold to the Communists.  The smugglers were a mixture of black
marketeers, men working for Kuomintang officials, and underground
Communists.

The usual procedure was that "Loyalty' and his colleagues would stop
the carts and confiscate the cloth, then release the smuggler in the
hope that he would come back with another load which they could also
seize.  Sometimes they had a deal with the smugglers for a
percentage.

Whether they had a deal or not, the guards would sell the cloth to the
Communist-controlled areas anyway.

"Loyalty' and his colleagues waxed fat.

One night a dirty, nondescript cart rolled up at the gate where
"Loyalty' was on duty.  He performed his customary charade, poking the
pile of cloth on the back while he swaggered around, hoping to
intimidate the driver and soften him up for an advantageous deal.  As
he sized up the value of the load and the likely resistance of the
driver, he was also hoping to engage him in conversation and find out
who his employer was.

"Loyalty' took his time because this was a big consignment, more than
he could get out of the city before dawn.

He got up beside the driver and ordered him to turn around and take the
consignment back into the city.  The driver, accustomed to being on the
receiving end of ~irbitrary instructions, did as he was told.

My grandmother was sound asleep in bed when she heard banging on the
door at about 1 a.m. When she opened it, she found "Loyalty' standing
there.  He said he wanted to leave the cartload at the house for the
night.  My grandmother had to agree, because the Chinese tradition made
it virtually impossible to say no to a relation.  The obligation to
one's family and relatives always took precedence over one's own moral
judgment.  She did not tell Dr.  Xia, who was still asleep.

Well before daybreak "Loyalty' reappeared with two cans; he transferred
the consignment onto them and drove off just as dawn was beginning to
light up the sky.  Less than half an hour later armed police appeared
and cordoned off the house.  The cart driver, who had been working for
another intelligence system, had informed his patrons.

Naturally, they wanted their merchandise back.

Dr.  Xia and my grandmother were quite put out, but at least the goods
had disappeared.  For my mother, though, the raid was almost a
catastrophe.  She had some Communist leaflets hidden in the house, and
as soon as the police appeared, she grabbed the leaflets and raced to
the toilet, where she pushed them down her padded trousers which were
tightened round the ankles to conserve heat, and put on a heavy winter
coat.  Then she sauntered out as nonchalantly as she could, pretending
she was on her way to school.  The policemen stopped her and said they
were going to search her.  She screamed at them that she would tell her
"Uncle' Zhu-ge how they had treated her.

Up to that moment the policemen had had no idea about the family's
intelligence connections.  Nor had they any idea who had confiscated
the textiles.  The administration of Jinzhou was in utter confusion
because of the enormous number of different Kuomintang units stationed
in the city and because anyone with a gun and some sort of protection
enjoyed arbitrary power.  When "Loyalty' and his men had appropriated
this load the driver did not ask them who they were working for.

The moment my mother mentioned Zhu-ge's name, there was a change in the
attitude of the officer.  Zhu-ge was a friend of his boss.  At a
signal, his subordinates lowered their guns and dropped their
insolently challenging manner.  The officer bowed stiffly and muttered
profuse apologies for
disturbing such an august family.  The rank and-file police looked even
more disappointed than their commander no booty meant no money, and no
money meant no food.  They shambled off sullenly, dragging their feet
as they went.

At the time there was a new university, the Northeast Exile University,
in Jinzhou, formed around students and teachers who had fled
Communist-occupied northern Manchuria.  Communist policies there had
often been harsh: many landowners had been killed.  In the towns, even
small factory owners and shopkeepers were denounced and their property
was confiscated.  Most intellectuals came from relatively well-to-do
families, and many had seen their families suffer under Communist rule
or been denounced themselves.

There was a medical college in the Exile University, and my mother
wanted to get into it.  It had always been her ambition to be a doctor.
This was partly Dr.  Xia's influence and partly because the medical
profession offered a woman the best chance of independence.  Liang
endorsed the idea enthusiastically.  The Party had plans for her.  She
enrolled in the medical college on a part-time basis in February
1948.

The Exile University was a battleground where the Kuomintang and the
Communists competed fiercely for influence.  The Kuomintang could see
how badly it was doing in Manchufig and was actively encouraging
students and intellectuals to flee farther south.  The Communists did
not want to lose these educated people.  They modified their land
reform program, and issued an order that urban capitalists were to be
well treated and intellectuals from well to-do families protected.
Armed with these more moderate policies, the Jinzhou underground set
out to persuade the students and teachers to stay on.  This became my
mother's main activity.

In spite of the Communists' policy switch, some students and teachers
decided it was safer to flee.  One shipload of students sailed to the
city of Tianjin, about 25o miles to the southwest, at the end of June.
When they arrived there they found that there was no food and nowhere
for them to stay.  The local Kuomintang urged them to join the army.

"Fight back to your homeland!"  they were told.

This was not what they had fled Manchuria for.  Some Communist
underground workers who had sailed with them encouraged them to take a
stand, and on 5 July the students demonstrated in the center of Tianjin
for food and accommodations.  Troops opened fire and scores of students
were injured, some seriously, and a number were killed.

When the news reached Jinzhou, my mother immediately decided to
organize support for the students who had gone to Tianjin.  She called
a meeting of the heads of the student unions of all the seven high and
technical schools, which voted to set up the Jinzhou Federation of
Student Unions.  My mother was elected to the chair.  They decided to
send a telegram of solidarity to the students in Tianjin and to stage a
march to the headquarters of General Chill, the martial law commander,
to present a petition.

My mother's friends were waiting anxiously at school for instructions.
It was a gray, rainy day and the ground had turned to sticky mud.
Darkness fell and there was still no sign of my mother and the other
six student leaders.  Then the news came that the police had raided the
meeting and taken them away.  They had been informed on by Yao-han, the
political supervisor at my mother's school.

They were marched to the martial law headquarters.

After a while, General Chill strode into the room.  He faced them
across a table and started to talk to them in a patient, paternalistic
tone of voice, apparently more in sorrow than in anger.  They were
young and liable to do rash things, he said.  But what did they know
about politics?  Did they realize they were being used by the
Communists? They should x36 "Daughter Jbr Sale for l o Kilos of Rice'
stick to their books.  He said he would release them if they would sign
a confession admitting their mistakes and identifying the Communists
behind them.  Then he paused to watch the effect of his words.

My mother found his lecturing and his whole attitude insufferable.  She
stepped forward and said in a loud voice:

"Tell us, Commander, what mistake have we made?"  The general became
irritated: "You were used by the Communist bandits to stir up trouble.
Isn't that mistake enough?"

My mother shouted back: "What Communist bandits?  Our friends died in
Tianjin because they had run away from the Communists, on your advice.
Do they deserve to be shot by you?  Have we done anything
unreasonable?"  After some fierce exchanges the general banged his fist
on the table and bellowed for his guards.

"Show her around," he said, and then, turning to my mother, "You need
to realize where you are!"  Before the soldiers could seize her, my
mother leaped forward and banged her fist on the table:

"Wherever I may be, I have not done anything wrong!"

The next thing my mother knew she was held tight by both arms and
dragged away from the table.  She was pulled along a corridor and down
some stairs into a dark room.

On the far side she could see a man dressed in rags.  He seemed to be
sitting on a bench and leaning against a pillar.

His head was lolling to one side.  Then my mother realized that he was
tied to the pillar and his thighs were tied to the bench.  Two men were
pushing bricks under his heels.

Each additional brick brought forth a deep, stifled groan.

My mother felt her head was filled with blood, and she thought she
heard the cracking of bones.  The next thing she knew she was looking
into another room.  Her guide, an officer, drew her attention to a man
almost next to where they were standing.  He was hanging from a wooden
beam by his wrists and was naked from the waist upward.

His hair hung down in a tangled mess, so that my mother could not see
his face.  On the floor was a brazier, with a man sit ling beside it
casually smoking a cigarette.  As my mother watched, he lifted an iron
bar out of the fire; the tip was the size of a man's fist and was
glowing red-hot With a grin, he plunged it into the chest of the man
hanging from the beam.  My mother heard a sharp scream of pain and a
horrible sizzling sound, saw smoke coming from the wound, and could
smell the heavy odor of burned flesh.

But she did not scream or faint.  The horror had aroused in her a
powerful, passionate rage which gave her enormous strength and overrode
any fear.

The officer asked her if she would now write a confession.  She
refused, repeating that she knew of no Communists behind her.  She was
bundled into a small room which contained a bed and some sheets.  There
she spent several long days, listening to the screams of people being
tortured in rooms nearby, and refusing repeated demands to name
names.

Then one day she was taken to a yard at the back of the building,
covered with weeds and rubble, and ordered to stand against a high
wall.  Next to her a man who had obviously been tortured and could
barely stand was propped up.  Several soldiers lazily took their
positions.  A man blindfolded her.  Even though she could not see, she
closed her eyes.  She was ready to die, proud that she was giving her
life for a great cause.

She heard shots, but felt nothing.  After a minute or so her blindfold
was removed and she looked around, blinking.  The man who had been
standing next to her was lying on the ground.  The officer who had
taken her down to the dungeons came over, grinning.  One eyebrow was
raised in surprise that this seventeen-year-old girl was not a
gibbering wreck.  My mother told him calmly that she had nothing to
confess.

She was taken back to her cell.  Nobody bothered her, and she was not
tortured.  After a few more days she was set free.  During the previous
week the Communist underground had been busy pulling strings.  My
grandmother had been to the martial law headquarters every day, weep
x38 "Daughter Jbr Sale Jbr l o Kilos of Rice' ing, pleading, and
threatening suicide.  Dr.  Xia had visited his most powerful patients,
bearing expensive gifts.  The family's intelligence connections were
also mobilized.

Many people had vouched for my mother in wrifng, saying that she was
not a Communist, she was just young and impetuous.

What had happened to her did not daunt her in the slightest.  The
moment she came out of prison she set about organizing a memorial
service for the dead students in Tianjin.  The authorities gave
permission for the service.

There was great anger in Jinzhou about what had happened to the young
people who had, after all, left on the government's advice.  At the
same time, the schools hurriedly announced an early end to the term,
scrapping examinations, in the hope that the students would go home and
disband.

At this point the underground advised its members to leave for the
Communist-controlled areas.  Those who did not want to, or could not
leave, were ordered to suspend their clandestine work.  The Kuomintang
was clamping down fiercely, and too many operatives were being arrested
and executed.  Liang was leaving, and he asked my mother to go too, but
my grandmother would not allow it.  My mother was not suspected of
being a Communist, she said, but if she left with the Communists she
would be.  And what about all the people who had vouched for her?  If
she went now they would all be in trouble.

So she stayed.  But she was longing for action.  She turned to Yu-wu,
the only person left in the city who she knew was working for the
Communists.  Yu-wu did not know Liang or my mother's other contacts.
They belonged to different underground systems, which operated
completely separately, so that if anyone was caught and could not
withstand torture they could only reveal a limited number of names.

Jinzhou was the key supply and logistic center for all the Kuomintang
armies in the northeast.  They numbered over half a million men, strung
out along vulnerable railway lines and concentrated in a few shrinking
areas around the main cities.  By the summer of 1948 there were about
200,000 Kuomintang troops in Jinzhou, under several different commands.
Chiang Kai-shek had been squabbling with many of his top generals,
juggling the commands, which created severe demoralization.  The
different forces were badly coordinated and often distrusted one
another.

Many strategists, including his senior American advisers, thought that
Chiang should abandon Manchuria completely.  The key to any pullout,
'voluntary' or forced, by sea or by rail, was the retention of Jinzhou.
The city was only a hundred miles north of the Great Wall, quite near
to China proper, where the Kuomintang position still seemed relatively
secure, and it was easily reinforced from the sea Huludao was only
about thirty miles to the south, and was linked by a seemingly secure
railway.

In spring 1948 the Kuomintang had begun to construct a new defense
system around Jinzhou, made of cement blocks encased in steel frames.
The Communists, they thought, had no tanks and poor artillery, and no
experience attacking heavily fortified positions.  The idea was to ring
the city with self-contained fortresses, each of which could operate as
an independent unit even if it was surrounded.

The fortresses were to be connected by trenches six feet wide and six
feet deep, protected by a continuous fence of barbed wire.  The supreme
commander in Manchuria, General Wei Li-huang, came on an inspection
visit and declared the system impregnable.

But the project was never finished, par fly due to lack of materials
and poor planning, but mainly because of corruption.  The man in charge
of the construction work siphoned off building materials and sold them
on the black market;

the workers were not paid enough to eat.  By September, when the
Communist forces began to cut the city off, only a third of the system
had been completed, much of it small,

x4o "Daughter for Sale Jbr ~ o Kilos of Rice' unconnected cement forts.
Other parts had been has lily assembled from mud taken from the old
city wall.

It was vital for the Communists to know about this system and about the
disposition of the Kuomintang troops.  The Communists were building up
enormous forces about a quarter of a million men for a decisive battle.
The commander in chief of all the Communist armies, Zhu De, cabled the
commander on the spot, Lin Biao: "Take Jinzhou ... and the whole
Chinese situation is in our hands."  Yu-wu's group was asked to provide
up-to-date information before the final attack.

He urgently needed more hands, and when my mother approached him asking
for work, he and his superiors were delighted.

The Communists had sent some officers into the city in disguise to
reconnoiter, but a man wandering around the outskirts alone would
immediately attract attention.  An amorous couple would be much less
conspicuous.  By then, Kuomintang rule had made it quite acceptable for
young men and women to be seen together in public.  Because the
reconnaissance officers were male, my mother would be ideal as a
'girlfriend."

Yu-wu told her to be at an appointed place at a particular time.  She
was to wear a pale-blue gown and a red silk flower in her hair.  The
Communist officer would be carrying a copy of the Kuomintang newspaper,
the Central Daily folded into a triangle, and would identify himself by
wiping sweat three times off the left side of his face and then three
times off the right.

On the appointed day, my mother went to a small temple just outside the
old north wall but within the defense perimeter.  A man carrying the
triangular newspaper came up to her and gave the correct signals.  My
mother stroked his right cheek three times with her right hand, then he
stroked her left cheek three times with his left hand.  Then my mother
took his arm, and they walked off.

My mother did not understand fully what he was doing,

In Battle for a New China x4x and she did not ask.  Most of the time
they walked in silence, only talking when they passed someone.  The
mission passed off without incident.

There were to be more, around the city outskirts and to the railway,
the vital communications artery.

It was one thing to obtain the information, but it was another to get
it out of the city.  By the end of July the checkpoints were firmly
shut, and anyone trying to enter or leave was thoroughly searched.
Yu-wu consulted my mother, whose ability and courage he had grown to
trust.

The vehicles of senior officers could go in and out without being
searched, and my mother thought of a contact she might be able to use.
One of her fellow students was the granddaughter of a local army
commander, General Ji, and the girl's brother was a colonel in their
grandfather's brigade.

The Jis were a Jinzhou family, with considerable influence.  They
occupied a whole street, nicknamed "Ji Street," where they had a large
compound with an extensive, well groomed garden.  My mother had often
strolled in the garden with her friend, and was quite friendly with her
brother, Hui-ge.

Hui-ge was a handsome young man in his mid-twenties who had a
university degree in engineering.  Unlike many young men from wealthy,
powerful families, he was not a dandy.  My mother liked him, and the
feeling was mutual.

He began to pay social calls on the Xias and to invite my mother to tea
parties.  My grandmother liked him a lot; he was extremely courteous,
and she considered him highly eligible.

Soon Hui-ge started to invite my mother out on her own.  At first his
sister accompanied him, pretending to be a chaperone, but soon she
would disappear with some flimsy excuse.  She praised her brother to my
mother, adding that he was their grandfather's favorite.  She must also
have told her brother about my mother, because my mother discovered
that he knew a lot about her, including the fact x42 "Daughter for Sale
for zo Kilos of Rice' that she had been arrested for her radical
activities.  They found they had much in common.  Hui-ge was very frank
about the Kuomintang.  Once or twice he tugged at his colonel's uniform
and sighed that he hoped the war would end soon so he could go back to
his engineering.  He told my mother he thought the Kuomintang's days
were numbered, and she had the feeling that he was baring his innermost
thoughts.

She was certain he was fond of her, but she wondered if there might be
political motives behind his actions.  She deduced that he must be
trying to get a message across to her, and through her to the
Communists.  The message had to be: I don't like the Kuomintang, and I
am willing to help you.

They became tacit conspirators.  One day my mother suggested that he
might surrender to the Communists with some troops (which was a fairly
common occurrence).  He said he was only a staff officer and did not
command any troops.  My mother asked him to try to persuade his
grandfather to go over, but he replied sadly that the old man would
probably have him shot if he even suggested it.

My mother kept Yu-wu informed, and he told her to cultivate Hui-ge.
Soon Yu-wu told her to ask Hui-ge to take her for a trip outside the
city in his jeep.  They went on such trips three or four times, and
each time, when they reached a primitive mud toilet, she said she had
to use it.

She got out and hid a message in a hole in the toilet wall while he
waited in his jeep.  He never asked any questions.

His conversations became more and more centered on his worries about
his family and himself.  In a roundabout way, he hinted that the
Communists might execute him: "I'm afraid I'll soon just be a
disembodied soul outside the western gate?"  (The Western Heaven was
supposed to be the destination of the dead, because it was the site of
eternal peace.  So the execution ground in Jinzhou, like most places in
China, was outside the western gate.) When

In Battle for a New China i 43 he said this, he would look
questioningly into my mother's eyes, clearly inviting contradiction.

My mother felt certain that because of what he had done for them the
Communists would spare him.  Although everything had been implicit, she
would say confidently:

"Don't think such gloomy thoughts?"  or "I'm sure that won't happen to
you!"

The Kuomintang position continued to deteriorate through the late
summer- and not only because of military action.  Corruption wreaked
havoc.  Inflation had risen to the unimaginable figure of just over
100,000 percent by the end of 1947 and it was to go to 2,870,000
percent by the end of 1948 in the Kuomintang areas.  The price of
sorghum, the main grain available, increased seventy fold overnight in
Jinzhou.  For the civilian population the situation was becoming more
desperate every day, as increasingly more food went to the army, much
of which was sold by local commanders on the black market.

The Kuomintang high command was divided over strategy.  Chiang Kai-shek
recommended abandoning Mukden, the largest city in Manchuria, and
concentrating on holding Jinzhou, but he was unable to impose a
coherent strategy on his top generals.  He seemed to place all his hope
on greater American intervention.  Defeatism permeated his top staff.

By September the Kuomintang held only three strongholds in Manchuria
Mukden, Changchun (the old capital of Manchukuo, Hsinking), and Jinzhou
and the 3o0 miles of railway track linking them.  The Communists were
encircling all three cities simultaneously, and the Kuomintang did not
know where the main attack would come.  In fact it was to be Jinzhou,
the most southerly of the three and the strategic key, because once it
fell the other two would be cut off from their supplies.  The
Communists were able to move large numbers of troops around undetected,
but the Kuomintang were dependent on the railway,
which was under constant
attack, and, to a lesser extent, on air transport.

The assault on Jinzhou began on 11 September 1948.

An American diplomat, John F. Melby, flying to Mukden, recorded in his
diary on 23 September: "North along the corridor to Manchuria the
Communist artillery was systematically making rubble out of the
airfield at Chinchow [Jinzhou]."  The next day, 24 September, the
Communist forces moved closer.  Twenty-four hours later Chiang Kaishek
ordered General Wei Li-huang to break out of Mukden with fifteen
divisions and relieve Jinzhou.  General Wei dithered, and by 26
September the Communists had virtually isolated Jinzhou.

By 1 October the encirclement of Jinzhou was completed.  Yixian, my
grandmother's hometown twenty-five miles to the north, fell that day.
Chiang Kai-shek flew to Mukden to take personal command.  He ordered
seven extra divisions to be thrown into the Jinzhou battle, but he was
unable even to get General Wei to move out of Mukden until 9 October,
two weeks after the order had been given and even then with only eleven
divisions, not fifteen.  On 6 October Chiang Kai-shek flew to Huludao
and ordered troops there to move up to relieve Jinzhou.

Some did, but piecemeal, and they were soon isolated and destroyed.

The Communists were getting ready to turn the assault on Jinzhou into a
siege.  Yu-wu approached my mother and asked her to undertake a
critical mission: to smuggle detonators into one of the ammunition
depots the one supplying Hui-ge's own division.  The ammunition was
stored in a big courtyard, the walls of which were tolaped with barbed
wire which was reputed to be electrified.

Everyone who went in and out was searched.  The soldiers living inside
the complex spent most of their time gambling and drinking.  Sometimes
prostitutes were brought in and the officers would hold a dance in a
makeshift club.  My mother told Hui-ge she wanted to go and have a look
at the dancing, and he agreed without asking any questions.

The detonators were handed to my mother the next day by a man she had
never seen.  She put them into her bag and drove into the depot with
Hui-ge.  They were not searched.  When they got inside, she asked
Hui-ge to show her around, leaving her bag in the car, as she had been
instructed.  Once they were out of sight, underground operatives were
supposed to remove the detonators.  My mother strolled at a
deliberately leisurely pace to give the men more time.  Hui-ge was
happy to oblige.

That night, the city was rocked by a gigantic explosion.

Detonations went off in chain reactions and the dynamite and shells lit
up the sky like a spectacular fireworks display.

The street where the depot had been was in flames.

Windows were shattered within a radius of about fifty yards.  The next
morning, Hui-ge invited my mother over to the Ji mansion.  His eyes
were hollow and he was unshaven.  He had obviously not slept a wink. He
greeted her a little more guardedly than usual.

After a heavy silence, he asked her whether she had heard the news. Her
expression must have confirmed his worst fears that he had helped to
cripple his own division.

He said there was going to be an investigation.

"I wonder whether the explosion will sweep my head from my shoulders,"
he sighed, 'or blow a reward my way?"  My mother, who was feeling sorry
for him, said reassuringly: "I am sure you are beyond suspicion.  I'm
certain you will be rewarded."  At this, Hui-ge stood up and saluted
her in formal fashion.

"Thank you for your promise!"  he said.

By now, Communist artillery shells had begun to crash into the city.
When my mother first heard the whine of the shells flying over, she was
a lit He frightened.  But later, when the shelling became heavier, she
got used to it.  It became like permanent thunder.  A kind of
fatalistic indifference deadened fear for most people.  The siege also
broke down Dr.  Xia's rigid Manchu ritual; for the first time the whole
household ate together, men and women,

x46 "Daughter Jbr Sale for I o Kilos of Rice' masters and servants.
Previously, they had been eating in no less than eight groups, all
having different food.  One day, as they were sitting around the table
preparing to have dinner, a shell came bursting through the window over
the kang, where Yu-lin's one-year-old son was playing, and thudded to a
halt under the dining table.  Fortunately, like many of the shells, it
was a dud.

Once the siege started there was no food to be had, even on the black
market.  A hundred million Kuomintang dollars could barely buy a pound
of sorghum.  Like most families who could afford to do so, my
grandmother had stored some sorghum and soybeans, and her sister's
husband, "Loyalty' Pei-o, used his connections to get some extra
supplies.  During the siege the family's donkey was killed by a piece
of shrapnel, so they ate it.

On 8 October the Communists moved almost a quarter of a million troops
into attack positions.  The shelling became much more intense.  It was
also very accurate.  The top Kuomintang commander, General Fan Han-jie,
said that it seemed to follow him wherever he went.  Many artillery
positions were knocked out, and the fortresses in the uncompleted
defense system came under heavy fire, as did the road and railway
links.  Telephone and cable lines were cut, and the electricity system
broke down.

On 13 October the outer defenses collapsed.  More than 100,000
Kuomintang troops retreated pell-mell into the center of the city. That
night a band of about a dozen disheveled soldiers stormed into the
Xias' house and demanded food.  They had not eaten for two days.  Dr.
Xia greeted them courteously and Yu-lin's wife immediately started
cooking a huge saucepan of sorghum noodles.

When they were ready, she put them on the kitchen table and went into
the next room to tell the soldiers.  As she turned her back, a shell
landed in the saucepan and exploded, spattering the noodles all over
the kitchen.  She dived under a narrow table in front of the kang.  A
soldier was ahead of her, but she grabbed him by the leg and

pulled him out.  My grandmother was terrified.

"What if he had turned around and pulled the trigger?"  she hissed once
he was out of earshot.

Until the very final stage of the siege the shelling was amazingly
accurate; few ordinary houses were hit, but the population suffered
from the terrible fires which the shelling ignited, and there was no
water to douse the flames.

The sky was completely obscured by thick, dark smoke and it was
impossible to see more than a few yards, even in daytime.  The noise of
the artillery was deafening.  My mother could hear people wailing, but
could never tell where they were or what was happening.

On 14 October, the final offensive started.  Nine hundred artillery
pieces bombarded the city nonstop.  Most of the family hid in an
improvised air-raid shelter which they had dug earlier, but Dr.  Xia
refused to leave the house.  He sat calmly on the kang in the corner of
his room by the window and prayed silently to the Buddha.  At one point
fourteen kittens ran into the room.  He was delighted: "A place a cat
tries to hide in is a lucky place," he said.  Not a single bullet came
into his room and all the kittens survived.  The only other person who
would not go down into the shelter was my great-grandmother, who just
curled up under the oak table next to the kang in her room.  When the
bat He ended the thick quilts and blankets covering the table looked
like a sieve.

In the middle of one bombardment, Yu-lin's baby son, who was down in
the shelter, wanted to have a wee-wee.

His mother took him outside, and a few seconds later the side of the
shelter where she had been sitting collapsed.

My mother and grandmother had to come up and take cover in the house.
My mother crouched next to the kang in the kitchen, but soon pieces of
shrapnel started hitting the brick side of the kang and the house began
to shake.

She ran out into the back garden.  The sky was black with smoke.
Bullets were flying through the air and ricocheting all over the place,
spattering against the walls; the sound
was like mighty rain pelting down, mixed with screams
and yells.

In the small hours of the next day a group of Kuomintang soldiers burst
into the house, dragging about twenty terrified civilians of all ages
with them the residents of the three neighboring courtyards.  The
troops were almost hysterical.  They had come from an arfllery post in
a temple across the street, which had just been shelled with pinpoint
accuracy, and were shouting at the civilians that one of them must have
given away their position.  They kept yelling that they wanted to know
who had given the signal.

When no one spoke up, they grabbed my mother and shoved her against a
wall, accusing her.  My grandmother was terrified, and hurriedly dug
out some small gold pieces and pressed them into the soldiers' hands.
She and Dr.  Xia went down on their knees and begged the soldiers to
let my mother go.  Yu-lin's wife said this was the only time she ever
saw Dr.  Xia looking really frightened.  He pleaded with the soldiers:
"She's my little girl.  Please believe me that she did not do it ....
'

The soldiers took the gold and let my mother go, but they forced
everyone into two rooms at bayonet point and shut them in so they would
not send any more signals, they said.  It was pitch-dark inside the
rooms, and very frightening.  But quite soon my mother noticed that the
shelling was decreasing.  The noises outside changed.

Mixed with the whine of bullets were sounds of hand grenades exploding
and the clash of bayonets.  Voices were yelling, "Put down your weapons
and we'll spare your life!"

there were blood-curdling shrieks and screams of anger and pain.  Then
the shots and the shouts came closer and closer, and she heard the
sound of boots clattering on the cobblestones as the Kuomintang
soldiers ran away down the street.

Eventually the din subsided a bit and the Xias could hear banging on
the side gate of the house.  Dr.  Xia went warily to the door of the
room and eased it open: the Kuomintang soldiers had gone.  Then he went
to the side gate of the house and asked who was there.  A voice
answered: "We are the people's army.  We have come to liberate you."
Dr.  Xia opened the gate and several men in baggy uniforms entered
swiftly.  In the darkness, my mother could see that they were wearing
white towels wrapped around their left sleeves like armbands and held
their guns at the ready, with fixed bayonets.

"Don't be afraid," they said.

"We won't harm you.  We are your army, the people's army."  They said
they wanted to check the house for Kuomintang soldiers.

It was not a request, though it was put politely.  The soldiers did not
turn the place upside down, nor did they ask for food or steal
anything.  After the search they left, bidding the family a courteous
farewell.

It was only when the soldiers entered the house that it sank in that
the Communists had really taken the city.  My mother was overjoyed This
time she did not feel let down by the Communist soldiers' dust covered
torn uniforms.

All the people who had been sheltering in the Xias' house were anxious
to get back to their houses to see if they had been damaged or looted.
One house had in fact been leveled, and a pregnant woman who had
remained there was killed.

Shortly after the neighbors left there was another knock on the side
gate.  My mother opened it: half a dozen terrified Kuomintang soldiers
stood there.  They were in a pitiable state and their eyes were gnawed
by fear.  They kowtowed to Dr.  Xia and my grandmother and begged for
civilian clothes.  The Xias felt sorry for them and gave them some old
clothes which they hurriedly put on over their uniforms and left.

At first light Yu-lin's wife opened the front gate.  Several corpses
were lying right outside.  She let out a terrified yell and ran back
into the house.  My mother heard her shriek and went outside to have a
look.  Corpses were lying all over the street, many of them with their
heads and limbs x5o "Daughter for Sale for lo Kilos of Rice' missing,
others with their intestines pouring out.  Some were just bloody
messes. Chunks of flesh and arms and legs were hanging from the
telegraph poles.  The open sewers were clogged with bloody water, human
flesh, and rubble.

The battle for Jinzhou had been herculean.  The final attack had lasted
thirty-one hours, and in many ways it was the turning point of the
civil war.  Twenty thousand Kuomintang soldiers were killed and over
80,000 captured.

No fewer than eighteen generals were taken prisoner, among them the
supreme commander of the Kuomintang forces in Jinzhou, General Fan
Han-jie, who had tried to escape disguised as a civilian.  As the
prisoners of war thronged the streets on their way to the temporary
camps, my mother saw a friend of hers with her Kuomintang officer
husband, both of them wrapped in blankets against the morning chill.

It was Communist policy not to execute anyone who laid down their arms,
and to treat all prisoners well.  This would help win over the ordinary
soldiers, most of whom came from poor peasant families.  The Communists
did not run prison camps.  They kept only middle- and high-ranking
officers, and dispersed the rest almost immediately.  They would hold
'speak bitterness' meetings for the soldiers, at which they were
encouraged to speak up about their hard lives as landless peasants. The
revolution, the Communists said, was all about giving them land. The
soldiers were given a choice: either they could go home, in which case
they would be given their fare, or they could stay with the Communists
to help wipe out the Kuomintang so that nobody would ever take their
land away again.  Most willingly stayed and joined the Communist army. 
Some, of course, could not physically reach their homes with a war
going on.  Mao had learned from ancient Chinese warfare that the most
effective way of conquering the people was to conquer their hearts and
minds.  The policy toward prisoners proved enormously successful. 
Particularly after

In Battle Jbr a New China 15 l Jinzhou, more and more Kuomintang
soldiers simply let themselves be captured.  Over 1.75 million
Kuomintang troops surrendered and crossed over to the Communists during
the civil war.  In the last year of the civil war, bat He casualties
accounted for less than 2o percent of all the troops the Kuomintang
lost.

One of the top commanders who had been caught had his daughter with
him; she was in an advanced stage of pregnancy.  He asked the Communist
commanding officer if he could stay in Jinzhou with her.  The Communist
officer said it was not convenient for a father to help his daughter
deliver a baby, and that he would send a 'woman comrade' to help her.
The Kuomintang officer thought he was only saying this to get him to
move on.  Later on he learned that his daughter had been very well
treated, and the 'woman comrade' turned out to be the wife of the
Communist officer.  Policy toward prisoners was an intricate
combination of political calculation and humanitarian consideration,
and this was one of the crucial factors in the Communists' victory.
Their goal was not just to crush the opposing army but, if possible, to
bring about its disintegration.  The Kuomintang was defeated as much by
demoralization as by firepower.

The first priority after the battle was cleaning up, most of which was
done by Communist soldiers.  The locals were also keen to help, as they
wanted to get rid of the bodies and the debris around their homes as
quickly as possible.

For days, long convoys of carts loaded with corpses and lines of people
carrying baskets on their shoulders could be seen wending their way out
of the city.  As it became possible to move around again, my mother
found that many people she knew had been killed; some from direct hits,
others buried under rubble when their houses had collapsed.

The morning after the siege ended the Communists put up notices asking
the townspeople to resume normal life as quickly as possible.  Dr.  Xia
hung out his gaily decorated
shingle to show that his
medicine shop was open and was later told by the Communist
administration that he was the first doctor in the city to do so.  Most
shops reopened on 20 October even though the streets were not yet
cleared of bodies.  Two days later, schools reopened and offices began
working normal hours.

The most immediate problem was food.  The new government urged the
peasants to come and sell food in the city and encouraged them to do so
by setting prices at twice what they were in the countryside.  The
price of sorghum fell rapidly, from 100 million Kuomintang dollars for
a pound to 2,200 dollars.  An ordinary worker could soon buy four
pounds of sorghum with what he could earn in a day.  Fear of starvation
abated.  The Communists issued relief grain, salt, and coal to the
destitute.  The Kuomintang had never done anything like this, and
people were hugely impressed.

Another thing that captured the goodwill of the locals was the
discipline of the Communist soldiers.  Not only was there no looting or
rape, but many went out of their way to demonstrate exemplary behavior.
This was in sharp contrast with the Kuomintang troops.

The city remained in a state of high alert.  American planes flew over
threateningly.  On 23 October sizable Kuomintang forces tried
unsuccessfully to retake Jinzhou with a pincer movement from Huludao
and the northeast.  With the loss of Jinzhou, the huge armies around
Mukden and Changchun quickly collapsed or surrendered, and by 2
November the whole of Manchuria was in Communist hands.

The Communists proved extremely efficient at restoring order and
getting the economy going again.  Banks in Jinzhou reopened on 3
December, and the electricity supply resumed the next day.  On 29
December a notice went up announcing a new street administration
system, with residents' committees in place of the old neighborhood
committees.  These were to be a key institution in the Communist system
of administration and control.  The next day

In Battle ~r a New China I 5 3 running water resumed and on the 3ist
the railwa~ reopened.

The Communists even managed to put an end to inflation, setting a
favorable exchange rate for converting the worthless Kuomintang money
into Communist "Great Wall' currency.

From the moment the Communist forces arrived, my mother had been
longing to throw herself into working for the revolution.  She felt
herself to be very much a part of the Communist cause.  After some days
of waiting impatiently, she was approached by a Party representative
who gave her an appointment to see the man in charge of youth work in
Jinzhou, a Comrade Wang Yu.

6. "Talking about Love' ^ Revolutionary Marriage

(1948-1949)

My mother set off to see Comrade Wang one morning on a mild autumn day,
the best time of year in Jinzhou.  The summer heat had gone and the air
had begun to grow cooler, but it was still warm enough to wear summer
clothes.  The wind and dust which plague the town for much of the year
were deliciously absent.

She was wearing a traditional loose pale blue gown and a white silk
scarf.  Her hair had just been cut short in keeping with the new
revolutionary fashion.  As she walked into the courtyard of the new
provincial government headquarters she saw a man standing under a tree
with his back to her, brushing his teeth at the edge of a flowerbed.
She waited for him to finish, and when he lifted his head she saw that
he was in his late twenties, with a very dark face and big, wistful
eyes.  Under his baggy uniform she could see that he was thin, and she
thought he looked a lit He shorter than herself.  There was something
dreamy about him.  My mother thought he looked like a poet.

"Comrade Wang, I am Xia De-hong from the students' association," she
said.

"I am here to report on our work."

"Wang' was the nora de guerre of the man who was to

A Revolutionary Marriage I 55 become my father.  He had entered Jinzhou
with the Communist forces a few days earlier.  Since late 1945 he had
been a commander with the guerrillas in the area.  He was now head of
the Secretariat and a member of the Communist Party Committee governing
Jinzhou, and was soon to be appointed head of the Public Affairs
Department of the city, which looked after education, the literacy
drive, health, the press, entertainment, sports, youth, and sounding
out public opinion.  It was an important post.

He was born in 1921 in Yibin in the southwestern province of Sichuan,
about 1,200 miles from Jinzhou.  Yibin, which then had a population of
about 30,000, lies at the spot where the Min River joins the Golden
Sand River to form the Yangtze, the longest river in China.  The area
around Yibin is one of the very fertile parts of Sichuan, which is
known as "Heaven's Granary," and the warm, misty climate in Yibin makes
it an ideal place for growing tea.  Much of the black tea consumed in
Britain today comes from there.

My father was the seventh of nine children.  His father had worked as
an apprentice for a textile manufacturer since the age of twelve.  When
he became an adult he and his brother, who worked in the same factory,
decided to start their own business.  Within a few years they were
prospering, and were able to buy a large house.

But their old boss was jealous of their success, and brought a lawsuit
against them, accusing them of stealing money from him to start their
business.  The case lasted seven years, and the brothers were forced to
spend all their assets trying to clear themselves.  Everyone connected
with the court extorted money from them, and the greed of the officials
was insatiable.  My grandfather was thrown into prison.  The only way
his brother could get him out was to get the ex-boss to drop the suit.
To do this he had to raise 1,000 pieces of silver.  This destroyed
them, and my great-uncle died soon afterward at the age of thirty-four
from worry and exhaustion.

My grandfather found himself looking after two families, with fifteen
dependents.  He started up his business again, and by the late 1920s
was beginning to do well.  But it was a time of widespread fighfng
among warlords, who all levied heavy taxes.  This, combined with the
effects of the Great Depression, made it an extremely difficult time to
run a textile factory.  In 1933 my grandfather died of overwork and
strain, at age forty-five.  The business was sold to pay off the debts,
and the family was scattered.  Some became soldiers, which was
considered pretty much a last resort; with all the fighting going on,
it was easy for a soldier to get killed.  Other brothers and cousins
found odd jobs and the gifts married as best they could.  One of my
father's cousins, who was fifteen years old and to whom he was very
attached, had to marry an opium addict several decades her senior. When
the sedan chair came to carry her away, my father ran after her, not
knowing if he would ever see her again.

My father loved books, and began to learn to read classical prose at
the age of three, which was quite exceptional.

The year after my grandfather died he had to abandon school.  He was
only thirteen and hated having to give up his studies.  He had to find
a job, so the following year, 1935, he left Yibin and went down the
Yangtze to Chongqing, a much bigger city.  He found a job as an
apprentice in a grocery store working twelve hours a day.  One of his
jobs was to carry his boss's enormous water pipe as he moved around the
city reclining on a bamboo chair carried on the shoulders of two men.
The sole purpose of this was for his boss to flaunt the fact that he
could afford a servant to carry his water pipe, which could easily have
been put in the chair.  My father received no pay, just a bed and two
meager meals a day.  He got no supper, and went to bed every night with
cramps from an empty stomach; he was obsessed by hunger.

His eldest sister was also living in Chongking.  She had married a
schoolteacher, and their mother had come to live with them after her
husband died.  One day my father was so hungry he went into their
kitchen and ate a cold sweet potato.  When his sister found out she
turned on him and yelled: "It's difficult enough for me to support our
mother.  I can't afford to feed a brother as well."  My father was so
hurt he ran out of the house and never returned.

He asked his boss to give him supper.  His boss not only refused, but
started to abuse him.  In anger, my father left and went back to Yibin
and lived doing odd jobs as an apprentice in one store after another.
He encountered suffering not only in his own life, but all around him.
Every day as he walked to work he passed an old man selling baked
rolls.  The old man, who shuffled along with great difficulty, bent
double, was blind.  To attract the attention of passersby, he sang a
heart-rending tune.  Every time my father heard the song he said to
himself that the sociew must change.

He began to cast around for some way out.  He had always remembered the
first time he heard the word 'communism': it was when he was seven
years old, in 1928.  He was playing near his home when he saw that a
big crowd had gathered at a crossroads nearby.  He squeezed his way to
the front: there he saw a young man sitting cross-legged on the ground.
His hands were tied behind his back; standing over him was a stout man
with an enormous broadsword.  The young man, strangely, was allowed to
talk for a time about his ideals and about something called communism.
Then the executioner brought the sword down on the back of his neck. My
father screamed and covered his eyes.  He was shaken to the core, but
he was also hugely impressed by the man's courage and calmness in the
face of death.

By the second half of the 1930s, even in the remote backwater of Yibin,
the Communists were beginning to organize a sizable underground.  Their
main plank was resisting the Japanese.  Chiang Kai-shek had adopted a
policy of nonresistance in the face of the Japanese seizure
of Manchuria and increasing encroachments on China
proper and had concentrated on trying to annihilate the Communists. The
Communists launched a slogan, "Chinese must not fight Chinese," and put
pressure on Chiang Kai-shek to focus on fighting the Japanese.  In
December 1936 Chiang was kidnapped by two of his own generals, one of
them the Young Marshal, Chang Hsuehliang, from Manchuria.  He was saved
partly by the Communists, who helped get him released in return for his
agreement to form a united front against Japan.  Chiang Kai-shek had to
consent, albeit half-heartedly, since he knew this would allow the
Communists to survive and develop.

"The Japanese are a disease of the skin," he said, 'the Communists are
a disease of the heart."  Though the Communists and the Kuomintang were
supposed to be allies, the Communists still had to work underground in
most areas.

In July 1937 the Japanese began their all-out invasion of China proper.
My father, like many others, felt appalled and desperate about what was
happening to his country.

At about this time he started working in a bookshop which sold
left-wing publications.  He devoured book after book at night in the
shop, where he functioned as a kind of night watchman.

He supplemented his earnings from the bookshop with an evening job as
an 'explainer' in a cinema.  Many of the films were American silents.
His job was to stand beside the screen and explain what was going on,
as the films were neither dubbed nor subtitled.  He also joined an
antiJapanese theater group, and as he was a slender young man with
delicate features, he acted women's roles.

My father loved the theater group.  It was through the friends he made
there that he first entered into contact with the Communist
underground.  The Communist stance about fighting the Japanese and
about creating a just society fired his imagination and he joined the
Party in 1938, when he was seventeen.  It was a time when the

Kuomintang was being extremely vigilant about Communist activities in
Sichuan.  Nanjing, the capital, had fallen to the Japanese in December
1937, and Chiang Kai-shek subsequently moved his government to
Chongqing.  The move precipitated a flurry of police activity in
Sichuan, and my father's theater group was forcibly disbanded.  Some of
his friends were arrested.  Others had to flee.  My father felt
frustrated that he could not do anything for his country.

A few years before, Communist forces had passed through remote parts of
Sichuan on their 6,000-mile Long March, which ultimately took them to
the small town of Yan'an in the northwest.  People in the theater group
had talked a lot about Yan'an as a place of camaraderie, uncorrupt and
efficient- my father's dream.  At the beginning of 1940 he set out on
his own long march to Yan'an.  He first went to Chongqing, where one of
his brothers-in-law, who was an officer in Chiang Kai-shek's army,
wrote a letter to help him cross Kuomintang-occupied areas and get
through the blockade that Chiang Kai-shek had thrown up around Yan'an.
The journey took him almost four months.  By the time he arrived it was
April 1940.

Yan'an lay on the Yellow Earth Plateau, in a remote and barren part of
northwest China.  Dominated by a nine tiered pagoda, much of the town
consisted of rows of caves cut into the yellow cliffs.  My father was
to make these caves his home for over five years.  Mao Zedong and his
much-depleted forces had arrived there at different times in 1935 -
1936, at the end of the Long March, and subsequently made it the
capital of their republic.  Yan'an was surrounded by hostile territory;
its chief advantage was its remoteness, which made it difficult to
attack.

After a short spell at a Party school, my father applied to join one of
the Party's most prestigious institutions, the Academy of
Marxist-Leninist Studies.  The entrance exam was quite stiff, but he
took first place, as a result of his reading deep into the night in the
loft of the bookshop in Yibin.  His fellow candidates were amazed. Most
of them had come from the big cities like Shanghai, and had looked down
on him as a bit of a yokel.  My father became the youngest research
fellow in the Academy.

My father loved Yan'an.  He found the people there full of enthusiasm,
optimism, and purpose.  The Party leaders lived simply, like everyone
else, in striking contrast with Kuomintang officials.  Yan'an was no
democracy, but compared with where he had come from it seemed to be a
paradise of fairness.

In 1942 Mao started a "Rectfication' campaign, and invited criticisms
about the way things were being run in Yan'an.  A group of young
research fellows from the Academy, led by Wang Shi-wei and including my
father, put up wall posters criticizing their leaders and demanding
more freedom and the right to greater individual expression.  Their
action caused a storm, and Mao himself came to read the posters.

Mao did not like what he saw, and turned his campaign into a
witch-hunt.  Wang Shi-wei was accused of being a Trotskyite and a spy.
My father, as the youngest person in the Academy, was said by Ai Si-qi,
the chief exponent of Marxism in China and one of the leaders of the
Academy, to have 'committed a very naive mistake."  Earlier, Ai Si-qi
had often praised my father as a 'brilliant and sharp mind."

My father and his friends were subjected to relentless criticisms and
obliged to undertake self-criticisms at intensive meetings for months.
They were told that they had caused chaos in Yan'an and weakened the
Party's unity and discipline, which could damage the great cause of
saving China from the Japanese and from poverty and injustice.  Over
and over again, the Party leaders inculcated into them the absolute
necessity for complete submission to the Party, for the good of the
cause.

The Academy was shut down, and my father was sent to teach ancient
Chinese history to semi-literate peasants turned-officials at the
Central Party School.  But the ordeal had turned him into a convert.
Like so many other young

people, he had invested his life and faith in Yan'an.  He could not let
himself be easily disappointed.  He regarded his harsh treatment as not
only justified, but even a noble experience soul-cleansing for the
mission to save China.

He believed that the only way this could be done was through
disciplined, perhaps drastic, measures, including immense personal
sacrifice and the total subordination of the self.

There were less demanding activities as well.  He toured the
surrounding areas collecting folk poetry, and learned to be a graceful
and elegant dancer in Western-style ballroom dancing, which was very
popular in Yan'an many of the Communist leaders, including the future
prime minister, Zhou Enlai, enjoyed it.  At the foot of the dry, dusty
hills was the meandering, dark-yellow, silt-filled Yan River, one of
the scores which join the majestic Yellow River, and here my father
often went swimming; he loved to do the backstroke while looking up at
the simple solid pagoda.

Life in Yan'an was hard but exhilarating.  In 1942, Chiang Kai-shek
6ghtened his blockade.  Supplies of food, clothing, and other
necessities became drastically curtailed.

Mao called on everyone to take up hoes and spinning wheels and produce
essential goods themselves.  My father became an excellent spinner.

He stayed in Yan'an for the whole of the war.  In spite of the
blockade, the Communists strengthened their control over large areas,
particularly in northern China, behind the Japanese lines.  Mao had
calculated well: the Communists had won vital breathing space.  By the
end of the war they claimed some sort of control over ninety-five
million people, about 20 percent of the population, in eighteen 'base
areas."  Equally important, they gained experience at running a
government and an economy under tough conditions.  This stood them in
good stead: their organizational ability and their system of control
were always phenomenal.

On 9 August 1945, Soviet troops swept into northeast

China.  Two days later the Chinese Communists offered them military
cooperation against the Japanese, but they were turned down: Stalin was
supporting Chiang Kaishek.  That same day the Chinese Communists
started to order armed units and political advisers into Manchuria,
which everyone realized was going to be of critical importance.

A month after the Japanese surrender my father was ordered to leave
Yan'an and head for a place called Chaoyang in southwest Manchuria,
about 700 miles to the east, near the border with Inner Mongolia.

In November, after walking for two months, my father and his small
group reached Chaoyang.  Most of the territory was barren hills and
mountains, almost as poor as Yan'an.  The area had been part of
Manchukuo until three months before.  A small group of local Communists
had proclaimed its own 'government."  The Kuomintang underground then
did the same.  Communist troops came racing over from Jinzhou, about
fifty miles away, arrested the Kuomintang governor, and executed him
for 'conspiring to overthrow the Communist government."

My father's group took over, with the authority of Yan'an, and within a
month a proper administration began to function for the whole area of
Chaoyang, which had a population of about 100,000.  My father became
its deputy chief.  One of the first acts of the new government was to
put up posters announcing its policies: the release of all prisoners;
the closure of all pawnshops pawned goods could be recovered free of
charge; brothels were to be closed and prostitutes given six months'
living allowance by their owners; all grain stores were to be opened
and the grain distributed to those most in need; all property belonging
to Japanese and collaborators was to be confiscated; and Chinese-owned
industry and commerce was to be protected.

These policies were enormously popular.  They benefited the poor, who
formed the vast majority of the population.  Chaoyang had never known
even moderately good government; it had been ransacked by different
armies in the warlord period, and then occupied and bled white by the
Japanese for over a decade.

A few weeks after my father had started his new job, Mao issued an
order to his forces to withdraw from all vulnerable cities and major
communication routes and to pull back into the countryside 'leaving the
high road alone and seizing the land on both sides' and 'surrounding
the cities from the countryside."  My father's unit withdrew from
Chaoyang into the mountains.  It was an area almost devoid of
vegetation, except for wild grass and the occasional hazelnut tree and
wild fruits.  The temperatures fell at night to around minus 30 F with
icy gales.  Anyone caught outside at night without cover froze to
death.  There was practically no food.  From the exhilaration of seeing
Japan's defeat and their own sudden expansion into large tracts of the
northeast, the Communists' apparent victory was seemingly turning to
ashes within weeks.  As my father and his men hunkered down in caves
and poor peasant huts, they were in a somber mood.

The Communists and the Kuomintang were both maneuvering for advantage
in preparation for a resumption of full-scale civil war.  Chiang
Kai-shek had moved his capital back to Nanjing, and with American help,
had transported large numbers of troops to North China, issuing secret
orders for them to occupy all strategic places as fast as possible. The
Americans sent a leading general, George Marshall, to China to try to
persuade Chiang to form a coalition government with the Communists as
junior partners.  A truce was signed on 10 January 1946, to go into
effect on 13 January.  On the 14th the Kuomintang entered Chaoyang and
immediately started setting up a large armed police force and an
intelligence network and arming local landlords' squads.  Altogether,
they put together a force of over 4,000 men to annihilate the
Communists in the area.

By February my father and his unit were on the run,

retreating deeper and deeper into more and more inhospitable terrain.
Most of the time they had to hide with the poorest peasants.  By April
there was nowhere left to run, and they had to break up into smaller
groups.  Guerrilla warfare was the only way to survive.  Eventually my
father set up his base at a place called Six Household Village, in
hilly country where the Xiaoling River starts, about sixty five miles
west of Jinzhou.

The guerrillas had very few arms; they had to obtain most of their guns
from the local police or 'borrow' them from landlord forces.  The other
main source was former members of the Manchukuo army and police, to
whom the Communists made a particular pitch because of their weapons
and fighting experience.  In my father's area, the main thrust of the
Communists' policy was to reduce the rent and interest on loans the
peasants had to pay to the landlords.  They also confiscated grain and
clothing from landlords and distributed them to the poor peasants.

At first progress was slow, but by July, when the sorghum had grown to
its full height ready for harvesting, and was high enough to conceal
them, the different guerrilla units were able to come together for a
meeting in Six Household Village, under a huge tree which stood guard
over the temple.  My father opened by referring to the Chinese Robin
Hood story, The Water Margin: "This is our "Hall of Justice."  We are
here to discuss how to "rid the people of evil and uphold justice on
behalf of Heaven."

At this point my father's guerrillas were fighting mainly westward, and
the areas they took included many villages inhabited by Mongolians.  In
November 1946, as winter closed in, the Kuomintang stepped up their
attacks.  One day my father was almost captured in an ambush.  After a
fierce firefight, he just managed to break out.  His clothes were torn
to shreds and his penis was dangling out of his trousers, to the
amusement of his comrades.

They rarely slept in the same place two nights running, and often had
to move several times in one night.  They could never take their
clothes off to sleep, and their life was an uninterrupted succession of
ambushes, encirclements, and breakouts.  There were a number of women
in the unit, and my father decided to move them and the wounded and
unfit to a more secure area to the south, near the Great Wall.  This
involved a long and hazardous journey through Kuomintang-held areas.
Any noise might be fatal, so my father ordered all babies to be left
behind with local peasants.  One woman could not bring herself to
abandon her child, and in the end my father told her she would have to
choose between leaving the baby behind or being court-martialed.  She
left the baby.

In the following months, my father's unit moved eastward toward Jinzhou
and the key railway line from Manchuria to China proper.  They fought
in the hills west of Jinzhou before the regular Communist army arrived.
The Kuomintang launched a number of unsuccessful 'annihilation
campaigns' against them.  The unit's actions began to have an impact.
My father, now twenty-five, was so well known that there was a price on
his head and "Wanted' notices up all over the Jinzhou area.  My mother
saw these notices, and began to hear a lot about him and his guerrillas
from her relatives in Kuomintang intelligence.

When my father's unit was forced to withdraw, Kuomintang forces
returned and took back from the peasants the food and clothing which
the Communists had confiscated from the landlords.  In many cases
peasants were tortured, and some were killed, particularly those who
had eaten the food which they had often done because they were starving
and could not now hand it back.

In SIX Household Village the man who had owned the most land, one Jin
Ting-quan, had also been the police chief, and had brutally raped many
local women.  He had run away with the Kuomintang and my father's unit
had presided over the meeting which opened his house and his grain
store.  When Jin came back with the Kuomintang the peasants were made
to grovel in front of him and return all the goods they had been given
by the Communists.

Those who had eaten the food were tortured and their homes smashed. One
man who refused to kowtow or return the food was slowly burned to
death.

In spring 1947 the tide began to turn, and in March my father's group
was able to retake the town of Chaoyang.

Soon the whole surrounding area was in their hands.  To celebrate their
victory, there was a feast followed by entertainment.  My father was
brilliant at inventing riddles out of people's names, which made him a
great hit with his comrades.

The Communists carried out a land reform, confiscating land which had
hitherto been owned by a small number of landlords and redistributing
it equally among the peasants.

In Six Household Village the peasants at first refused to take Jin
Ting-quan's land, even though he had now been arrested.  Although he
was under guard, they bowed and scraped to him.  My father visited many
peasant families, and gradually learned the horrible truth about him.
The Chaoyang government sentenced Jin to death by shooting, but the
family of the man who had been burned to death, with the support of the
families of other victims, determined to kill him the same way.  As the
flames began to lick around his body Jin clenched his teeth, and did
not utter even a moan until the moment the fire surrounded his heart.
The Communist officials sent to carry out the execution did not prevent
the villagers (from doing this.

Although the Communists were opposed to torture in theory and on
principle, officials were told that they should not intervene if the
peasants wished to vent their anger in passionate acts of revenge.

People such as Jin were not just wealthy owners of land, but had
wielded absolute and arbitrary power, which they indulged willfully,
over the lives of the local population.

They were called e-ba ('ferocious despots').

In some areas the killing extended to ordinary landlords, who were
called 'stones' obstacles to the revolution.

Policy toward the 'stones' was: "When in doubt, kill."  My father
thought this was wrong and told his subordinates, and the people at
public meetings, that only those who unquestionably had blood on their
hands should be sentenced to death.  In his reports to his superiors he
repeatedly said that the Party should be careful with human lives, and
that excessive executions would only harm the revolution.  It was
partly because many people like my father spoke up that in February
1948 the Communist leadership issued urgent instructions to stop
violent excesses.

All the time, the main forces of the Communist army were coming nearer.
In early 1948 my father's guerrillas joined up with the regular army.
He was put in charge of an intelligence-gathering system covering the
JinzhouHuludao area; his job was to track the deployment of Kuomintang
forces and monitor their food situation.  Much of his information came
from agents inside the Kuomintang, including Yu-wu.  From these reports
he heard of my mother for the first time.

The thin, dreamy-looking man my mother saw brushing his teeth in the
courtyard that October morning was known among his fellow guerrillas
for his fastidiousness.  He brushed his teeth every day, which was a
novelty to the other guerrillas and to the peasants in the villages he
had fought through.  Unlike everyone else, who simply blew their noses
onto the ground, he used a handkerchief, which he washed whenever he
could.  He never dipped his face towel in the public washbasin like the
other soldiers, as eye diseases were widespread.  He was also known as
scholarly and bookish and always carried some volumes of classical
poetry with him, even in battle.

When she had first seen the "Wanted' posters and heard about this
dangerous 'bandit' from her relatives, my mother could tell that they
admired as well as feared him.  Now she was not a bit disappointed that
the legendary guerrilla did not look at all warrior like

My father also knew of my mother's courage and, most unusual of all,
the fact that she, a seventeen-year-old girl, was giving orders to men.
An admirable and emancipated woman, he had thought, although he had
also imagined her as a fierce dragon.  To his delight he found her
pretty and feminine, even rather coquettish.  She was both soft spoken
and persuasive and also, something rare in China, precise.  This was an
extremely important quality for him, as he hated the traditional
florid, irresponsible, and vague way of talking.

She noticed that he laughed a lot, and that he had shiny white teeth,
unlike most other guerrillas, whose teeth were often brown and rotting.
She was also attracted by his conversation.  He struck her as learned
and knowledgeable definitely not the sort of man who would mix up
Flaubert and Maupassant.

When my mother told him she was there to report on the work of her
students' union, he asked her what books the students were reading.  My
mother gave him a list and asked if he would come and give them some
lectures on Marxist philosophy and history.  He agreed, and asked her
how many people there were at her school.  She gave him an exact figure
at once.  Then he asked her what proportion of them backed the
Communists; again she immediately gave him a careful estimate.

A few days later he turned up to start his course of lectures.  He also
took the students through Mao's works and explained what some of Mao's
basic theories were.  He was an excellent speaker, and the girls,
including my mother, were bowled over.

One day, he told the students that the Party was organizing a trip to
Harbin, the Communists' temporary capital in the north of Manchuria.
Harbin was largely built by Russians and was known as 'the Paris of the
East' because of its broad boulevards, ornate buildings, smart shops,
and European-style cafes.  The trip was presented as a sight seeing
tour, but the real reason for it was that the Party

was worried that the Kuomintang was going to try to retake Jinzhou, and
they wanted to get the pro-Communist teachers and students, as well as
the professional elite like doctors, out in case the city was
reoccupied but they did not want to set off alarm bells by saying so. 
My mother and a number of her friends were among the 170 people chosen
to go.

In late November my mother set off by train for the north in a state of
high excitement.  It was in snow-covered Harbin, with its romantic old
buildings and its Russian mood of lingering pensiveness and poetry,
that my parents fell in love.  My father wrote some beautiful poems for
my mother there.  Not only were they in very elegant classical style,
which was a considerable accomplishment, but she discovered that he was
a good calligrapher, which raised him even higher in her esteem.

On New Year's Eve he invited my mother and a girlfriend of hers to his
quarters.  He was living in an old Russian hotel, which was like
something out of a fairy tale, with a brightly colored roof, ornate
gables, and delicate plaster work around the windows and on the
veranda.

When my mother came in, she saw a bottle sitting on a rococo table; it
had foreign lettering on it champagne.

My father had never actually drunk champagne before; he had only read
about it in foreign books.

By this time it was well known among my mother's fellow students that
the two were in love.  My mother, being the student leader, often went
to give long reports to my father, and it was noticed that she did not
come back until the small hours.  My father had several other admirers,
including the friend who was with my mother that night, but she could
see from how he looked at my mother, his teasing remarks and the way
they seized every chance to be physically close to each other, that he
was in love with her.

When the friend left toward midnight, she knew my mother was going to
stay behind.  My father found a note under the empty champagne bottle:
"Alas!  I shall have no more reason to drink champagne!  I hope the
champagne bottle is always full for you!"

That night, my father asked my mother whether she was committed to
anyone else.  She told him about her previous relationships, and said
the only man she had really loved was her cousin Hu, but that he had
been executed by the Kuomintang.  Then, in line with the new Communist
moral code which, in a radical departure from the past, enjoined that
men and women should be equal, he told her about his previous
relationships.  He said he had been in love with a woman in Yibin, but
that that had ended when he left for Yan'an.  He had had a few
girlfriends in Yan'an, and in his guerrilla days, but the war had made
it impossible even to contemplate the idea of marriage.  One of his
former girlfriends was to marry Chen Boda, the head of my father's
section of the Academy in Yan'an, who later rose to enormous power as
Mao's secretary.

After hearing each other's frank accounts of their past lives, my
father said he was going to write to the Jinzhou City Party Committee
asking for permission to 'talk about love' (tan-lian-ai) with my
mother, with a view to marriage.

This was the obligatory procedure.  My mother supposed it was a bit
like asking permission from the head of the family, and in fact that is
exactly what it was: the Communist Party was the new patriarch.  That
night, after their talk, my mother received her first present from my
father, a romantic Russian novel called It's Only Love.

The next day my mother wrote home saying she had met a man she liked
very much.  The immediate reaction of her mother and Dr.  Xia was not
enthusiasm but concern, because my father was an official, and
officials had always had a bad name among ordinary Chinese.  Apart from
their other vices, their arbitrary power meant they were thought
unlikely to treat women decently.  My grandmother's immediate
assumption was that my father was married already and wanted my mother
as a concubine.  After all, he was well beyond the marrying age for men
in Manchuria.

After about a month it was judged safe for the Harbin group to return
to Jinzhou.  The Party told my father that he had permission to 'talk
about love' with my mother.

Two other men had also applied, but their applications came too late.
One of them was Liang, who had been her controller in the underground.
In his disappointment he asked to be transferred away from Jinzhou.
Neither he nor the other man had breathed a word of their intentions to
my mother.

My father got back to be told he had been appointed head of the Public
Affairs Department ofJinzhou.  A few days later my mother took him home
to introduce him to her family.  The moment he came in the door my
grandmother turned her back on him, and when he tried to greet her she
refused to answer.  My father was dark and terribly thin the result of
the hardships he had been through in the guerrilla days, and my
grandmother was convinced he was well over forty, and therefore that it
was impossible he had not been married before.  Dr.  Xia treated him
politely, if formally.

My father did not stay long.  When he left, my grandmother was in
floods of tears.  No official could be any good, she cried.  But Dr.
Xia already realized, through meeting my father and from my mother's
explanations, that the Communists exercised such tight control over
their people that an official like my father would not be able to
cheat.  My grandmother was only half reassured: "But he is from
Sichuan.  How can the Communists find out when he comes from so far
away?"

She kept up her barrage of doubts and criticism, but the rest of the
family took to my father.  Dr.  Xia got on very well with him, and they
would talk together for hours.

Yu-lin and his wife also liked him very much.  Yu-lin's wife had come
from a very poor family.  Her mother had been forced into an unhappy
marriage after her grandfather had staked her in a card game and lost.
Her brother had been caught in a roundup by the Japanese and had had to
do
three years of forced labor, which destroyed
his body.

From the day she married Yu-lin, she had to get up at three o'clock
every morning to start preparing the various different meals demanded
by the complicated Manchu tradition.  My grandmother was running the
house and, although they were in theory members of the same generation,
Yu-lin's wife felt that she was the inferior because she and her
husband were dependent on the Xias.  My father was the first person to
make a point of treating her as an equal, which in China was a
considerable departure from the past, and several times he gave the
couple film tickets, which for them was a big treat.  He was the first
official they had ever met who did not put on airs, and Yu-lin's wife
certainly felt that the Communists were a big improvement.

Less than two months after returning from Harbin my mother and father
filed their application.  Marriage had traditionally been a contract
between families, and there had never been civil registration or a
marriage certificate.

Now, for those who had 'joined the revolution," the Party functioned as
the family head.  Its criteria were '28-7-regiment-l' which meant that
the man had to be at least twenty-eight years old, a Party member for
at least seven years, and with a rank equivalent to that of a
regimental commander; the '1' referred to the only qualification the
woman had to meet, to have worked for the Party for a minimum of one
year.  My father was twenty-eight according to the Chinese way of
counting age (one year old at birth), he had been a Party member for
over ten years, and he held a position equivalent to that of a deputy
division commander.  Although my mother was not a member of the Party,
her work for the underground was accepted as meeting the '1' criterion,
and since she had come back from Harbin she had been working full time
for an organization called the Women's Federation, which dealt with
women's affairs: it supervised the freeing of concubines and shutting
down brothels, mobilized women to make shoes for the army, organized
their education and their employment, informed them of their rights,
and helped ensure that women were not entering into marriages against
their wishes.

The Women's Federation was now my mother's 'work unit' (dan-weO, an
institution wholly under the control of the Party, to which everyone in
the urban areas had to belong and which regulated virtually every
aspect of an employee's life like in an army.  My mother was supposed
to live on the premises of the Federation, and had to obtain its
permission to marry.  The Federation left it up to my father's work
unit, as he was a higher official.  The Jinzhou City Party Committee
speedily gave its written permission, but because of my father's
position, clearance also had to come from the Party Committee for the
province of West Liaoning.  Assuming there would be no problem, my
parents set the wedding day for 4 May, my mother's eighteenth
birthday.

On that day my mother wrapped up her bedroll and her clothes and got
ready to move into my father's quarters.

She wore her favorite pale blue gown and a white silk scarf.

My grandmother was appalled.  It was unheard of for a bride to walk to
the bridegroom's house.  The man had to get a sedan chair to carry her
over.  For a woman to walk was a sign that she was worthless and that
the man did not really want her.

"Who cares about all that stuff now?"  said my mother as she tied up
her bedroll.  But my grandmother was more dismayed at the thought that
her daughter was not going to have a magnificent traditional wedding.
From the moment a baby girl was born, her mother would start putting
things aside for her dowry.  Following the custom, my mother's
trousseau contained a dozen satin-covered quilts and pillows with
embroidered mandarin ducks, as well as curtains and a decorated pelmet
for a four-poster bed.  But my mother regarded a traditional ceremony
as old-fashioned and redundant.  Both she and my father wanted to get
rid of rituals like that, which they felt had nothing to do with their
feelings.  Love was the only thing that mattered to these two
revolutionaries.

My mother walked, carrying her bedroll, to my father's quarters.  Like
all officials, he was living in the building where he worked, the City
Party Committee; the employees were housed in rows of bungalows with
sliding doors situated around a big courtyard.  As dusk fell, and they
were on the point of going to bed for the night, my mother was kneeling
down to take off my father's slippers when there was a knock on the
door.  A man was standing there, and he handed my father a message from
the Provincial Party Committee.  It said they could not get married
yet.  Only the tightening of my mother's lips showed how unhappy she
was.  She just bent her head, silently gathered up her bedroll, and
left with a simple "See you later."  There were no tears, no scene, not
even any visible anger.  The moment was etched indelibly into my
father's mind.  When I was a child he used to say: "Your mother was so
graceful."

Then, jokingly, "How times have changed!  You're not like your mother!
You wouldn't do something like that kneel down to take off a man's
shoes!"

What had caused the delay was that the Provincial Committee was
suspicious of my mother because of her family connections.  They
questioned her in great detail about how her family had come to be
connected with Kuomintang intelligence.  They told her she must be
completely truthful.  It was like giving evidence in court.

She also had to explain how each of the Kuomintang officers had sought
her hand, and why she was friends with so many Kuomintang Youth League
members.  She pointed out that her friends were the most anti-Japanese
and the most socially conscious people; and that when the

Kuomintang had come to Jinzhou in 1945, they had seen it as the
government of China.  She herself might well have joined, but at
fourteen she was too young.  In fact, most of her friends had soon
switched to the Communists.

The Party was divided: the City Committee took the view that my
mother's friends had acted out of pamofic motives; but some of the
provincial leaders treated them with open-ended suspicion.  My mother
was asked to 'draw a line' between herself and her friends.

"Drawing a line' between people was a key mechanism the Communists
introduced to increase the gap between those who were 'in' and those
who were 'out."  Nothing, even personal relationships, was left to
chance, or allowed to be fluid.  If she wanted to get married, she had
to stop seeing her friends.

But the most painful thing for my mother was what was happening to
Hui-ge, the young Kuomintang colonel.  The moment the siege was over,
after her initial exhilaration that the Communists had won, her
strongest urge had been to see whether he was all right.  She ran all
the way through the blood-soaked streets to the Jis' mansion.  There
was nothing there no street, no houses, only a gigantic pile of rubble.
Hui-ge had disappeared.

In the spring, just as she was preparing to get married, she found out
that he was alive, a prisoner- and inJinzhou.

At the time of the siege he had managed to escape south and had ended
up at Tianjin; when the Communists took Tianjin in January 1949, he was
captured and brought back.

Hui-ge was not regarded as an ordinary prisoner of war.

Because of his family's influence in Jinzhou, he fell into the category
of' snakes in their old haunts," meaning established powerful local
figures.  They were especially dangerous for the Communists because
they commanded loyalty from the local population, and their
anti-Communist inclinations posed a threat to the new regime.

My mother felt confident that Hui-ge would be fairly treated after it
was known what he had done, and she immediately started to appeal on
his behalfi As was the procedure, she had to talk first to her
immediate boss in her unit, the Women's Federation, which forwarded the
appeal to a higher authority.  My mother did not know who had the final
say.  She went to Yu-wu, who knew about, and indeed had instructed, her
contact with Hui-ge, and asked him to vouch for the colonel.  Yu-wu
wrote a report describing what Hui-ge had done, but added that he had
perhaps acted out of love for my mother, and that he might not even
have known he was helping the Communists because he was blinded by
love.

My mother went to another underground leader who knew what the colonel
had done.  He too refused to say that Hui-ge had been helping the
Communists.  In fact he was not willing to mention the co loners role
in getting information out to the Communists at all, so that he could
take full credit for it himself.  My mother said that she and the
colonel had not been in love, but she could not produce any proof.  She
cited the veiled requests and promises that had passed between them,
but these were regarded only as evidence that the colonel was trying to
buy 'insurance," something about which the Party was particularly
chary.

All this was going on at the time that my mother and father were
preparing to get married, and it cast a dark shadow over their
relationship.  However, my father sympathized with my mother's
quandary, and thought Hui-ge should be treated fairly.  He did not let
the fact that my grandmother had favored the colonel as her son-in-law
influence his judgment.

In late May, permission finally arrived for the wedding to go ahead. My
mother was at a meeting of the Women's Federation when someone came in
and slipped a note into her hand.  The note was from the city Party
chief, Lin Xiao-xia, who was a nephew of the top general who had led
the Communist forces in Manchuria, Lin Biao.  It was in verse, and said
sun ply "The provincial authorities have given the okay.  You can't
possibly want to be stuck in a meeting.  Come quickly and get
married!"

My mother tried to look calm as she walked up and gave the note to the
woman presiding over the meeting, who nodded approval for her to leave.
She ran all the way to

A Revolutionary Mannage 17 7 my father's quarters, still wearing her
blue "Lenin suit," a uniform for government employees that had a
doublebreasted jacket tucked in at the waist and worn over bag~
trousers.  When she opened the door, she saw Lin Xiao-xia and the other
Party leaders and their bodyguards, who had just arrived.  My father
said a carriage had been sent for Dr.  Xia.  Lin asked: "What about
your mother-in-law?"  My father said nothing.

"That's not right," Lin said, and ordered a carriage to be sent for
her.  My mother felt very hurt, but attributed my father's action to
his loathing of my grandmother's Kuomintang intelligence connections.
Still, she thought, was that her mother's fault?  It did not occur to
her that my father's behavior might have been a reaction to the way her
mother had treated him.

There was no wedding ceremony of any kind, only a small gathering.  Dr.
Xia came up to congratulate the couple.  Everyone sat around for a
while eating fresh crabs which the City Party Committee had provided as
a special treat.  The Communists were trying to institute a frugal
approach to weddings, which had traditionally been the occasion for
huge expenditure, far out of proportion to what people could afford. It
was not at all unusual for families to bankrupt themselves to put on a
lavish wedding.

My parents had dates and peanuts, which had been served at weddings in
Yan'an, and dried fruit called long an which traditionally symbolizes a
happy union and sons.  After a short time, Dr.  Xia and most of the
guests left.  A group from the Women's Federation turned up late',
after their meeting was over.

Dr.  Xia and my grandmother had had no idea about the wedding, nor did
the first carriage driver tell them.  My grandmother only heard that
her daughter was about to be married when the second carriage came.  As
she hurried up the path and came into view through the window, the
women from the Federation started whispering to each other and then
scut fled out the back door.  My father left as well.  My mother was on
the verge of tears.  She knew the women from her group despised my
grandmother not only because of her Kuomintang connections but also
because she had been a concubine.  Far from being emancipated on these
issues, many Communist women from uneducated peasant backgrounds were
set in their traditional ways.  For them, no good gift would have
become a concubine even though the Communists had stipulated that a
concubine enjoyed the same status as a wife, and could dissolve the
'marriage' unilaterally.  These women from the Federation were the very
ones supposed to be implementing the Party's policies of
emancipation.

My mother covered up, telling her mother that her bridegroom had had to
go back to work: "It is not the Communist custom to give people leave
for a wedding.  In fact, I am about to go back to work myself."  My
grandmother thought that the offhand way in which the Communists
treated a big thing like a wedding was absolutely extraordinary, but
they had broken so many rules relating to traditional values, maybe
this was just one more.

At the time one of my mother's jobs was teaching reading and writing to
the women in the textile factory where she had worked under the
Japanese, and informing them about women's equality with men.  The
factory was still privately owned, and one of the foremen was still
beating women employees whenever he felt like it.  My mother was
instrumental in getting him sacked, and helped the women workers elect
their own forewoman.  But any credit she might have ?eceived for
achieving this was obscured by the Federation's dissatisfaction about
another matter.

One major task of the Women's Federation was to make cotton shoes for
the army.  My mother did not know how to make shoes, so she got her
mother and aunts to do it.

They had been brought up making elaborate embroidered shoes, and my
mother proudly presented the Women's Federation with a large number of
beautifully made shoes, far exceeding her quota.  To her surprise,
instead of being praised for her ingenuity, she was scolded like a
child.  The peasant women in the Federation could not conceive that
there could be a woman on the face of the earth who did not know how to
make shoes.  It was like saying someone did not know how to eat.  She
was criticized at the Federation meetings for her 'bourgeois
decadence."

My mother did not get on with some of her bosses in the Women's
Federation.  They were older, and conservative, peasant women who had
slogged for years with the guerrillas, and they resented pretty,
educated city girls like my mother who immediately attracted the
Communist men.

My mother had applied to join the Party, but they said that she was
unworthy.

Every time she went home she found herself being criticized.  She was
accused of being 'too attached to her family," which was condemned as a
'bourgeois habit," and had to see less and less of her own mother.

At the time there was an unwritten rule that no revolutionary could
spend the night away from his or her office except on Saturdays.  My
mother's assigned sleeping place was in the Women's Federation, which
was separated from my father's quarters by a low mud wall.  At night
she would clamber over the wall and cross a small garden to my father's
room, returning to her own room before dawn.

She was soon found out, and she and my father were criticized at Party
meetings.  The Communists had embarked on a radical reorganization not
just of institutions, but of people's lives, especially the lives of
those who had 'joined the revolution."  The idea was that everything
personal was political; in fact, henceforth nothing was supposed to be
regarded as 'personal' or private.  Pettiness was validated by being
labeled 'political," and meetings became the forum by which the
Communists channeled all sorts of personal animosities.

My father had to make a verbal self-criticism, and my mother a written
one.  She was said to have 'put love first," when revolution should
have had priority.  She felt very wronged.  What harm could it do the
revolution if she spent the night with her husband?  She could
understand the rationale for such a rule in the guerrilla days, but not
now.

She did not want to write a self-criticism, and told my father so.  To
her dismay he admonished her, saying: "The revolution is not won.  The
war is still going on.  We have broken the rules, and we should admit
mistakes.  A revolution needs steel-like discipline.  You have to obey
the Party even if you do not understand it or agree with it."

Soon after this disaster struck out of the blue.  A poet called Bian,
who had been in the delegation to Harbin and who had become a close
friend of my mother, tried to kill himself.  Bian was a follower of the
"New Moon' school of poetry, a leading exponent of which was Hu Shi,
who became Kuomintang ambassador to the.  United States.  It
concentrated on aesthetics and form and was~ particularly influenced by
Keats.  Bian had joined the Communists during the war, but then found
that his poetry was deemed not to be in harmony with the revolution,
which wanted propaganda, not self-expression.  He accepted this with
part of his mind, but he was also very torn and depressed.

He began to feel that he would never be able to write again, and yet,
he said, he could not live without his poetry.

His attempted suicide shocked the Party.  It was bad for its image for
people to think that anyone might be so disillusioned with Liberation
that they would try to kill themselves.  Bian was working in Jinzhou as
a teacher at the school for Party officials, many of whom were
illiterate.

The Party organization at the school conducted an investigation and
leapt to the conclusion that Bian had tried to kill himself because of
unrequited love for my mother.

In its criticism meetings the Women's Federation suggested that my
mother had led Bian on and then ditched him for a bigger prize, my
father.  My mother was furious, and demanded to see the evidence for
the accusation.  Of course, none was ever produced.

In this case, my father stood by my mother.  He knew that on the trip
to Harbin, when my mother was supposed

to have been having trysts with Bian, she had been in love with him,
not the poet.  He had seen Bian reading his poems to my mother and knew
that my mother admired him, and did not think there was anything wrong
with it.

But neither he nor my mother could stop the flood of gossip.  The women
in the Federation were particularly virulent.

At the height of this whispering campaign my mother heard that her
appeal for Hui-ge had been turned down.

She was beside herself with anguish.  She had made a promise to Hui-ge,
and now she felt that she had somehow misled him.  She had been
visiting him regularly in prison, bringing him news of her efforts to
get his case reviewed, and she had felt it was inconceivable that the
Communists would not spare him.  She had been genuinely optimistic and
had tried to cheer him up.  But this time when he saw her face,
red-eyed and distorted from the effort of hiding her despair, he knew
there was no hope.  They wept together, sitting in full view of the
guards with a table between them on which they had to place their
hands.

Hui-ge took my mother's hands in his; she did not pull back.

My father was informed of my mother's visits to the prison.  At first
he said nothing.  He sympathized with her predicament.  But gradually
he became angry.  The scandal about Bian's attempted suicide was at its
height, and now it was alleged that his wife had had a relationship
with a Kuomintang colonel and they were still supposed to be on their
honeymoon!  He was furious, but his personal feelings were not the
decisive factor in his acceptance of the Party's attitude toward the
colonel.  He told my mother that if the Kuomintang came back people
like Hui-ge would be the first to use their authority to help restore
it to power.  The Communists, he said, could not afford that risk: "Our
revolution is a matter of life and death."  When my mother tried to
tell him how Hui-ge had helped the Communists he responded that her
visits to the prison had
done Hui-ge no good,
particularly their holding hands.

Since the time of Confucius, men and women had to be married, or at
least lovers, to touch in public, and even under these circumstances it
was extremely rare.  The fact that my mother and Hui-ge had been seen
holding hands was taken as proof that they had been in love, and that
Hui-ge's service to the Communists had not been motivated by 'correct'
reasons.  My mother found it hard to disagree with him, but this did
not make her feel any less desolate.

Her sense of being caught up in impossible dilemmas was heightened by
what was happening to several of her relatives and many people close to
her.  When the Communists arrived, they had announced that anybody who
had worked for Kuomintang intelligence had to report to them at once.
Her uncle Yu-lin had never worked in intelligence, but he had an
intelligence card, and felt he should report to the new authorities.
His wife and my grandmother tried to dissuade him, but he thought it
best to tell the truth.

He was in a difficult situation.  If he had not turned himself in and
the Communists had discovered the facts about him, which was highly
likely, given their formidable organization, he would have been in dire
trouble.  But by coming forward, he himself had given them grounds to
suspect him.

The Party's verdict was: "Has a political blemish in his past.  No
punishment, but can only be employed under control."  This verdict,
like almost all others, was not delivered by a court, but by a Party
body.  There was no clear definition of what it meant, but as a result
of it, for three decades Yu-lin's life would depend on the political
climate and on his Party bosses.  In those days Jinzhou had a
relatively relaxed City Party Committee, and he was allowed to go on
helping Dr.  Xia in the shop.

My grandmother's brother-in-law, "Loyalty' Pei-o, was exiled to the
country to do manual labor.  Because he had no blood on his hands, he
was given a sentence called

'under surveillance."  Instead of being imprisoned, this meant being
guarded (just as effectively) in society.  His family chose to go to
the country with him, but before they could leave, "Loyalty' had to
enter a hospital.  He had contracted venereal disease.  The Communists
had launched a major campaign to wipe out VD, and anyone who had it was
obliged to undergo treatment.

His work 'under surveillance' lasted three years.  It was rather like
assigned labor under parole.  People under surveillance enjoyed a
measure of freedom, but they had to report to the police at regular
intervals with a detailed account of everything they had done, or even
thought, since their last visit, and they were openly watched by the
police.

When they finished their term of formal surveillance, they would join
people like Yu-lin in a looser category of 'quiet' surveillance.  One
common form of this was the 'sandwich' being kept under close watch by
two neighbors who had been specifically assigned this task, often
called 'two reds sandwiching a black."  Of course, other neighbors,
through the residents' committees, were also entitled and encouraged to
report and inform on the unreliable 'black."  The 'people's justice'
was watertight, and was a central instrument of rule because it
enlisted so many citizens in active collusion with the state.

Zhu-ge, the scholarly looking intelligence officer who had married Miss
Tanaka, my mother's Japanese teacher, was sentenced to forced labor for
life and exiled to a remote border area (along with many former
Kuomintang officials, he was released in an amnesty in 1959).  His wife
was sent back to Japan.  As in the Soviet Union, almost all of those
sentenced to detention did not go to prison but into labor camps, often
working in dangerous jobs or highly polluted areas.

Some important Kuomintang figures, including intelligence men, went
unpunished.  The academic supervisor at my mother's school had been
district secretary of the Kuomintang, but there was evidence that he
had helped to save the lives of many Communists and Communist
sympathizers, including my mother, so he was spared.

The headmistress and two teachers who had worked for intelligence
managed to hide, and eventually escaped to Taiwan.  So did Yao-han, the
political supervisor who had been responsible for my mother's arrest.

The Communists also spared big shots like the 'last emperor," Pu Yi,
and top generals because they were 'useful."  Mao's stated policy was:
"We kill small Chiang Kaiosheks.  We don't kill big Chiang Kai-she ks
Keeping people like Pu Yi alive, he reasoned, would 'be well received
abroad."  No one could complain openly about this policy, but it was a
cause of much discontent in private.

It was a time of great anxiety for my mother's family.

Her uncle Yu-lin and her aunt Lan, whose fate was hitched inexorably to
that of her husband, "Loyalty," were in a state of acute uncertainty
about their futures, and suffering ostracism.  But the Women's
Federation ordered my mother to write one self-criticism after another,
as her grief indicated she had 'a soft spot for the Kuomintang."

She was also sniped at for visiting a prisoner, Hui-ge, without asking
for permission from the Federation first.

Nobody had told her she was supposed to do this.  The Federation said
that they had not stopped her before because they made allowances for
someone who was 'new to the revolution'; they were waiting to see how
long it would take her to reach her own sense of discipline and ask the
Party for instructions.

"But what are the things for which I need to apply for instructions?"
she asked.

"Anything," was the answer.  The need to obtain authorization for an
unspecified 'anything' was to become a fundamental element in Chinese
Communist rule.  It also meant that people learned not to take any
action on their own initiative.

My mother became ostracized within the Federation, which was her whole
world.  There were whispers that she had been used by Hui-ge to help
him prepare for a comeback.

"What a mess she got herself into," exclaimed the women, 'all because
she was "loose."  Look at all these involvements with men!  And what
kind of men!"  My mother felt surrounded by accusing fingers, and that
the people who were supposed to be her comrades in a glorious new and
liberating movement were questioning her character and her commitment,
for which she had risked her life.

She was even criticized for having left the meeting of the Women's
Federation to go and get married a sin termed 'putting love first."  My
mother said that the city chief had asked her to go.  To this the
chairwoman retorted: "But it was up to you to show your correct
attitude by putting the meeting first."

Just eighteen, recently married, and full of hope for a new life, my
mother felt miserably confused and isolated.

She had always trusted her own strong sense of right and wrong, but
this now seemed to be in conflict with the views of her 'cause' and,
often, the judgment of her husband, whom she loved.  She began to doubt
herself for the first time.

She did not blame the Party, or the revolution.  Nor could she blame
the women in the Federation, because they were her comrades and seemed
to be the voice of the Party.  Her resentment turned against my father.
She felt that his loyalty was not primarily to her and that he always
seemed to side with his comrades against her.  She understood that it
might be difficult for him to express his support in public, but she
wanted it in private and she did not get it.  From the very beginning
of their marriage, there was a fundamental difference between my
parents.  My father's devotion to communism was absolute: he felt he
had to speak the same language in private, even to his wife, that he
did in public.  My mother was much more flexible;

her commitment was tempered by both reason and emotion.  She gave a
space to the private; my father did not.

My mother was finding Jinzhou unbearable.  She told my father she
wanted to leave, right away.  He agreed, in spite of the fact that he
was just about to receive a promotion.  He applied to the City Party
Committee for a transfer, giving as the reason that he wanted to go
back to his hometown, Yibin.  The Committee was surprised, as he had
just told them this was exactly what he did not want to do.  Throughout
Chinese history, it had been a rule that officials were stationed away
from their hometowns to avoid problems of nepotism.

In the summer of 1949 the Communists were advancing southward with
unstoppable momentum: they had captured Chiang Kai-shek's capital,
Nanjing, and seemed certain to reach Sichuan soon.  Their experience in
Manchuria had shown them that they badly needed administrators who were
local and loyal.

The Party endorsed my father's transfer.  Two months after their
marriage and less than one year after Liberation they were being driven
out of my mother's hometown by gossip and spite.  My mother's joy at
Liberation had turned to an anxious melancholy.  Under the Kuomintang
she had been able to discharge her tension in action and it had been
easy to feel she was doing the right thing, which gave her courage. Now
she just felt in the wrong all the time.  When she tried to talk it
over with my father he would tell her that becoming a Communist was an
agonizing process.  That was the way it had to be.

7. "Going through the Five Mountain Passes' My Mothefts Long March

(1949-1950)

Just before my parents left Jinzhou, my mother was granted provisional
membership in the Party, thanks to the deputy mayor who oversaw the
Women's Federation, who argued that she needed it because she was going
to a new place.

The decision meant she could become a full member in one year's time,
if she was deemed to have proved herself worthy.

My parents were to join a group of over a hundred people traveling to
the southwest, most of them to Sichuan.

The bulk of the group were men, Communist officials from the southwest.
The few women were Manchurians who had married Sichuanese.  For the
journey they were organized into units and given green army uniforms.
The civil war was still raging in their path.

On 27 July 1949 my grandmother, Dr.  Xia, and my mother's closest
friends, most of whom were under suspicion from the Communists, came to
the station to see them off.  As they stood on the platform saying
goodbye, my mother felt torn by contradictory feelings.  With one
part of her heart she felt
like a bird which was now going to burst out of its cage and fly to the
sky.  With the other part she wondered when or if- she would ever see
these people she loved, particularly her mother, again.  The journey
was fraught with danger, and Sichuan was still in the hands of the
Kuomintang.  It was also 1,000 miles away, inconceivably far, and she
had no idea if she would ever be able to get back to Jinzhou.  She felt
an overwhelming desire to cry, but she held back her tears because she
did not want to make her mother sadder than she already was.

As the platform slipped out of sight my father tried to comfort her. He
told her that she must be strong, and that as a young student 'joining
the revolution' she needed to 'go through the five mountain passes'
which meant adopting a completely new attitude to family, profession,
love, life-style, and manual labor, through embracing hardship and
trauma.  The Party's theory was that educated people like her needed to
stop being 'bourgeois' and become closer to the peasants, who formed
over 8o percent of the population.  My mother had heard these theories
a hundred times.  She accepted the need to reform oneself for a new
China; in fact she had just written a poem about meeting the challenge
of 'the storm of sand' in her future.  But she also wanted more
tenderness and personal understanding, and she resented the fact that
she did not get them from my father.

When the train reached Tianjin, about z5o miles to the southwest, they
had to stop because the line ended.  My father said he would like to
take her around the city.  Tianjin was a huge port where the United
States, Japan, and a number of European states had until recently had
'concessions," extraterritorial enclaves (General Xue had died in the
French concession in Tianjin, although my mother did not know this).
There were whole quarters built in different foreign styles, with
grandiose buildings: elegant turn-of-the-century French palaces; light
Italian pa lazzi

overblown, late rococo Austro-Hungarian townhouses.  It

My Mother's Long March ~ 89 was an extraordinary condensation of
display by eight different nations, all of whom had been trying to
impress one another and the Chinese.  Apart from the squat, heaD', gray
Japanese banks, familiar from Manchuria, and the green-roofed Russian
banks, with their delicate pink-and yellow walls, it was the first time
my mother had ever seen buildings like these.  My father had read a lot
of foreign literature, and the descriptions of European buildings had
always fascinated him.  This was the first time he had seen them with
his own eyes.  My mother could tell he was going to a lot of trouble to
try to fire her with his enthusiasm, but she was still down in the
dumps as they strolled along the streets, which were lined with heavily
scented Chinese scholar trees.  She was already missing her mother, and
she could not rid herself of her anger against my father for not saying
anything sympathetic, and for his stiffness, although she knew he was
trying, awkwardly, to help her out of her mood.

The broken railway line was only the beginning.  They had to continue
their journey on foot, and the route was peppered with local landlords'
forces, bandits, and units of Kuomintang soldiers who had been left
behind as the Communists advanced.  There were only three rifles in the
entire group, one of which my father had, but at each stage along the
route the local authorities sent a squad of soldiers as an escort,
usually with a couple of machine guns.

They had to walk long distances every day, often on rough paths,
carrying their bedrolls and other belongings on their backs.  Those who
had been in the guerrillas were used to this, but after one day the
soles of my mother's feet were covered with blisters.  There was no way
she could stop for a rest.  Her colleagues advised her to soak her feet
in hot water at the end of the day and to let the fluid out by piercing
the blisters with a needle and a hair.

This brought instant relief, but the next day it was laceratingly
painful when she had to start walking again.  Each morning she gritted
her teeth and struggled on.

19o "Going through the Five Mountain Passes'

Much of the way there were no roads.  The going was appalling,
especially when it rained: the earth became a mass of slippery mud, and
my mother fell down more times than she could count.  At the end of the
day she would be covered with mud.  When they reached their destination
for the night, she would collapse on the ground and just lie there,
unable to move.

One day they had to walk over thirty miles in heavy rain.

The temperature was well over 9o F, and my mother was soaked to the
skin with rain and sweat.  They had to climb a mountain not a
particularly high one, only about 3,000 feet, but my mother was
completely exhausted.  She felt her bedroll weighing on her like a huge
stone.  Her eyes were clogged with sweat pouring from her forehead.
When she opened her mouth to gasp for air, she felt she could not get
enough into her lungs to breathe.  Thousands of stars were dancing
before her eyes and she could hardly drag one foot in front of the
other.  When she got to the top she thought her misery was over, but
going downhill was almost as difficult.  Her calf muscles seemed to
have turned to jelly.  It was wild country, and the steep, narrow path
ran along the edge of a cliff, with a drop of hundreds of feet.  Her
legs were trembling and she felt sure she was going to fall into the
abyss.  Several times she had to cling to trees to keep from toppling
over the cliff.

After they had crossed the mountain there were several deep,
fast-flowing rivers in their path.  The water level rose to her waist
and she found it almost impossible to keep her footing.  In the middle
of one river she stumbled and felt she was about to be swept away when
a man leaned over and caught hold of her.  She almost broke down and
wept, particularly since at this very moment she spotted a friend of
hers whose husband was carrying her across the river.

Although the husband was a senior official, and had the right to use a
car, he had waived his privilege in order to walk with his wife.

My father was not carrying my mother.  He was being

My Mother's Long March 19i driven along in a jeep, with his bodyguard.
His rank entitled him to transportation either a jeep or a horse,
whichever was available.  My mother had often hoped that he would give
her a lift, or at least carry her bedroll in his jeep, but he never
offered.  The evening after she almost drowned in the river, she
decided to have it out with him.

She had had a terrible day.  What was more, she was vomiting all the
time.  Could he not let her travel in his jeep occasionally?  He said
he could not, because it would be taken as favoritism since my mother
was not entitled to the car.  He felt he had to fight against the
age-old Chinese tradition of nepotism.  Furthermore, my mother was
supposed to experience hardship.  When she mentioned that her friend
was being carried by her husband, my father replied that that was
completely different: the friend was a veteran Communist.  In the 193OS
she had commanded a goerrilla unit jointly with Kim II Sung, who later
became president of North Korea, fighting the Japanese under appalling
conditions in the northeast.  Among the long list of sufferings in her
revolutionary career was the loss of her first husband, who had been
executed on orders from Stalin.  My mother could not compare herself to
this woman, my father said.  She was only a young student.  If other
people thought she was being pampered she would be in trouble.

"It's for your own good," he added, reminding her that her application
for full Party membership was pending.

"You have a choice: you can either get into the car or get into the
Party, but not both."

He had a point.  The revolution was fundamentally a peasant revolution,
and the peasants had an unrelentingly harsh life.  They were
particularly sensitive about other people enjoying or seeking comfort.
Anyone who took part in the revolution was supposed to toughen
themselves to the point where they became inured to hardship.  My
father had done this at Yan'an and as a goerrilla.

My mother understood the theory, but that did not stop her thinking
about the fact that my father was giving her

192 "Going through the Five Mountain Passes' no sympathy while she was
sick and exhausted the whole time, trudging along, carrying her
bedroll, sweating, vomiting, her legs like lead.

One night she could not stand it anymore, and burst into tears for the
first time.  The group usually stayed overnight in places like empty
storerooms, or classrooms.  That night they were all sleeping in a
temple, packed close together on the ground.  My father was lying next
to her.

When she first started crying, she turned her face away from him and
buried it in her sleeve, trying to muffle her sobs.  My father woke up
at once and hurriedly clapped his hand over her mouth.  Through her
tears she heard him whispering into her ear: "Don't cry out loud!  If
people hear you, you will be critcized."  To be criticized was serious.
It meant her comrades would say she was not worthy of 'being in the
revolution," even a coward.  She felt him urgently pushing a
handkerchief into her hand so that she could stifle her sobs.

The next day my mother's unit head, the man who had saved her from
falling over in the river, took her aside and told her he had received
complaints about her crying.

People were saying she had behaved like 'a precious lady from the
exploiting classes."  He was not unsympathetic, but he had to reflect
what other people were saying.  It was disgraceful to cry after walking
a few steps, he said.  She was not behaving like a proper
revolutionary.  From then on, though she often felt like it, my mother
never cried once.

She slogged on.  The most dangerous area they had to go through was the
province of Shandong, which had fallen to the Communists only a couple
of months previously.  On one occasion they were walking through a deep
valley when bullets started pouring down on them from above.  My mother
took cover behind a rock.  The shooting went on for about ten minutes,
and when it died down they found that one of their group had been
killed trying to get around behind the assailants, who turned out to be
bandits.  Several others were injured.  They buffed the dead man by the
roadside.  My father and the other officials gave up their horses to
the injured.

After forty days of marching and more skirmishes they reached the city
of Nanjing, about 7o0 miles due south of Jinzhou, which had been the
capital of the Kuomintang government.  It is known as 'the Furnace of
China," and in mid-September it was still like an oven.  The group was
housed in a barracks.  The bamboo mattress on my mother's bed had a
dark human figure imprinted on it by the sweat of those who had slept
there before her.  The group had to do military training in the
sweltering heat, learning how to tie up a bedroll, puttees, and
knapsack on the double, and practicing quick marching carrying their
kits.  As part of the army, they had to observe strict discipline. They
wore khaki uniforms and rough cotton shirts and underwear.  Their
uniforms had to be buttoned right up to the neck and they were never
allowed to unbutton the collar.  My mother found it hard to breathe,
and like everyone she had a huge dark patch of sweat covering her back.
They also wore a double-thickness cotton cap, which had to fit tightly
around the head so that it did not show any hair.  This made my mother
perspire profusely, and the edge of her cap was permanently soaked in
sweat.

Occasionally they were allowed out, and the first thing she did was to
devour several ice lollipops.  Many of the people in the group had
never been in a big city, apart from their brief stop at Tianjin.  They
were tremendously excited by the ice lollipops, and bought some to take
back to their comrades in the barracks, wrapping them up carefully in
their white hand towels and putting them in their bags.  They were
amazed when they got back to find that all that was left was water.

At Nanjing they had to attend political lectures, some of which were
given by Deng Xiaoping, the future leader of China, and General Chen
Yi, the future foreign minister.

My mother and her colleagues sat on the lawn at the

Central University, in the shade, while the lecturers stood in the
blazing sun for two or three hours at a stretch.  In spite of the heat,
the lecturers mesmerized their audience.

One day my mother and her unit had to run several miles on the double,
fully laden, to the tomb of the founding father of the republic, Sun
Yat-sen.  When they returned, my mother felt an ache in her lower
abdomen.

There was a performance of the Peking Opera that night in another part
of the city, with one of China's most famous stars in the lead.  My
mother had inherited her mother's passion for the Peking Opera and was
looking forward eagerly to the performance.

That evening she walked with her comrades in file to the opera, which
was about five miles away.  My father went in his car.  On the way, my
mother felt more pain in her abdomen, and contemplated turning back,
but decided against it.  Halfway through the performance the pain
became unbearable.  She went over to where my father was sitting and
asked him to take her home in his car.  She did not tell him about the
pain.  He looked round to where his driver was sitting and saw him
glued to his seat, openmouthed.  He turned back to my mother and said:
"How can I interrupt his enjoyment just because my wife wants to
leave?"  My mother lost any desire to e~la'm that she was in agony and
turned abruptly away.

She walked all the way back to the barracks in excruciating pain.
Everything in front of her eyes was spinning.  She saw blackness with
sharp stars and felt as though she were plodding through cotton wool.
She could not see the road and lost track of how long she had been
walking.  It seemed like a lifetime.  When she got back, the barracks
was deserted.  Everybody except the guards had gone to the opera.  She
managed to drag herself to her bed, and by the light of a lamp she saw
that her trousers were soaked with blood.  She fainted as soon as her
head hit the bed.  She had lost her first child.  And there was nobody
near her.

A little later my father returned.  Being in a car, he got back before
most of the others.  He found my mother sprawled on the bed.  At first
he thought she was just exhausted, but then he saw the blood and
realized that she was unconscious.  He rushed off to find a doctor, who
thought she must have had a miscarriage.  Being an army doctor he had
no experience of what to do, so he telephoned a hospital in the city
and asked them to send an ambulance.  The hospital agreed but only on
condition that they were paid in silver dollars for the ambulance and
the emergency operation.  Even though he had no money of his own, my
father agreed without hesitation.  Being 'with the revolution' brought
automatic health insurance.

My mother had very nearly died.  She had to have a blood transfusion
and her womb scraped.  When she opened her eyes after the operation she
saw my father sit ling by her bedside.  The first thing she said was:
"I want a divorce."

My father apologized profusely.  He had had no idea she had been
pregnant nor, in fact had she.  She knew that she had missed her
period, but had thought it was probably the result of the unrelenting
exertion of the march.  My father said he had not known what a
miscarriage was.  He promised to be much more considerate in future,
and said over and over again he loved her and would reform.

While my mother was in a coma, he had washed her blood-soaked clothes,
which was very unusual for a Chinese man.  Eventually my mother agreed
not to ask for a divorce, but she said she wanted to go back to
Manchuria to resume her medical studies.  She told my father she could
never please the revolution, no matter how hard she tried; all she ever
got was criticism.

"I might as well leave," she said.

"You mustn't!"  my father said, anxiously.

"That will be interpreted as meaning you are afraid of hardship.

You will be regarded as a deserter and you will have no future.  Even
if the college accepted you, you would never be able to get a good job.
You would be discriminated against for the rest of your life."  My
mother was not yet aware that there was an unbreakable ban on opting
out of

196 "Going through the Fbve Mountain Passes' the system, because,
typically, it was unwritten.  But she caught the tone of extreme
urgency in his voice.  Once you were 'with the revolution' you could
never leave.

My mother was in the hospital when, on i October, she and her comrades
were alerted to expect a special broadcast, which would come over
loudspeakers that had been rigged up around the hospital.  They
gathered to listen to Mao proclaiming the founding of the People's
Republic from the top of the Gate of Heavenly Peace in Peking.  My
mother cried like a child.  The China she had dreamed of, fought for,
and hoped for was here at last, she thought, the country to which she
could devote herself heart and soul.  As she listened to Mao's voice
announcing that 'the Chinese people have stood up," she chided herself
for ever having wavered.  Her suffering was trivial compared to the
great cause of saving China.  She felt intensely proud and full of
nationalistic feeling, and pledged to herself that she would stick with
the revolution forever.  When Mao's short proclamation was over, she
and her comrades burst into cheers and threw their caps in the air a
gesture the Chinese Communists had learned from the Russians.

Then, after drying their tears, they had a little feast to celebrate.

A few days before the miscarriage, my parents had their first formal
photograph taken together.  It shows them both in army uniform, staring
pensively and rather wistfully into the camera.  The photograph was
taken to commemorate their entry into the former Kuomintang capital. My
mother immediately sent a print to her mother.

On 3 October my father's unit was moved out.  Communist forces were
nearing Sichuan.  My mother had to stay in the hospital another month,
and was then allowed some time to recuperate in a magnificent mansion
which had belonged to the main financier of the Kuomintang, Chiang
Kai-shek's brother-in-law H. H. Kung.  One day her unit was told they
were going to be extras in a documentary film about the liberation of
Nanjing.  They were given civilian clothes and dressed up as ordinary
citizens welcoming the Communists.  This reconstruction, which was not
inaccurate, was shown all over China as a 'documentary' - a common
practice.

My mother stayed on in Nanjing for nearly two more months.  Every now
and then she would get a telegram or a bunch of letters from my father.
He wrote every day and sent the letters whenever he could find a post
office that was working.  In every one, he told her how much he loved
her, promised to reform, and insisted that she must not go back to
Jinzhou and 'desert the revolution."

Toward the end of December, my mother was told there was a place for
her on a steamer with some other people who had been left behind
because of illness.  They were to assemble on the dock at nightfall
Kuomintang bombing made it too dangerous during daylight.  The quay was
shrouded in a chilly fog.  The few lights had been turned out as a
precaution against air raids.  A bitter north wind was sweeping snow
across the river.  My mother had to wait for hours on the dock,
desperately stamping her numb feet, which were clad only in the
standard-issue thin cotton shoes known as 'liberation shoes," some of
which had slogans such as "Beat Chiang Kai-shek' and "Safeguard Our
Land' painted on their soles.

The steamer carried them west along the Yangtze.  For about the first
200 miles, as far as the town of Anqing, it moved only at night, tying
up during the day among reeds on the north bank of the river to hide
from Kuomintang planes.  The ship carried a contingent of soldiers, who
set up machine guns on the deck, and a large amount of military
equipment and ammunition.  There were occasional skirmishes with
Kuomintang forces and landowners' gangs.  Once, as they were edging
into the reeds to anchor for the day, they came under heavy fire and
some Kuomintang troops tried to board the ship.  My mother and the
other women hid belowdecks while the guards fought them off.  The ship
had to sail off and anchor farther on.

When they reached the Yangtze Gorges, where Sichuan begins and the
river becomes dramatically narrower, they had to change into two
smaller boats which had come from Chongqing.  The military cargo and
some guards were transferred to one boat, while the rest of the group
took the second boat.

The Yangtze Gorges were known as 'the Gates of Hell."

One afternoon the bright winter sun suddenly disappeared.

My mother rushed on deck to see what had happened.  On both sides huge
perpendicular cliffs towered over the river, leaning toward the boat as
though they were about to crush it.  The cliffs were covered with thick
vegetation and were so high that they almost obscured the sky.  Every
cliff seemed steeper than the last, and they looked as though some
mighty sword had smashed down from heaven and cleaved its way through
them.

The small boat battled for days against the currents, whirlpools,
rapids, and submerged rocks, Sometimes the force of the current swept
it backwards, and it felt as though it was going to capsize at any
moment.  Often my mother thought they were going to be dashed into a
cliff, but each time the helmsman managed to steer away at the last
second.

The Communists had taken most of Sichuan only within the last month. It
was still infested with Kuomintang troops, who had been stranded there
when Chiang Kaishek had abandoned his resistance on the mainland and
fled to Taiwan.  The worst moment came when a band of these Kuomintang
soldiers shelled the first boat, which was carrying the ammunition. 
One round hit it square on.

My mother was standing on deck when it blew up about a hundred yards
ahead of her.  It seemed as though the whole fiver suddenly burst into
fire.  Flaming chunks of timber rushed toward my mother's boat, and it
looked as if there was no way they could avoid colliding with the
burning wreckage.  But just as a collision seemed inevitable, it
floated past, missing them by inches.  Nobody showed any signs of fear,
or elation.  They all seemed to have grown numb to death.  Most of the
guards on the first boat were killed.

My mother was entering a whole new world of climate and nature.  The
precipices along the gorges were covered with gigantic rattan creepers
which made the eerie atmosphere even more exotic.  Monkeys were jumping
from branch to branch in the luxuriant foliage.  The endless,
magnificent, precipitous mountains were a stunning novelty after the
flat plains around Jinzhou.

Sometimes the boat would moor at the foot of a narrow flight of black
stone stairs, which seemed to climb endlessly up the side of a mountain
with its peak hidden in the clouds.  Often there was a small town at
the top of the mountain.  Because of the permanent thick mist, the
inhabitants had to burn rapeseed-oil lamps even in the daytime.

It was chilly, with damp winds blowing off the mountains and the fiver.
To my mother, the local peasants seemed horribly dark, bony, and tiny,
with much sharper features and much bigger and rounder eyes than the
people she was used to.  They wore a kind of turban made of long white
cloth wound around their foreheads.  White being the color of mourning
in China, my mother at first thought they were wearing mourning.

By the middle of January they had reached Chongqing, which had been the
Kuomintang's capital during the war against Japan, where my mother had
to move to a smaller boat for the next stage to the town of Luzhou,
about a hundred miles farther upriver.  There she received a message
from my father that a sampan had been sent to meet her and that she
could come to Yibin right away.  This was the first she knew that he
had arrived at his destination alive.  By now her resentment against
him had evaporated.

It was four months since she had seen him, and she missed him.  She had
imagined the excitement he must have felt along the way at seeing so
many sites described by the ancient poets, and she felt a glow of
warmth in the sure zoo "Going through the Five Mountain Passes'
knowledge that he would have composed poems for her on the journey.

She was able to leave that same evening.  Next morning when she woke,
she could feel the warmth of the sun coming through the soft mist.  The
hills along the river were green and gentle, and she was able to lie
back and relax and listen to the water lapping against the prow of the
sampan.  She got to Yibin that afternoon, the eve of Chinese New Year.
Her first sight of file town was like an apparition a delicate image of
a city floating in the clouds.

As the boat approached the quay, she looked about for my father.
Eventually, through the mist, she could make out his hazy image: he was
standing in an unbuttoned army greatcoat, his bodyguard behind him. The
riverbank was wide and covered with sand and cobblestones.  She could
see the city climbing up to the top of the hill.  Some of the houses
were built on long, thin, wooden stilts and seemed to be swaying in the
wind as though they might collapse at any minute.

The boat tied up at a dock on the promontory at the tip of the city.  A
boatman laid down a plank of wood and my father's bodyguard came across
and took my mother's bedroll.  She bounced down the gangway, and my
father stretched out his arms to help her off.  It was not the proper
thing to embrace in public, though my mother could tell he was as
excited as she, and she felt very happy.

8. "Returnins Home Robed in Embroidered Silk' To Family and Bandits
(1949-1951)

All the way, my mother had been wondering what Yibin would be like.
Would there be electricity?  Would the mountains be as high as those
along the Yangtze?  Would there be theaters?  As she climbed up the
hill with my father, she was thrilled to see she had come to a
beautiful place.  Yibin stands on a hill overlooking a promontory at
the confluence of two rivers, one clear, the other muddy.

She could see electric lights shining in the rows of cottages.

Their walls were made of mud and bamboo, and to her eyes the thin,
curved files on the roofs seemed delicate, almost lace like compared to
the heavy ones needed to cope with the winds and snow of Manchuria.  In
the distance, through the mist, she could see little houses of bamboo
and earth set in the midst of dark-green mountains covered in camphor
trees, meta sequoia and tea bushes.  She felt unburdened at last, not
least because my father was letting his bodyguard carry her bedroll.
Having passed through scores of war-torn towns and villages, she was
delighted to see that here there was no war damage at all.  The

7,000-man Kuomintang garrison had surrendered without a fight.

My father was living in an elegant mansion which had been taken over by
the new government as combined offices and living quarters, and my
mother moved in with him.  It had a garden full of plants she had never
seen:

phoebe nanmu, papayas, and bananas, on grounds covered with green moss.
Goldfish swam in a tank, and there was even a turtle.  My father's
bedroom had a double sofa bed, the softest thing she had ever slept on,
having previously known only brick kangs.  Even in winter, all one
needed in Yibin was a quilt.  There was no biting wind or all-pervasive
dust like in Manchuria.  You did not have to wear a gauze scarf over
your face to be able to breathe.  The well was not covered with a lid;
there was a bamboo pole sticking out, with a bucket tied to the other
end for drawing water.

People washed their clothes on slabs of smooth shiny stones propped up
at a slight angle, and used palm-fiber brushes to clean them.  These
operations would have been impossible in Manchuria, where the clothes
would immediately have been either covered in dust or frozen solid. For
the first time in her life, my mother could eat rice and fresh
vegetables every day.

The following weeks were my parents' real honeymoon.

For the first time my mother could live with my father without being
criticized for 'putting love first."  The general atmosphere was
relaxed; the Communists were elated at their sweeping victories and my
father's colleagues did not insist on married couples staying together
only on Saturday nights.

Yibin had fallen less than two months earlier, on I i December 1949. My
father had arrived six days later, and had been appointed head of the
county of Yibin, which had a population of over a million people, about
100,000 of whom lived in the city of Yibin.  He had arrived by boat
with a group of more than a hundred students who had 'joined the
revolution' in Nanjing.  When the boat came up the Yangtze, it stopped
first at the Yibin power station on the riverbank opposite the city,
which had been a stronghold of the underground.  Several hundred
workers came out to greet my father's party on the quay, waving lit He
red paper flags with five stars the new flag of Communist China and
shouting welcoming slogans.  The flags had the stars in the wrong place
the local Communists did not know the right place to put them.  My
father went ashore with another officer to address the workers, who
were delighted when they heard him speaking in Yibin dialect.  Instead
of the ordinary army cap which everyone else was wearing he wore an old
eight-cornered cap of the type which the Communist army used to wear in
the 192os and early 193os, which struck the locals as unusual and
rather stylish.

Then the boat took them across the river to the city.  My father had
been away ten years.  He had been very fond of his family, especially
his youngest sister, to whom he had written enthusiastically from
Yan'an about his new life and how he wanted her to join him there
someday.  The letters had stopped coming as the Kuomintang tightened
its blockade, and the first the family had heard from my father for
many years was when they received the photo of him and my mother taken
in Nanjing.  For the previous seven years they had not even known if he
was alive.  They had missed him, cried at the thought of him, and
prayed to the Buddha for his safe return.  With the photograph he had
sent a note saying he would soon be in Yibin, and that he had changed
his name.  While in Yan'an, like many others, he had taken a nora de
guerre, Wang Yu.  Yu meant "Selfless to the point of being considered
foolish."  As soon as he arrived my father reverted to his real
surname, Chang, but he incorporated his nora de guerre and called
himself Chang Shou-yu, meaning "Keep Yu."

Ten years before, my father had left as a poor, hungry, and put-upon
apprentice; now he had returned, not yet thirty, as a powerful man.
This was a traditional Chinese dream, which has entered the language as
yi-jin-huanxiang, 'returning home robed in embroidered silk."  His
family was tremendously proud of him, and they were longing to see what
he was like after ten years, as they had heard all sorts of strange
things about the Communists.

And of course his mother, especially, wanted to know about his new
wife..

My father talked and laughed loudly and heartily.  He was the picture
of unrestrained, almost boyish excitement.

He has not changed after all, his mother thought with a sigh of relief
and happiness.  Through their traditional, deep-rooted reserve, the
family showed their joy in their eager, tear-filled eyes.  Only his
youngest sister was more animated.  She talked vividly while playing
with her long plaits, which every now and then she threw back over her
shoulder when she tilted her head to emphasize what she was saying.  My
father smiled as he recognized the traditional Sichuan gesture of
feminine playfulness.  He had almost forgotten it in his ten years of
austerity in the North.

There was a lot of catching up to do.  My father's mother was well into
her account of what had happened to the family since he had left when
she said there was one thing worrying her: what was going to happen to
her eldest daughter, who had looked after her in Chongqing.  This
daughter's husband had died and left her some land, which she had hired
a few laborers to work.  There were a lot of rumors flying around about
the Communists' land reform, and the family was worried that she would
be classified as a landlord and have her land taken away.  The women
became emotional, their worries shading into recriminations: "What is
going to happen to her?  How is she going to live?  How can the
Communists do a thing like this?"

My father was hurt and exasperated.  He burst out: "I have looked
forward so much to this day, to share our victory with you.  All
injustice is going to be a thing of the past.  It is a time to be
positive, to rejoice.  But you are so distrustful, so critical.  You
only want to find fault..."

Whereupon he burst into tears like a lit He boy.  The women all cried
too.  For him, they were tears of disappointment and frustration.  For
them, the feelings must have been more complex; among them were doubt
and uncertainty.

My father's mother was living in the old family home just outside the
city, which had been left to her by her husband when he died.  It was a
modestly luxurious country house low-lying, made of wood and brick, and
walled off from the road.  It had a big garden at the front, and at the
back was a field of winter plums, which gave off a delicious perfume,
and thick bamboo groves, which lent it the atmosphere of an enchanted
garden.  It was spotlessly clean.  All the windows were gleaming, and
there was not a speck of dust anywhere.  The furniture was made of
beautiful shiny padauk wood, which is a deep red, sometimes almost
shading into black.  My mother fell in love with the house from her
first visit, on the day after she arrived in Yibin.

This was an important occasion.  In Chinese tradition the person with
the most power over a married woman was always her mother-in-law, to
whom she had to be completely obedient and who would tyrannize her.
When she in turn became a mother-in-law, she would bully her own
daughter-in-law in the same way.  Liberating daughters-in-law was an
important Communist policy, and rumors abounded that Communist
daughters-in-law were arrogant dragons, ready to boss their
mothers-in-law around.  Everyone was on tenterhooks waiting to see how
my mother would behave.

My father had a very large extended family, and they all gathered in
the house that day.  As my mother approached the front gate, she heard
people whispering, "She's coming, she's coming!"  Adults were shushing
their children, who were jumping around trying to catch a glimpse of
the strange Communist daughter-in-law from the far north.

When my mother entered the sitting room with my father, her
mother-in-law was seated at the far end on a formal, carved square
padauk chair.  Leading up to her on both sides of the room, enhancing
the formality, were two symmetrical rows of square, exquisitely carved
padauk chairs.  A small table with a vase or some other ornament on it
stood between every two chairs.  Walking up the middle, my mother saw
that her mother-in-law had a very calm face, with high cheekbones
(which my father had inherited), small eyes, a sharp chin, and thin
lips which drooped slightly at the corners.  She was tiny, and her eyes
seemed to be half closed, almost as though she were medltaling.  My
mother walked slowly up to her with my father, and stopped in front of
her chair.  Then she knelt and kowtowed three times.  This was the
correct thing to do according to the traditional ritual, but everyone
had been wondering if the young Communist would go through with it. The
room burst into relieved sighs.  My father's cousins and sisters
whispered to his obviously delighted mother:

"What a lovely daughter-in-law!  So gentle, so pretty, and so
respectful!  Mother, you are really in good fortune?

My mother was quite proud of her little conquest.  She and my father
had spent some time discussing what to do.

The Communists had said they were going to get rid of kowtowing, which
they considered an insult to human dignity, but my mother wanted to
make an exception, just this once.  My father agreed.  He did not want
to hurt his mother, or offend his wife not after the miscarriage; and
besides, this kowtow was different.  It was to make a point for the
Communists.  But he would not kowtow himself, although it was expected
of him.

All the women in my father's family were Buddhists, and one of his
sisters, Jun-ying, who was unmarried, was particularly devout.  She
took my mother to kowtow to a statue of the Buddha, to the shrines of
the family ancestors which were set up on Chinese New Year, and even to
the groves of winter plum.~ and bamboo in the back garden.

Aunt Jun-ying believed that every flower and every tree had a spirit.
She would ask my mother to do a dozen kowtows to the bamboos to beg
them not to flower, which the Chinese believed portended disaster.  My
mother found all this great fun.  It reminded her of her childhood and
gave her a chance to indulge her sense of playfulness.  My father did
not approve, but she mollified him by saying it was just a performance
to help the Communists' image.

The Kuomintang had said the Communists would wipe out all traditional
customs, and she said it was important for people to see that this was
not happening.

My father's family was very kind to my mother.  In spite of her initial
formality, my grandmother was in fact extremely easygoing.  She seldom
passed judgment, and was never critical.  Aunt Jun-ying's round face
was marked by smallpox, but her eyes were so gentle that anyone could
see that she was a kind woman, with whom they could feel safe and
relaxed.  My mother could not help comparing her new in-laws with her
own mother.  They did not exude her energy and sprightliness, but their
ease and serenity made my mother feel completely at home.  Aunt
Jun-ying cooked delicious spicy Sichuan food, which is quite different
from the bland northern food.  The dishes had exotic names which my
mother loved: 'tiger fights the dragon," 'imperial concubine chicken,"
'hot saucy duck," 'suckling golden cock crows to the dawn."  My mother
went to the house often, and would eat with the family, looking out
into the orchard of plums, almonds, and peaches which made a sea of
pink and white blossoms in early spring.  She found a warm, welcoming
atmosphere among the women in the Chang family, and felt very much
loved by them.

My mother was soon assigned a job in the Public Affairs Department of
the government of Yibin County.  She spent very little time in the
office.  The first priority was to feed the population and this was
beginning to be difficult.

The southwest was the last holdout of the Kuomintang leadership, and a
quarter of a million soldiers had been stranded in Sichuan when Chiang
Kai-shek fled the province for Taiwan in December 1949.  Sichuan was,

zo8 "Returning Home Robed in Embroidered Silk' moreover, one of the few
places where the Communists had not occupied the countryside before
they took the cities.  Kuomintang units, disorganized but often well
armed, still controlled much of the countryside in southern Sichuan,
and most of the food supply was in the hands of landlords who were
pro-Kuomintang.  The Communists urgently needed to secure supplies to
feed the cities, as well as their own forces and the large numbers of
Kuomintang troops who had surrendered.

At first they sent people out to try to buy food.  Many of the big
landlords had traditionally had their own private armies, which now
joined up with the bands of Kuomintang soldiers.  A few days after my
mother reached Yibin, these forces launched a full-scale uprising in
south Sichuan.  Yibin was in danger of starvation.

The Communists started sending out armed teams made up of officials
escorted by army guards to collect food.  Almost everyone was
mobilized.  Government offices were empty.  In the whole of the Yibin
county government only two women were left behind: one was a
receptionist and the other had a newborn baby.

My mother went on a number of these expeditions, which lasted many days
at a time.  There were thirteen people in her team: seven civilians and
six soldiers.  My mother's gear consisted of a bedroll, a bag of rice,
and a heavy umbrella made of tung-oil-painted canvas, all of which she
had to carry on her back.  The team had to trek for days through wild
country and over what the Chinese call 'sheep's-intestine trails'
treacherous narrow mountain paths winding around steep precipices and
gullies.

When they came to a village they would go to the shabbiest hovel and
try to form a rapport with the very poor peasants, telling them that
the Communists would give people like them their own land and a happy
life, and then asking them which landowners had rice hoarded.  Most of
the peasants had inherited a traditional fear and suspicion of any
officials.  Many had only vaguely heard of the Communists,

To Family and Bandits 2oq and everything they had heard was bad; but my
mother, having quickly modified her northern dialect with a local
accent, was highly articulate and persuasive.  Explaining the new
policy turned out to be her forte.  If the team succeeded in getting
information about the landlords, they would go and try to persuade them
to sell at designated collection points, where they would be paid on
delivery.

Some were scared and disgorged without much fuss.

Others informed on the team's whereabouts to one of the armed gangs. My
mother and her comrades were often fired at, and spent every night on
the alert, sometimes having to move from place to place to avoid
attack.

At first they would stay with poor peasants.  But if the bandits found
out someone had helped them, they would kill the entire household.
After a number of killings, the team decided they could not jeopardize
innocent people's lives.  So they slept in the open, or in abandoned
temples.

On her third expedition, my mother started vomiting and suffering from
dizzy spells.  She was pregnant again.

She got back to Yibin exhausted and desperate for a rest, but her team
had to set off on another expedition at once.

It had been left vague what a pregnant woman should do, and she was
torn about whether to go or not.  She wanted to go, and the mood at the
time was very much one of self sacrifice it was considered shameful to
complain about anything.  But she was frightened by the memory of her
miscarriage only five months before, and by the thought of having
another one in the midst of the wilderness, where there were no doctors
or transportation.  Moreover, the expeditions involved almost daily bat
ties with the bandits, and it was important to be able to run and run
fast.  Even walking made her dizzy.

Still, she decided to go.  There was one other woman going, who was
also pregnant.  One afternoon the team was settling down for lunch in a
deserted courtyard.  They assumed the owner had fled, probably from
them.  The shoulder-high mud walls which ran around the weed-covered
yard had collapsed
in several places.  The wooden gate was unlocked and was creaking in
the spring breeze.

The team's rice was being prepared in the abandoned kitchen by their
cook, when a middle-aged man appeared.

He had the appearance of a peasant: he was wearing straw sandals and
loose trousers, with a big apronlike piece of cloth tucked up on one
side into a cotton cummerbund, and he had a dirty white turban on his
head.  He told them that a gang of men belonging to a notorious group
of bandits known as the Broadsword Brigade was headed their way and
that they were especially keen to capture my mother and the other woman
in the team, because they knew they were the wives of high Communist
officials.

This man was not an ordinary peasant.  Under the Kuomintang, he had
been the chieftain of the local township, which governed a number of
villages, including the one the team was in.  The Broadsword Brigade
had tried to win his cooperation, as they did with all former
Kuomintang men and landlords.  He had joined the brigade, but he wanted
to keep his options open, and he was tipping off the Communists to buy
insurance.  He told them the best way to escape.

The team immediately jumped up and ran.  But my mother and the other
pregnant woman could not move very fast, so the chieftain led them out
through a gap in the wall and helped them hide in a haystack nearby.
The cook lingered in the kitchen to wrap up the cooked rice and pour
cold water onto the wok to cool it down so that he could take it with
him.  The rice and the wok were too precious to be abandoned; an iron
wok was hard to obtain, especially in wartime.  Two of the soldiers
stayed in the kitchen helping him and trying to hurry him up.  At last
the cook grabbed the rice and the wok and the three of them raced for
the back door.  But the bandits were already coming through the front
door, and caught up with them after a few yards.  They fell on them and
knifed them to death.  The gang was short of guns and did not have
enough

To Family and Bandits 21 I ammunition to shoot at the rest of the team,
whom they could see not far away.  They did not discover my mother and
the other woman in the haystack.

Not long afterward the gang was captured, along with the chieftain.  He
was both a leader of the gang and one of the 'snakes in their old
haunts," which made him eligible for execution.  But he had tipped off
the team and saved the lives of the two women.  At the time, death
sentences had to be endorsed by a three-man review board.  It happened
that the head of the tribunal was my father.  The second member was the
husband of the other pregnant woman, and the third was the local police
chief.

The tribunal split two to one.  The husband of the other woman voted to
spare the chieftain's life.  My father and the police chief voted to
uphold the death sentence.  My mother pleaded with the tribunal to let
the man live, but my father was adamant.  This was exactly what the man
had been banking on, he told my mother: he had chosen this particular
team to tip off precisely because he knew it contained the wives of two
important officials.

"He has a lot of blood on his hands," my father said.  The husband of
the other woman disagreed vehemently.

"But," my father retorted, banging his fist on the table, 'we cannot be
lenient, precisely because our wives are involved.  If we let personal
feelings influence our judgment, what would be the difference between
the new China and the old?"  The chieftain was executed.

My mother could not forgive my father for this.  She felt that the man
should not die, because he had saved so many lives, and my father, in
particular, 'owed' him a life.  The way she looked at it, which was how
most Chinese would have seen it, my father's behavior meant he did not
treasure her, unlike the husband of the other woman.

No sooner was the trial over than my mother's team was sent off to the
countryside again.  She was still feeling very sick from her pregnancy,
vomiting a lot and exhausted all the time.  She had had pains in her
abdomen ever since the violent rush to the haystack.  The husband of
the other pregnant woman decided he was not going to let his wife go
again.

"I will protect my pregnant wife," he said.

"And I will protect any wives who are pregnant.  No pregnant woman
should have to undergo such dangers."  But he met fierce opposition
from my mother's boss, Mrs.  Mi, a peasant woman who had been a
guerrilla.  It was unthinkable for a peasant woman to take a rest if
she was pregnant.

She worked right up to the moment of delivery, and there were
innumerable stories about women cutting the umbilical cord with a
sickle and carrying on.  Mrs.  Mi had borne her own baby on a
battlefield and had had to abandon it on the spot a baby's cry could
have endangered the whole unit.  After losing her child, she seemed to
want others to suffer a similar fate.  She insisted on sending my
mother off again, producing a very effective argument.  At the time, no
Party members were allowed to marry except relatively senior officials
(those who qualified as '28-7-regiment-I ').

Any woman who was pregnant, therefore, was virtually bound to be a
member of the elite.  And if they did not go, how could the Party hope
to persuade other people to go?

My father agreed with her, and told my mother she ought togo.

My mother accepted this, in spite of her fears of another miscarriage.
She was prepared to die, but she had hoped that my father would be
against her going and would say so; that way she would have felt he put
her safety first.

But she could see that my father's first loyalty was to the revolution,
and she was bitterly disappointed.

She spent several painful and exhausting weeks traipsing around the
hills and mountains.  The skirmishes were intensifying.  Almost every
day came news of members of other teams being tortured and murdered by
bandits.  They were particularly sadistic to women.  One day the corpse
of one of my father's nieces was dumped just outside the city gate: she
had been raped and knifed, and her vagina was a bloody mess.  Another
young woman was caught by the

Broadsword Brigade during a skirmish.  They were surrounded by armed
Communists, so they tied the woman up and told her to shout out to her
comrades to let them escape.  Instead she shouted, "Go ahead, don't
worry about me!"  Every time she called out one of the bandits cut a
hunk out of her flesh with a knife.  She died horribly mutilated. After
several such incidents, it was decided that women would not be sent on
food-collecting expeditions anymore.

Meanwhile, in Jinzhou my grandmother had been worrying constantly about
her daughter.  As soon as she got a letter from her saying she had
arrived in Yibin, she decided to go and make sure she was all right. In
March 195o she set off on her own long march across China, alone.

She knew nothing about the rest of the huge country, and imagined that
Sichuan was not only mountainous and cut off, but also lacking in the
daily necessities of life.  Her first instinct was to take a large
supply of basic goods with her.  But the country was still in a state
of upheaval, and fighting was still going on along her intended route;
she realized she was going to have to carry her own luggage, and
probably walk a good deal of the way, which was extremely difficult on
bound feet.  In the end she set fled on one small bundle, which she
could carry herself.

Her feet had grown bigger since she had married Dr.  Xia.  By
tradition, the Manchus did not practice foot binding so my grandmother
had taken off the binding cloths and her feet gradually grew a little. 
This process was almost as painful as the original binding.  The broken
bones could not mend, of course, so the feet did not go back to their
original shape, but remained crippled and shrunken.  My grandmother
wanted her feet to look normal, so she used to stuff cotton wool into
her shoes.

Before she left, Lin Xiao-xia, the man who had brought her to my
parents' wedding, gave her a document which said she was the mother of
a revolutionary; with this, Party

214 "Returning Horne Robed in Embroidered Silk' organizations along the
way would provide her with food, accommodations, and money.  She
followed almost the same route as my parents, taking the train part of
the way, sometimes traveling in trucks, and walking when there was no
other transportation.  Once she was on an open truck with some women
and children who all belonged to families of Communists.  The truck
stopped for some of the children to have a pee.  The moment it did so
bullets ripped into the wooden planks around the side.  My grandmother
hunkered down in the back while bullets zinged by inches above her
head.  The guards fired back with machine guns and managed to silence
the attackers, who turned out to be Kuomintang stragglers.  My
grandmother emerged unscathed, but several of the children and some of
the guards were killed.

When she got to Wuhan, a big city in central China, which was about
two-thirds of the way, she was told that the next stretch, by boat up
the Yangtze, was unsafe because of bandits.  She had to wait a month
until things quieted down even so, her ship was attacked several times
from the shore.  The boat, which was rather ancient, had a flat, open
deck, so the guards built a wall of sandbags about four feet high down
both sides of it, with slits for their guns.  It looked like a floating
fortress.  Whenever it was fired on, the captain would put it on full
steam ahead and try to race through the fusillade, while the guards
shot back from behind their sandbagged embrasures.  My grandmother
would go belowdecks and wait until the shooting was over.

She changed to a smaller boat at Yichang and passed through the Yangtze
Gorges, and by May she was near Yibin, sitting in a boat covered with
palm fronds, sailing quietly among crystal-clear ripples, the breeze
scented with orange blossom.

The boat was rowed upstream by a dozen oarsmen.  As they rowed they
sang traditional Sichuan opera arias and improvised songs about the
names of the villages they were passing, the legends of the hills, and
the spirits of the bamboo groves.  They sang about their moods too.  My
grandmother was most amused by the flirtatious songs they sang to one
of the female passengers, with a twinkle in their eye.  She could not
understand most of the expressions they used, because they were in
Sichuan dialect, but she could tell they were sexually suggestive by
the way the passengers gave out low laughs betraying both pleasure and
embarrassment.  She had heard about the Sichuan character, which was
supposed to be as saucy and spicy as the food.  My grandmother was in a
happy mood.  She did not know that my mother had had several close
shaves with death, nor had my mother said anything about her
miscarriage.

It was mid-May when she arrived.  The journey had taken over two
months.  My mother, who had been feeling sick and miserable, was
ecstatic at seeing her again.  My father was not so pleased.  Yibin was
the first time he had been alone with my mother in an even semi-stable
situation.  He had only just gotten away from his mother-inlaw, and now
here she was again, when he had hoped she was a thousand miles away. He
was well aware that he was no match for the bonds between mother and
daughter.

My mother was seething with resentment against my father.  Since the
bandit threat had become more acute, the quasi-military life-style had
been reinstated.  And because they were both away so much, my mother
rarely spent the night with my father.  He was traveling around the
country most of the time, investigating conditions in the rural areas,
hearing the peasants' complaints, and dealing with every kind of
problem, particularly ensuring the food supply.  Even when he was in
Yibin, my father would work late at the office.  My parents were seeing
less and less of each other, and were drifting apart again.

The arrival of my grandmother reopened old wounds.

She was allotted a room in the courtyard where my parents were living.
At the time, all officials were living on a comprehensive allowance
system called gong-ji-zhi.  They

2 x6 "Returning Home Robed in Embroidered Silk' received no salary, but
the state provided them with housing, food, clothing, and daily
necessities, plus a tiny amount of pocket money as in an army. Everyone
had to eat in canteens, where the food was meager and unappetizing.

You were not allowed to cook at home, even if you had cash from some
other source.

When my grandmother arrived she started selling some of her jewelry to
buy food in the market; she was especially keen to cook for my mother
because it was traditionally thought vital for pregnant women to eat
well.  But soon complaints started pouring in via Mrs.  Mi about my
mother being 'bourgeois' getting privileged treatment and using up
precious fuel which, like food, had to be collected from the
countryside.  She was also criticized for being 'pampered'; having her
mother there was bad for her reeducation.  My father made a
self-criticism to his Party organization and ordered my grandmother to
stop cooking at home.  My mother resented this, and so did my
grandmother.

"Can't you stand up for me just once?"  my mother said bitterly.

"The baby I am carrying is yours as well as mine, and it needs
nourishment!"  Eventually my father conceded a little: my grandmother
could cook at home twice a week, but no more.  Even this was breaking
the rules, he said.

It turned out that my grandmother was breaking a more important rule.
Only officials of a certain rank were entitled to have their parents
staying with them, and my mother did not qualify.  Because officials
did not receive salaries, the state was responsible for looking after
their dependants, and wanted to keep the numbers down.  Even though my
father was senior enough, he let his own mother continue to be
supported by Aunt Jun-ying.  My mother pointed out that her mother
would not be a burden on the state, because she had enough jewelry to
support herself, and she had been invited to stay with Aunt Jun-ying.
Mrs.  Mi said my grandmother should not be there at all and would have
to go back to Manchuria.  My father agreed.

My mother argued vehemently with him, but he said that a rule was a
rule and he would not fight to have it bent.  In old China one of the
major vices was that anyone with power was above the rules, and an
important component of the Communist revolution was that officials,
like everyone else, should be subject to rules.  My mother was in
tears.  She was afraid of having another miscarriage.

Perhaps my father could consider her safety and let her mother stay
until the birth?  Still he said no.

"Corruption always starts with lit He things like this.  This is the
sort of thing that will erode our revolution."  My mother could not
find any argument to win him over.  He has no feelings, she thought. He
does not put my interests first.  He does not love me.

My grandmother had to go, and my mother was never to forgive my father
for this.  My grandmother had been with her daughter for little more
than a month, having spent over two months traveling across China, at
the risk of her life.  She was afraid my mother might have another
miscarriage, and she did not trust the medical services in Yibin.
Before she left she went to see my aunt Jun-ying and solemnly kowtowed
to her, saying she was leaving my mother in her care.  My aunt was sad,
too.  She was worried about my mother, and wanted my grandmother to be
there for the birth.  She went to plead with her brother, but he would
not budge.

With a heavy heart, and amid bitter tears, my grandmother hobbled down
to the quay with my mother to take the little boat back down the
Yangtze on the start of the long and uncertain journey back to
Manchuria.  My mother stood on the riverbank, waving as the boat
disappeared into the mist, and wondering if she would ever see her
mother again.

It was July 195o.  My mother's one-year provisional membership in the
Party was due to end, and her Party cell was grilling her intensively.
It had only three members:

my mother, my father's bodyguard, and my mother's boss,

Mrs.  Mi.  There were so few Party members in Yibin that these three
had been thrown together rather incongruously.  The other two, who were
both full members, were leaning toward turning down my mother's
application, but they did not give a straightforward no.  They just
kept grilling her and forcing her to make endless self-criticisms.

For each self-criticism, there were many criticisms.  My mother's two
comrades insisted that she had behaved in a 'bourgeois' manner.  They
said she had not wanted to go to the country to help collect food; when
she pointed out that she had gone, in line with the Party's wishes,
they retorted: "Ah, but you didn't really want to go."  Then they
accused her of having enjoyed privileged food cooked, moreover, by her
mother at home and of succumbing to illness more than most pregnant
women.  Mrs.  Mi also criticized her because her mother had made
clothes for the baby.

"Who ever heard of a baby wearing new clothes?"

she said.

"Such a bourgeois waste!  Why can't she just wrap the baby up in old
clothes like everyone else?"  The fact that my mother had shown her
sadness that my grandmother had to leave was singled out as definitive
proof that she 'put family first," a serious offense.

The summer of 195o was the hottest in living memory, with high humidity
and temperatures above 100 F. My mother had been washing every day, and
she was attacked for this, too.  Peasants, especially in the North
where Mrs.  Mi came from, washed very rarely, because of the shortage
of water.  In the guerrillas, men and women used to compete to see who
had the most 'revolutionary insects' (lice).

Cleanliness was regarded as un proletarian  When the steamy summer
turned into cool autumn my father's bodyguard weighed in with a new
accusation: my mother was 'behaving like a Kuomintang official's grand
lady' because she had used my father's leftover hot water.  At the
time, in order to save fuel, there was a rule that only officials above
a certain rank were entitled to wash with hot water.

My father fell into this group, but my mother did not.  She had been
strongly advised by the women in my father's family not to touch cold
water when she came near to delivery time.  After the bodyguard's
criticism, my father would not let my mother use his water.  My mother
felt like screaming at him for not taking her side against the endless
intrusions into the most irrelevant recesses of her life.

The Party's all-around intrusion into people's lives was the very point
of the process known as 'thought reform."

Mao wanted not only external discipline, but the total subjection of
all thoughts, large or small.  Every week a meeting for 'thought
examination' was held for those 'in the revolution."  Everyone had both
to criticize themselves for incorrect thoughts and be subjected to the
criticism of others.

The meetings tended to be dominated by self-righteous and petty-minded
people, who used them to vent their envy and frustration; people of
peasant origin used them to attack those from 'bourgeois' backgrounds.
The idea was that people should be reformed to be more like peasants,
because the Communist revolution was in essence a peasant revolution.
This process appealed to the guilt feelings of the educated; they had
been living better than the peasants, and self-criticism tapped into
this.

Meetings were an important means of Communist control.  They left
people no free time, and eliminated the private sphere.  The pettiness
which dominated them was justified on the grounds that prying into
personal details was a way of ensuring thorough soul-cleansing.  In
fact, pettiness was a fundamental characteristic of a revolution in
which intrusiveness and ignorance were celebrated, and envy was
incorporated into the system of control.  My mother's cell grilled her
week after week, month after month, forcing her to produce endless
self-criticisms.

She had to consent to this agonizing process.  Life for a revolutionary
was meaningless if they were rejected by the Party.  It was like
excommunication for a Catholic.  Besides, it was standard procedure. My
father had gone through it and had accepted it as part of 'joining the
revolution."  In fact, he was still going through it.  The Party had
never hidden the fact that it was a painful process.  He told my mother
her anguish was normal.

At the end of all this, my mother's two comrades voted against full
Party membership for her.  She fell into a deep depression.  She had
been devoted to the revolution, and could not accept the idea that it
did not want her; it was particularly galling to think she might not
get in for completely petty and irrelevant reasons, decided by two
people whose way of thinking seemed light years away from what she had
conceived the Party's ideology to be.  She was being kept out of a
progressive organization by backward people, and yet the revolution
seemed to be telling her that it was she who was in the wrong.  At the
back of her mind was another, more practical point which she did not
even spell out to herself: it was vital to get into the Party, because
if she failed she would be stigmatized and ostracized.

With these thoughts churning through her mind, my mother came to feel
the world was against her.  She dreaded seeing people and spent as much
time as possible alone, crying to herself.  Even this she had to
conceal, as it would have been considered as showing lack of faith in
the revolution.  She found she could not blame the Party, which seemed
to her to be in the right, so she blamed my father, first for making
her pregnant and then for not standing by her when she was attacked and
rejected.  Many times she wandered along the quay, gazing down into the
muddy waters of the Yangtze, and thought of committing suicide to
punish him, picturing to herself how he would be filled with remorse
when he found she had killed herself.

The recommendation of her cell had to be approved by a higher
authority, which consisted of three open-minded intellectuals.  They
thought my mother had been treated unfairly, but the Party rules made
it difficult for them to overturn the recommendation of her cell.  So
they procrastinated.  This was relatively easy because the three were
seldom in one place at the same time.  Like my father and
the other male officials, they were usually
away in different parts of the countryside foraging for food and
fighting bandits.  Knowing that Yibin was almost undefended, and driven
to desperation by the fact that all their escape routes both to Taiwan
and through Yunnan to Indochina and Burma had been cut, a sizable army
of Kuomintang stragglers, landlords, and bandits laid siege to the
city, and for a time it looked as though it was going to fall.  My
father raced back from the countryside as soon as he heard about the
attack.

The fields started just outside the city walls and there was vegetation
to within a few yards of the gates.  Using this for cover, the
attackers managed to get right up to the walls and began to pound the
north gate with huge battering rams.  In the vanguard was the
Broadsword Brigade, consisting largely of unarmed peasants who had
drunk 'holy water' which, they believed, made them immune to bullets.
The Kuomintang soldiers were behind them.  At first the Communist army
commander tried to aim his fire at the Kuomintang, not at the peasants,
whom he hoped to scare into retreating.

Even though my mother was seven months pregnant, she joined the other
women in taking food and water to the defenders on the walls and
carrying the wounded to the rear.  Thanks to the training she had had
at school, she was good at first aid.  She was also brave.  After about
a week, the attackers abandoned the siege and the Communists
counterattacked, mopping up virtually all armed resistance in the area
for good.

Immediately after this, land reform started in the Yibin area.  The
Communists had passed an agrarian reform law that summer, which was the
key to their program for transforming China.  The basic concept, which
they called 'the land returning home," was to redistribute all
farmland, as well as draft animals and houses, so that every farmer
owned a more or less equal amount of land.  Landowners were to be
allowed to keep a plot, on the same basis as everyone else.  My father
was one of the people running the program.  My mother was excused from
going to the villages because of her advanced pregnancy.

Yibin was a rich place.  A local saying has it that with one year's
work, peasants could live at ease for two.  But decades of incessant
warfare had devastated the land; on top of this had come heavy taxes to
pay for the fighting and for the eight-year war against Japan.
Depredations had escalated when Chiang Kai-shek moved his wartime
capital to Sichuan, and corrupt officials and carpetbaggers had
descended on the province.  The last straw came when the Kuomintang
made Sichuan their final redoubt in 1949 and levied exorbitant taxes
just before the Communists arrived.  All this, plus greedy landlords,
had combined to produce appalling poverty in the rich province.  Eighty
percent of the peasants did not have enough to feed their families.  If
the crops failed, many were reduced to eating herbs and the leaves of
sweet potatoes, which were normally fed to pigs.  Starvation was
widespread, and life expectancy was only about forty years.  The
poverty in such a rich land was one of the reasons my father had been
attracted to communism in the first place.

In Yibin the land reform drive was on the whole nonviolent, partly
because the fiercer landlords had been involved in the rebellions
during the first nine months of Communist rule and had already been
killed in battle or executed.  But there was some violence.  In one
case a Party member raped the female members of a landowner's family
and then mutilated them by cutting off their breasts.  My father
ordered that the man be executed.

One bandit gang had captured a young Communist, a university graduate,
while he was out in the country looking for food.  The bandit chief
ordered him to be cut in half.

The chief was later caught, and beaten to death by the Communist land
reform team leader, who had been a friend of the man who had been
killed.  The team leader then cut out the chief's heart and ate it to
demonstrate his revenge.  My father ordered the team leader to be
dismissed from his job, but not shot.  He reasoned that while he had
engaged in a form of brutality, it was not against an innocent person
but a murderer, and a cruel one at that.

The land reform took over a year to complete.  In the majority of
cases, the worst the landlords suffered was the loss of most of their
land and their homes.  So-called open-minded landlords, those who had
not joined the armed rebellion, or who had actually helped the
Communist underground, were treated well.  My parents had friends whose
families were local landlords, and had been to dinner at their grand
old houses before they were confiscated and divided up among the
peasants.

My father was completely wrapped up in his work, and was not in town
when my mother gave birth to her first child, a girl, on 8 November.
Because Dr.  Xia had given my mother the name De-hong, which
incorporates the character for 'wild swan' (Hong) with a generation
name (De), my father named my sister Xiao-hong, which means 'to be
like' (Xiao) my mother.  Seven days after my sister's birth Aunt
Jun-ying had my mother brought home from the hospital to the Chang
house on a bamboo litter carried by two men.  When my father got back a
few weeks later, he said to my mother that, as a Communist, she should
not have allowed herself to be carried by other human beings.

She said she had done it because, according to traditional wisdom,
women were not supposed to walk for a while after a birth.  To this my
father replied: what about the peasant women who have to carry on
working in the fields immediately after they give birth?

My mother was still in a deep depression, uncertain whether she could
stay in the Party or not.  Unable to let her rage out on my father or
the Party, she blamed her baby daughter for her misery.  Four days
after they came out of the hospital, my sister cried all through the
night.

My mother was at the end of her tether, and screamed at her and smacked
her quite hard.  Aunt Jun-ying, who was sleeping in the next room,
rushed in and said: "You're exhausted.  Let me look after her."  From
then on my aunt looked after my sister.  When my mother went back to
her own place a few weeks later my sister stayed on with Aunt Jun-ying
in the family house.

To this day my mother remembers with grief and remorse the night she
hit my sister.  When my mother went to see her, Xiao-hong used to hide,
and in a tragic reversal of what had happened to her as a young child
at General Xue's mansion my mother would not allow Xiao-hong to call
her "Mother."

My aunt found a wet-nurse for my sister.  Under the allowance system
the state paid for a wet-nurse for every newborn baby in an official's
family, and also provided free physical checkups for the wet-nurses,
who were treated as state employees.  They were not servants, and did
not even have to wash diapers.  The state could afford to pay for them
since, according to the Party's rules governing people 'in the
revolution," the only ones who were allowed to marry were senior
officials, and they produced relatively few babies.

The wet-nurse was in her late teens, and her own baby had been
stillborn.  She had married into a landlord family who had now lost
their income from the land.  She did not want to work as a peasant, but
wanted to be with her husband, who taught and lived in Yibin City.
Through mutual friends she was put in touch with my aunt and went to
live in the Chang family house with her husband.

Gradually my mother began to pull out of her depression.  After the
birth she was allowed thirty days' statutory leave, which she spent
with her mother-in-law and Aunt Jun-ying.  When she went back to work
she moved to a new job in the Communist Youth League of Yibin City, in
connection with a complete reorganization of the region.

The region of Yibin, covering an area of about 7,500 square miles and
with a population of over two million, was redivided into nine rural
counties and one city, Yibin.

My father became a member of the four-man committee which governed the
whole of the region and the head of the Depa~iment of Public Affairs
for the region.

This reorganization transferred Mrs.  Mi and brought my mother a new
boss: the head of the Department of Public Affairs for the city of
Yibin, which controlled the Youth League.  In Communist China, in spite
of the formal rules, the personality of one's immediate boss was far
more important than in the West.  The boss's attitude is the Party's.
Having a nice boss makes all the difference to one's life.

My mother's new chief was a woman called Zhang Xiting.  She and her
husband had been in an army unit which was part of the force earmarked
to take Tibet in 195o.

Sichuan was the staging post for Tibet, which was considered the back
of beyond by Han Chinese.  The couple had asked to be discharged and
were sent to Yibin instead.

Her husband was called Liu Jie-ting.  He had changed his name to
Jie-ting ("Linked to Ting') to show how much he admired his wife.  The
couple became known as 'the two Tings."

In the spring my mother was promoted to head of the Youth League, an
important job for a woman not yet twenty.  She had recovered her
equilibrium and much of her old bounce.  It was in this atmosphere that
I was conceived, in June 1951.

9. "When a Man Gets Power, Even His Chickens and Do~s to
Heaven'-living

My mother was now in a new Party cell, made up of herself, Mrs.  Ting,
and a third woman who had been in the Yibin underground, with whom my
mother got on very well.  The nonstop intrusion and demands for
self-criticisms came to an immediate halt.  Her new cell quickly voted
for her to become a full Party member, and in July she was given Party
membership.

Her new boss, Mrs.  Ting, was no beauty, but her slender figure,
sensuous mouth, freckled face, lively eyes, and sharp repartee all
exuded energy and showed she was a character.  My mother warmed to her
at once.

Instead of sniping at her like Mrs.  Mi, Mrs.  Ting let my mother do
all sorts of things she wanted, like reading novels; before, readin, g
a book without a Marxist cover would bring down a rain of criticism
about being a bourgeois intellectual.  Mrs.  Ting allowed my mother
to

Living with an Incorruptible Man 227 go to the cinema on her own, which
was a great privilege, as at the time those 'with the revolution' were
allowed to see only Soviet films and even then only in organized groups
whereas the public cinemas, which were privately owned, were still
showing old American films, such as Charlie Chaplin's.  Another thing
which meant a lot to my mother was that she could now have a bath every
other day.

One day my mother went to the market with Mrs.  Ting and bought two
yards of fine pink flower-patterned cotton from Poland.  She had seen
the cloth before, but had not dared to buy it for fear of being
criticized for being frivolous.  Soon after she had reached Yibin, she
had had to hand in her army uniform and return to her "Lenin suit."

Under that she wore a shapeless, undyed, rough cotton shirt.  There was
no rule saying it was compulsory to wear this garb, but anyone who did
not do the same as everybody else would come in for criticism.  My
mother had been longing to wear a dash of color.  She and Mrs.  Ting
rushed over to the Changs' house with the cloth in a state of high
excitement.  In no time, four pretty blouses were ready, two for each
of them.  Next day they wore them under their Lenin jackets.  My mother
turned her pink collar out and spent the whole day feeling terribly
excited and nervous.

Mrs.  Ting was even more daring; she not only turned her collar outside
her uniform, but rolled up her sleeves so that a broad band of pink
showed on each arm.

My mother was staggered, almost awestruck, at this defiance.  As
expected, there were plenty of disapproving glances.  But Mrs.  Ting
held her chin up: "Who cares?"  she said to my mother.  My mother was
tremendously relieved;

with the sanction of her boss, she could ignore any criticisms, verbal
or wordless.

One reason Mrs.  Ting was not frightened of bending the rules a bit was
that she had a powerful husband, who was less scrupulous in exercising
his power.  A sharp-nosed, sharp-chinned, and slightly hunched man of
my father's age, Mr.  Ting was head of the Party Organization
Department for the region of Yibin, which was a very important
position, as this department was in charge of promotions, demotions,
and punishments.  It also kept the files of Party members.  In
addition, Mr.  Ting, like my father, was a member of the four-man
committee governing the region of Yibin.

In the Youth League my mother was working with people her own age. They
were better educated, more carefree, and more ready to see the humorous
side of things than the older, self-righteous, peasant-turned
Party-official women she had been working with before.

Her new colleagues liked dancing, they went on picnics together, and
they enjoyed talking about books and ideas.

Having a responsible job also meant my mother was treated with more
respect, and this increased as people realized that she was extremely
capable as well as dynamic.

As she grew to be more confident and to rely less on my father, she
felt less disappointed with him.  Besides, she was getting used to his
attitudes; she had stopped expecting him always to put her first, and
was much more at peace with the world.

Another bonus of my mother's promotion was that it qualified her to
bring her mother to Yibin on a permanent basis.  At the end of August z
95 x, after an exhausting journey, my grandmother and Dr.  Xia arrived;
the transportation system was working properly again and they had
traveled the whole way by regular train and boat.  As dependants of a
government official, they were assigned lodgings at the state's
expense, a three-room house in a guesthouse compound.  They received a
free ration of basic goods, like rice and fuel, which were delivered to
them by the manager of the compound, and they were also given a small
allowance to buy other food.  My sister and her wet-nurse went to live
with them, and my mother spent most of her brief spare time there,
enjoying my grandmother's delicious cooking.

My mother was delighted to have her mother and Dr.  Xia, whom she loved
with her.  She was particularly glad that they were no longer in
Jinzhou, as war had recently broken out in Korea, on the doorstep of
Manchuria; at one point in late 195o American troops had stood on the
banks of the Yalu River, on the border between Korea and China, and
American planes had bombed and strafed towns in Manchuria.

One of the first things my mother wanted to know was what had happened
to Hui-ge, the young colonel.  She was devastated to hear that he had
been executed by firing squad, by the bend in the river outside the
western gate of Jinzhou.

For the Chinese, one of the most terrible things that could happen was
not to have a proper burial.  They believed that only when the body was
covered and placed deep in the earth could the dead find peace.  This
was a religious feeling, but it also had a practical side: if the body
was not buried, it would be torn to pieces by wild dogs and picked to
the bone by birds.  In the past, the bodies of people who had been
executed had traditionally been exposed for three days as a lesson to
the population; only then were the corpses collected and given a sort
of burial.

Now the Communists issued an order that the family should immediately
bury an executed relative; if they could not do it, the task was
carried out by grave diggers hired by the government.

My grandmother had gone herself to the execution ground.  Hui-ge's body
had been left lying on the ground, fiddled with bullets, one of a row
of corpses.  He had been shot along with fifteen other people.  Their
blood had stained the snow dark red.  There was no one from his family
left in the city, so my grandmother had hired professional undertakers
to give him a decent burial.  She herself brought a long piece of red
silk in which to wrap his body.  My mother asked if there were other
people she knew there.  Yes, there had been.  My grandmother had z3o
"When a Man Gets Power..."

bumped into a woman she knew who was collecting the corpses of her
husband and her brother.  Both had been Kuomintang district chiefs.

My mother was also horrified to hear that my grandmother had been
denounced by her own sister-in-law, Yu-lin's wife.  She had long felt
put-upon by my grandmother, as she had to do the hard work around the
house, while my grandmother ran it as its mistress.  The Communists had
urged everyone to speak up about 'oppression and exploitation," so Mrs.
Yu-lin's grudges were given a political framework.  When my grandmother
collected Hui-ge's corpse Mrs.  Yu-lin denounced her for being well
disposed toward a criminal.  The neighborhood gathered to hold a
'struggle meeting' to 'help' my grandmother understand her 'faults." 
My grandmother had to attend, but wisely decided to say nothing and
appear meekly to accept the criticism.  Inwardly, she was fuming
against her sister-in-law and the Communists.

The episode did not help relations between my grandmother and my
father.  When he found out what she had done, he was enraged, saying
she was more in sympathy with the Kuomintang than with the Communists.
But it was obvious that he also felt a twinge of jealousy.  While she
hardly spoke to my father, my grandmother had been very fond of Hui-ge
and had considered him a good match for my mother.

My mother was caught in the middle between her mother and her husband;
and between her personal feelings, her grief over Hui-ge's death, and
her political feelings, her commitment to the Communists.

The execution of the colonel was part of a campaign to 'suppress
counterrevolution ari  Its goal was to eliminate all supporters of the
Kuomintang who had had power or influence, and it was triggered by the
Korean War, which had started in June 195o.  When US troops had come
right up to the Manchurian border Mao had feared the United States
might attack China, or unleash Chiang Kai-shek's army against the
mainland, or both.  He sent over a million men into Korea to fight on
the side of the North Koreans against the Americans.

Although Chiang Kai-shek's army never left Taiwan, the United States
did organize an invasion into southwest China by Kuomintang forces from
Burma; raids were also frequent in the coastal areas, many agents were
landed, and acts of sabotage increased.  Large numbers of Kuomintang
soldiers and bandits were still at large and there were sizable
rebellions in parts of the hinterland.  The Communists worried that
supporters of the Kuomintang might try to topple their newly
established order, and that if Chiang Kai-shek tried to stage a
comeback they would rise up as a fifth column.  They also wanted to
show people that they were there to stay, and getting rid of their
opponents was one way to impress the concept of stability on the
population, who had traditionally yearned for it.  However, opinions
were divided about the degree of ruthlessness necessary.  The new
government decided not to be fainthearted.  As one official document
put it: "If we do not kill them they will come back and kill us."

My mother was not convinced by the argument, but she decided there was
not much point trying to talk to my father about it.  In fact she
rarely saw him, as he spent much of the time away in the countryside,
troubleshooting.

Even when he was in town, she did not see much of him.

Officials were supposed to work from 8 a.m. until 11 p.m., seven days
a week, and one or both of them usually came home so late they hardly
had time to talk to each other.

Their baby daughter did not live with them, and they ate in the
canteen, so there was almost nothing one could call a home life.

Once the land reform was completed, my father was off again,
supervising the construction of the first proper road through the
region.  Formerly, the only link between Yibin and the outside world
had been by river.  The government decided to build a road south to the
province of Yunnan.

In only one year, using no machinery at all, they built over eighty
miles through a very hilly area, with numerous rivers.  The labor force
was made up of peasants, who worked in exchange for food.

During the digging, the peasants hit the skeleton of a dinosaur, which
got slightly damaged.  My father made a self-criticism and ensured it
was excavated carefully and shipped to a museum in Peking.  He also
sent soldiers to guard some tombs dating from about ~ zoo from which
the peasants had been taking bricks to improve their pigsties.

One day two peasants were killed by a rock slide.  My father walked
through the night along mountain paths to the scene of the accident.
This was the first time in their lives the local peasants had set eyes
on an official of my father's rank, and they were moved to see that he
was concerned about their well-being.  In the past it had been assumed
that all officials were only out to line their pockets.

After what my father did, the locals thought the Communists were
marvelous.

Meanwhile, one of my mother's main jobs was to galvanize support for
the new government, particularly among factory workers.  From the
beginning of 1951 she had been visiting factories, making speeches,
listening to complaints, and sorting out problems.  Her job included
explaining to the young workers what communism was and encouraging them
to join the Youth League and the Party.  She lived for long periods in
a couple of factories: Communists were supposed to 'live and work among
the workers and peasants," as my father was doing, and to know their
needs.

One factory just outside the city made insulating circuits.

Living conditions there, as in every other factory, were appalling,
with scores of women sleeping in a huge shack built of straw and
bamboo.  The food was woefully inadequate: the workers got meat only
about twice a month, even though they were doing exhausting work.  Many
of the women had to stand in cold water for eight hours at a stretch
washing the porcelain insulators.  Tuberculosis, from malnutrition and
lack of hygiene, was common.  The eating bowls and chopsticks were
never properly washed and were all mixed up together.

In March my mother began to cough up a little blood.

She knew at once that she had TB, but she kept on working.  She was
happy because no one was intruding on her life.  She believed in what
she was doing, and she was excited by the results of her work:
conditions in the factory were improving, the young workers liked her,
and many pledged their allegiance to the Communist cause as the result
of her.  She genuinely felt that the revolution needed her devotion and
self-sacrifice, and she worked flat out, all day, seven days a week.
But after working without a break for months, it became obvious that
she was extremely ill.

Four cavities had developed in her lungs.  By the summer she was also
pregnant with me.

One day in late November my mother fainted on the factory floor.  She
was rushed to a small hospital in the city which had originally been
set up by foreign missionaries.

There she was looked after by Chinese Catholics.  There was still one
European priest there, and a few European nuns, wearing religious
habits.  Mrs.  Ting encouraged my grandmother to bring her food, and my
mother ate an enormous amount- a whole chicken, ten eggs, and a pound
of meat a day sometimes.  As a result, I became gigantic in her womb
and she put on thirty pounds.

The hospital had a small amount of American medicine for TB.  Mrs. Ting
charged in and got hold of the whole lot for my mother.  When my father
found out he asked Mrs.  Ting to take at least half of it back, but she
snapped at him: "What sense does that make?  As it is, this is not
enough for one person.  If you don't believe me, you can go and ask the
doctor.  Besides, your wife works under me and I am making the
decisions about her."  My mother was enormously grateful to Mrs.  Ting
for standing up to my father.  He did not insist.  He was obviously
torn between concern for my mother's health and his principles,
according to which his wife's interest must not override that of the
ordinary people, and at least some of the medicine ought to be saved
for others.

Because of my huge size and the way I grew upward, the cavities in her
lungs were compressed and started to close.  The doctors told her this
was a compliment to her baby, but my mother thought the credit should
probably go to the American medicine she had been able to take, thanks
to Mrs.  Ting.  My mother stayed in the hospital three months, until
February 1952, when she was eight months pregnant.  One day she was
suddenly asked to leave, 'for her own safety."  A friend told her that
some guns had been found in the residence of a foreign priest in
Peking, and all foreign priests and nuns had fallen under extreme
suspicion.

She did not want to leave.  The hospital was set in a pretty garden
with beautiful water lilies, and she found the professional care and
the clean environment, which were rare in China at that time, extremely
soothing.  But she had no choice, and was moved to the Number One
People's Hospital.  The director of this hospital had never delivered a
baby before.  He had been a doctor with the Kuomintang army until his
unit had mutinied and gone over to the Communists.  He was worried that
if my mother died giving birth, he would be in dire trouble because of
his background and because my father was a high official.

Near the date when I was due to appear, the director suggested to my
father that my mother should be moved to a hospital in a larger city,
where there were better facilities and specialist obstetricians.  He
was afraid that when I emerged, the sudden removal of pressure might
cause the cavities in my mother's lung to reopen and produce a
hemorrhage.  But my father refused; he said his wife had to be treated
like anyone else, as the Communists had pledged themselves to combat
privilege.  When my mother heard this she thought bitterly that he
always seemed to act against her interest and that he did not care
whether she lived or died.

I was born on 25 March 1952.  Because of the complexi~' of the case, a
second surgeon was invited in from another hospital.  Several other
doctors were present, along with staff with extra oxygen and blood
transfusion equipment, and Mrs.  Ting.  Chinese men traditionally did
not attend births, but the director asked my father to stand by outside
the delivery room because it was a special case and to protect himself
in case anything went wrong.  It was a very difficult delivery.  When
my head came out, my shoulders, which were unusually broad, got caught.
And I was too fat.

The nurses pulled my head with their hands, and I came out squeezed
blue and purple, and half strangled.  The doctors placed me first in
hot water, then in cold water, and lifted me up by my feet and smacked
me hard.  Eventually I started crying, very loudly, too.  They all
laughed with relief.

I weighed just over ten pounds.  My mother's lungs were undamaged.

A woman doctor picked me up and showed me to my father, whose first
words were: "Oh dear, this child has bulging eyes!"  My mother was very
upset at this remark.

Aunt Jun-ying said, "No, she just has beautiful big eyes!"

As for every occasion and condition in China, there was a particular
dish considered just right for a woman immediately after she had given
birth: poached eggs in raw sugar juice with fermented glutinous rice.
My grandmother prepared these in the hospital, which, like all
hospitals, had kitchens where patients and their families could cook
their own food, and had them ready the minute my mother was able to
eat.

When the news of my birth reached Dr.  Xia, he said:

"All, another wild swan is born."  I was given the name Er-hong, which
means "Second Wild Swan."

Giving me my name was almost the last act in Dr.  Xia's long life. Four
days after I was born he died, at the age of eighty-two.  He was
leaning back in bed drinking a glass of milk.  My grandmother went out
of the room for a minute and when she came back to get the glass she
saw the milk had spilled and the glass had fallen to the floor.  He had
died instantly and painlessly.

Funerals were very important events in China.  Ordinary people would
often bankrupt themselves to lay on a grand ceremony and my grandmother
loved Dr.  Xia and wanted to do him proud.  There were three things she
absolutely insisted on: first, a good coffin; second, that the coffin
must be carried by pallbearers and not pulled on a cart; and third, to
have Buddhist monks to chant the sutras for the dead and musicians to
play the mona, a piercing woodwind ins manent traditionally used at
funerals.  My father agreed to the first and second requests, but
vetoed the third.  The Communists regarded any extravagant ceremony as
wasteful and 'feudal."  Traditionally, only very lowly people were
buried quietly.  Noise-making was considered important at a funeral to
make it a public affair:, this brought 'face' and also showed respect
for the dead.  My father insisted there could be no suona or monks.  My
grandmother had a blazi g row with him.  For her, these were essentials
which she just had to have.  In the mid die of the altercation she
fainted from anger and grief.  She was also wrought up because she was
all alone at the saddest moment of her life.  She had not told my
mother what had happened, for fear of upsetting her, and the fact that
my mother was in the hospital meant that my grandmother had to deal
directly with my father.  After the funeral she had a nervous breakdown
and had to be hospitalized for almost two months.

Dr.  Xia was buried in a cemetery on top of a hill on the edge of
Yibin, overlooking the Yangtze.  His grave was shaded by pines,
cypresses, and camphor trees.  In his short time in Yibin Dr.  Xia had
won the love and respect of all who knew him.  When he died, the
manager of the guesthouse where he had been living arranged
everything

Lh'ing with an Incorruptible Man 237 for my grandmother and led his
staff in the silent tuner al procession.

Dr.  Xia had been happy in his old age.  He loved Yibin and took
tremendous pleasure in all the exotic flowers which flourished in the
subtropical climate, so different from Manchuria.  Right up until the
very end he enjoyed extraordinarily good health.  He had had a good
life in Yibin, with his own house and courtyard rent free; he and my
grandmother were well looked after, with abundant supplies of food
delivered to their home.  It was the dream of every Chinese, in a
society without any social security, to be cared for in old age.  Dr.
Xia was able to enjoy this, and it was no small thing.

Dr.  Xia had got on very well with everybody, including my father, who
respected him enormously as a man of principle.  Dr.  Xia considered my
father a very knowledgeable man.  He used to say he had seen many
officials in the past, but never one like my father.  Common wisdom had
it that 'there is no official who is not corrupt," but my father never
abused his position, not even to look after the interests of his own
family.

The two men would talk together for hours.  They shared many ethical
values, but whereas my father's were dressed in the garb of an
ideology, Dr.  Xia's rested on a humanitarian foundation.  Once Dr. Xia
said to my father: "I think the Communists have done many good things. 
But you have killed too many people.  People who should not have been
killed."

"Like who?"  my father asked.

"Those masters in the Society of Reason," which was the quasi-religious
sect to which Dr.  Xia had belonged.  Its leaders had been executed as
part of the campaign to 'suppress counterrevolution ari  The new regime
suppressed all secret societies, because they commanded loyalties, and
the Communists did not want divided loyalties.

"They were not bad people, and you should have let the Society be," Dr.
Xia said.  There was a long pause.

My father tried to defend the Communists, saying that the struggle with
the Kuomintang was a matter of life and death.

Dr.  Xia could tell that my father was not fully convinced himself, but
felt he had to defend the Party.

When my grandmother left the hospital she came to live with my parents.
My sister and her wet-nurse also moved in.  I shared a room with my
wet-nurse, who had had her own baby twelve days before I was born and
had taken the job because she desperately needed money.  Her husband, a
manual worker, was in jail for gambling and dealing in opium, both of
which had been outlawed by the Communists.  Yibin had been a major
center of the opium trade, with an estimated 25,000 addicts, and opium
had previously circulated as money.  Opium dealing had been closely
linked to gangsters and provided a substantial portion of the
Kuomintang's budget.  Within two years of coming to Yibin the
Communists wiped out opium smoking.

There was no social security or unemployment benefit for someone in the
position of my wet-nurse.  But when she came to us the state paid her
salary, which she sent to her mother-in-law, who was looking after her
baby.  My nurse was a tiny woman with fine skin, unusually big round
eyes, and long exuberant hair, which she kept in a bun.

She was a very kind woman, and treated me like her own daughter.

Traditionally, square shoulders were regarded as unbecoming for girls,
so my shoulders were bound tightly to make them grow into the required
sloppy shape.  This made me bawl so loudly that my nurse would release
my arms and shoulders, allowing me to wave at people who came to the
house, and clutch them, which I liked doing from an early age.  My
mother always attributed my outgoing character to the fact that she was
happy when she was pregnant with me.

We were living in the old landlord's mansion where my father had his
office; it had a big garden with Chinese pepper trees, banana groves,
and lots of sweet-smelling flowers and subtropical plants, which were
looked after by a gardener provided by the government.  My father greys
his own tomatoes and chiles.  He enjoyed this work, but it was also one
of his principles that a Communist official should perform physical
labor, which had traditionally been looked down on by mandarins.

My father was very affectionate to me.  When I began to crawl, he would
lie on his stomach to be my 'mountains," and I would climb up and down
him.

Soon after I was born my father was promoted to become the governor of
the Yibin region, the number-two man in the area, below only the first
secretary of the Party.  (The Party and the government were formally
distinct, but actually inseparable.)

When he had first returned to Yibin, his family and old friends all
expected him to help them.  In China it was assumed that anyone in a
powerful position would look after their relatives.  There was a
well-known saying: "When a man gets power, even his chickens and dogs
rise to heaven."  But my father felt that nepotism and favoritism were
the slippery slope to corruption, which was the root of all the evils
of the old China.  He also knew that the local people were watching him
to see how the Communism would behave, and that what he did would
influence how they regarded communism.

His strictness had already estranged him from his family.

One of his cousins had asked him for a recommendation for a job in the
box office at a local cinema.  My father told him to go through the
official channels.  Such behavior was unheard of, and after this no one
ever asked him for a favor again.  Then something else happened soon
after he was appointed governor.  One of his older brothers was a tea
expert who worked in a tea marketing office.  The economy was doing
well in the early 195os, production was expanding, and the local tea
board wanted to promote him to manager.  All promotions above a certain
level had to be cleared by my father.  When the recommendation landed

24o "When a Man Gets Power..."

on his desk, he vetoed it.  His family was incensed, and so was my
mother.

"It's not you who is promoting him, it's his management!"  she
exploded.

"You don't have to help him, but you don't have to block him either!"
My father said that his brother was not capable enough and that he
would not have been put forward for promotion if he had not been the
governor's brother.  There was a long tradition of anticipating the
wishes of one's superiors, he pointed out.

The tea management board was indignant because my father's action
implied that their recommendation had ulterior motives.  My father
ended up offending everyone, and his brother never spoke to him
again.

But my father was unrepentant.  He was fighting his own crusade against
the old ways, and he insisted on treating everyone by the same
criteria.  But there was no objective standard for fairness, so he
relied on his own instincts, bending over backward to be fair.  He did
not consult his colleagues, partly because he knew that none of them
would ever tell him that a relative of his was undeserving.

His personal moral crusade reached its zenith in 1953 when a civil
service ranking system was instituted.  All officials and government
employees were divided into twenty-six grades.  The pay of the lowest
grade, Grade 26, was one-twentieth of that of the highest grade.  But
the real difference lay in the subsidies and perks.  The system
determined almost everything: from whether one's coat was made of
expensive wool or cheap cotton to the size of one's apariment and
whether it had an indoor toilet or not.

The grading also determined every official's access to information.  A
very important part of the Chinese Communist system was that all
information was not only very tightly controlled, but highly
compatia~tentalized and rationed, not only to the general public who
were told very little but also within the Party.

Although its eventual significance was not apparent, even at the time
civil servants could feel that the grading system was going to be
crucial to their lives, and they were
all nervous about what grade they
would get.  My father, whose grade had already been set at 11 by
higher authorities, was in charge of vetting the rankings proposed for
everyone in the Yibin region.  These included the husband of his
youngest sister, who was his favorite.  He demoted him two grades.  My
mother's department had recommended my mother to be Grade i5; he
relegated her to Grade 17.

This grade system is not directly linked to a person's position in the
civil service.  Individuals could be promoted without necessarily being
upgraded.  In nearly four decades, my mother was upgraded only twice,
in 1962 and 198z; each time she moved up only one grade, and by 199o
she was still Grade z5.  With this ranking, in the 198OS, she was not
entitled to buy a plane ticket or a 'soft seat' on a train: these can
be bought only by officials of Grade z4 and above.  So, thanks to my
father's actions in 1953, almost forty years later she was one rung too
low on the ladder to travel in comfort in her own country.  She could
not stay in a hotel room which had a private bath, as these were for
Grade 13 and above.  When she applied to change the electric meter in
her apartment to one with a larger capacity, the management of the
block told her that only officials of Grade x3 and above were entitled
to a bigger meter.

The very acts which infuriated my father's family were deeply
appreciated by the local population, and his reputation has endured to
this day.  One day in 1952 the headmaster of the Number One Middle
School mentioned to my father that he was having difficulty finding
accommodations for his teachers.

"In that case, take my family's house it's too big for only three
people," my father said instantly, in spite of the fact that the three
people were his mother, his sister Jun-ying, and a brother who was
retarded, and that they all adored the beautiful house with its
enchanted garden.  The school was delighted; his family less so,
although he found them a small house in the middle of town.  His mother
was not too pleased, but being a gracious and understanding woman, she
said nothing.

Not every official was as incorruptible as my father.

Quite soon after taking power, the Communists found themselves facing a
crisis.  They had attracted the support of millions of people by
promising clean government, but some officials began taking bribes or
bestowing favors on their families and friends.  Others threw
extravagant banquets, which is a traditional Chinese indulgence, almost
a disease, and a way of both entertaining and showing of fall at the
expense, and in the name, of the state, at a time when the government
was extremely short of funds; it was trying to reconstruct the
shattered economy and also fight a major war in Korea, which was eating
up about 50 percent of the budget.

Some officials started embezzling on a large scale.  The regime was
worried.  It sensed that the goodwill which had swept it into power and
the discipline and dedication which had ensured its success were
eroding.  In late 195I it decided to launch a movement against
corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.  It was called the "Three Antis
Campaign."  The government executed some corrupt officials, imprisoned
quite a number, and dismissed many others.

Even some veterans of the Communist army who had been involved in
large-scale bribery or embezzlement were executed, to set an example.
Henceforth, corruption was severely punished, and it became rare among
officials for the next couple of decades.

My father was in charge of the campaign in his region.

There were no corrupt senior officials in his area, but he felt it was
important to demonstrate that the Communists were keeping their promise
to provide clean government.

Every official had to make a self-criticism about any infraction,
however minor: for example, if they had used an office telephone to
make a personal call, or a piece of official notepaper to write a
private letter.  Officials became so scrupulous about using state
property that most of them would not even use the ink in their office
to write anything except official communications.  When they switched
from official business to something personal they changed pens.

There was a puritanical zeal about sticking to these prescriptions.  My
father felt that through these minutiae they were creating a new
attitude among the Chinese: public property would, for the first time,
be strictly separate from private; officials would no longer treat the
people's money as their own, or abuse their positions.  Most of the
people who worked with my father took this position, and genuinely
believed that their painstaking efforts were directly linked to the
noble cause of creating a new China.

The Three Antis Campaign was aimed at people in the Party.  But it
takes two to make a corrupt transaction, and the corrupters were often
outside the Party, especially 'capitalists," factory owners and
merchants, who had still hardly been touched.  Old habits were deeply
entrenched.

In spring 1952, soon after the Three Antis Campaign got go' rag
another, overlapping campaign was started.  This was called the "Five
Antis' and was aimed at capitalists.

The five targets were bribery, tax evasion, fraud, theft of state
property, and obtaining economic information through corruption.  Most
capitalists were found to have committed one or more of these offenses,
and the punishment was usually a fine.  The Communists used this
campaign to coax and (more often) cow the capitalists, but in such a
way as to maximize their usefulness to the economy.

Not many were imprisoned.

These two linked campaigns consolidated mechanisms of control,
originally developed in the early days of communism, which were unique
to China.  The most important was the 'mass campaign'
(qiun-zhongyun-dong), which was conducted by bodies known as 'work
teams' (gong-zuo-zu).

Work teams were ad hoc bodies, made up mainly of employees from
government offices and headed by senior Party officials.  The central
government in Peking would send teams to the provinces to vet the
provincial officials and employees.  These, in turn, formed teams which
checked up on the next level, where the process was repeated, all the
way down to the grass roots.  Normally, no one could become a member of
a work team who had not already been vetted in that particular
campaign.

Teams were sent to all organizations where the campaign was to be
conducted 'to mobilize the people."  There were compulsory meefngs most
evenings to study instructions issued by the top authorities.  Team
members would talk, lecture, and try to persuade people to stand up and
expose suspects.  People were encouraged to place anonymous complaints
in boxes provided for the purpose.  The work team would investigate
each case.  If the investigation confirmed the charge, or revealed
grounds for suspicion, the team would formulate a verdict which was
sent up to the next level of authority for approval.

There was no genuine appeal system, although a person who came under
suspicion could ask to see the evidence and would usually be allowed to
make some sort of defense.

Work teams could impose a range of sentences including public
criticism, dismissal from one's job, and various forms of surveillance;
the maximum sentence they could give was to send a person to the
countryside to do physical labor.  Only the most serious cases went to
the formal judicial system, which was under the Party's control.  For
each of the campaigns, a set of guidelines was issued from the very
top, and the work teams had to abide strictly by these.  But when it
came down to individual cases, the judgment and even the temperament-
of the specific work team could also be important.

In each campaign everyone in the category which had been designated as
the target by Peking came under some degree of scrufny, mostly from
their work mates and neighbors rather than the police.  This was a key
invention of

Mao's to involve the entire population in the machinery of control. Few
wrongdoers, according to the regime's criteria, could escape the
watchful eyes of the people,

especially in a society with an age-old concierge mentality-.

But the 'efficiency' was acquired at a tremendous price:

because the campaigns operated on very vague criteria, and because of
personal vendettas, and even gossip, many innocent people were
condemned.

Aunt Jun-ying had been working as a weaver to help support her mother,
her retarded brother, and herself.

Every night she worked into the small hours, and her eyes became quite
badly damaged from the dim light.  By 1952 she had saved and borrowed
enough money to buy two more weaving machines, and had two friends
working with her.  Although they divided the income, in theory my aunt
was paying them because she owned the machines.  In the Five Antis
Campaign anyone employing other people fell under some sort of
suspicion.  Even very small businesses like Aunt Jun-ying's, which were
in effect cooperatives, came under investigation.  She wanted to ask
her friends to leave, but did not want them to feel she was giving them
the sack.  But then the two friends told her it would be best if they
left.  They were worried that if someone else threw mud at her, she
might think it was them.

By the middle of 1953 the Three Antis and Five Antis campaigns had
wound down; the capitalists had been brought to heel, and the
Kuomintang had been eradicated.

Mass meetings were coming to an end, as officials had come to recognize
that much of the information which emerged at them was unreliable.
Cases were being examined on an individual basis.

In May 1953 my mother went into hospital to have her third child, who
was born on 23 May: a boy called Jinming.  It was the missionary
hospital where she had stayed when she was pregnant with me, but the
missionaries had now been expelled, as had happened all over China.  My
mother had just been given a promotion to head of the Public Affairs
Department for the city of Yibin, still working under Mrs.  Ting, who
had risen to be Party secretary for the city.  At the time my
grandmother was also in the hospital with severe asthma.  And so was I,
with a navel infection; my wet-nurse was staying with me in the
hospital.  We were being given good treatment, which was free, as we
belonged to a family 'in the revolution."  Doctors tended to give the
very scarce hospital beds to officials and their families.  There was
no public health service for the majority of the population: peasants,
for example, had to pay.

My sister and my auntJun-ying were staying with friends in the country,
so my father was alone at home.  One day Mrs.  Ting came to report on
her work.  Afterward she said she had a headache and wanted to lie
down.  My father helped her onto one of the beds, and as he did so she
pulled him down toward her and tried to kiss and stroke him.  My father
backed away at once.

"You must be very exhausted," he said, and immediately left the room. A
few moments later he returned, in a very agitated state.  He was
carrying a glass of water which he put on the bedside table.

"You must know that I love my wife," he said, and then, before Mrs.
Ting had a chance to do anything, he went to the door and closed it
behind him.  Under the glass of water he had left a piece of paper with
the words "Communist morality."

A few days later my mother left the hospital.  As she and her baby son
crossed the threshold of the house, my father said: "We're leaving
Yibin the minute we can, for good."

My mother could not imagine what had got into him.  He told her what
had happened, and said Mrs.  Ting had been eyeing him for some time. My
mother was more shocked than angry.

"But why do you want to leave so urgently?"

she asked.

"She's a determined woman," my father said.

"I'm afraid she might try again.  And she is also a vindictive woman.
What I am most worried about is that she might try to harm you.  That
would be easy, because you work under her."

"Is she that bad?"  my mother replied.

"I' did hear some gossip that when she was in jail under the

Kuomintang she seduced the warder, that sort of thing.

But some people like to spread rumors.  Anyway, I'm not surprised she
should fancy you," she smiled.

"But do you think she would really turn nasty on me?  She is my best
friend here."

"You don't understand there is something called "rage out of being
shamed" [nao-xiu-cheng-nu].  I know that is how she is feeling.  I
wasn't very tactful.  I must have shamed her.  I'm sorry.  On the spur
of the moment I acted on impulse, I'm afraid.  She is a woman who will
take revenge."

My mother could visualize exactly how my father might have abruptly
rebuffed Mrs.  Ting.  But she could not imagine Mrs.  Ting would be
that malicious, nor could she see what disaster Mrs.  Ting could bring
down on them.  So my father told her about his predecessor as governor
of Yibin, Mr.  Shu.

Mr.  Shu had been a poor peasant who had joined the Red Army on the
Long March.  He did not like Mrs.  Ting, and criticized her for being
flirtatious.  He also objected to the way she wound her hair into many
6ny plaits, which verged on the outrageous for the 6me.  Several times
he said that she should cut her plaits.  She refused, telling him to
mind his own business, which only made him redouble his criticisms,
making her even more hostile to him.  She decided to take revenge on
him, with the help of her husband.

There was a woman working in Mr.  Shu's office who had been the
concubine of a Kuomintang official who had fled to Taiwan.  She had
been seen trying her charms on Mr.  Shu, who was married, and there was
gossip about them having an affair.  Mrs.  Ting got this woman to sign
a statement saying that Mr.  Shu had made advances to her and had
forced her to have sex with him.  Even though he was the governor, the
woman decided the Tings were more fearsome.  Mr.  Shu was charged with
using his position to have relations with a former Kuomintang
concubine, which was considered inexcusable for a Communist veteran.

A standard technique in China to bring a person down was to draw
together several different charges to make the case appear more
substantial.  The Tings found another 'offense' with which to charge
Mr.  Shu.  He had once disagreed with a policy put forward by Peking
and had written to the top Party leaders stating his views.  According
to the Party charter, this was his right; moreover, as a veteran of the
Long March, he was in a privileged position.  So he felt confident that
he could be quite open with his complaints.  The Tings used this to
claim that he was opposed to the Party.

Stringing the two charges together, Mr.  Ting proposed expelling Mr.
Shu from the Party and sacking him.  Mr.  Shu denied the charges
vigorously.  The first, he said, was simply untrue.  He had never made
a pass at the woman;

all he had done was to be civil to her.  As for the second, he had done
nothing wrong and had no intention of opposing the Party.  The Party
Committee that governed the region was composed of four people: Mr. Shu
himself, Mr.  Ting, my father, and the first secretary.  Now Mr. Shu
was judged by the other three.  My father defended him.  He felt sure
Mr.  Shu was innocent, and he regarded writing the letter as completely
legitimate.

When it came to the vote, my father lost, and Mr.  Shu was dismissed.
The first secretary of the Party supported Mr.  Ting.  One reason he
did so was that Mr.  Shu had been in the 'wrong' branch of the Red
Army.  He had been a senior officer in what was called the Fourth Front
in Sichuan in the early 193OS.  This army had joined forces with the
branch of the Red Army led by Mao on the Long March in 1935.  Its
commander, a flamboyant figure called Zhang Guo-tao, challenged Mao for
the leadership of the Red Army and lost.  He then left the Long March
with his troops.  Eventually, after suffering heavy casualties, he was
forced to rejoin Mao.  But in 1938, after the Communists reached
Yan'an, he went over to the Kuomintang.  Because of this, anyone who
had been in the Fourth Front bore a stigma, and their allegiance to Mao
was considered suspect.  This issue was particularly touchy, as many of
the people in the Fourth Front had come from Sichuan.

After the Communists took power this type of unspoken stigma was
attached to any part of the revolution which Mao had not directly
controlled, including the underground, which included many of the
bravest, most dedicated and best educated Communists.  In Yibin, all
the former members of the underground felt under some sort of pressure.
Among the added complications was the fact that many of the people in
the local underground had come from well-to-do backgrounds, and their
families had suffered at the hands of the Communists.  Moreover,
because they were usually better educated than the people who had
arrived with the Communist army, who were mainly from peasant
backgrounds and often illiterate, they became the object of envy.

Though himself a guerrilla fighter, my father was instinctively much
closer to the underground people.  In any case, he refused to go along
with the insidious ostracism, and spoke out for the former members of
the underground.

"It is ridiculous to divide Communists into "underground" and over
ground he often said.  In fact, most of the people he picked to work
with him had been in the underground, because they were the most
able.

My father thought that to consider Fourth Front men like Mr.  Shu as
suspect was unacceptable, and he fought to have him rehabilitated.
First, he advised him to leave Yibin to avoid further trouble, which he
did, taking his last meal with my family.  He was transferred to
Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, where he was given a job as a
clerk in the Provincial Forestry Bureau.  From there he wrote appeals
to the Central Committee in Peking, naming my father as his reference.
My father wrote supporting his appeal.  Much later, Mr.  Shu was
cleared of 'opposing the Party," but the lesser charge of 'having
extramarital affairs' stood.  The former concubine who had lodged the
accusation dared not retract it, but she gave a patently feeble and
incoherent account of the alleged advances, which was clearly designed
to signal to the investigating group that the accusations were untrue.
Mr.  Shu was given a fairly senior post in the Forestry Ministry in
Peking, but he did not get his old position back.

The point my father was trying to get across to my mother was that the
Tings would stop at nothing to set He old scores.  He gave more
examples and repeated that they had to leave at once.  The very next
day he traveled to Chengdu, one day's journey to the north.  There he
went straight to the governor of the province, whom he knew well, and
asked to be transferred, saying that it was very difficult to work in
his hometown and to cope with the expectations of his many relatives.
He kept his real reasons to himself, as he had no hard evidence about
the Tings.

The governor, Lee Daozhang, was the man who had originally sponsored
the application by Mao's wife, Jiang (~mg, to join the Party.  He
expressed sympathy with my father's position and said he would help him
get a transfer, but he did not want him to move immediately: all the
suitable posts in Chengdu had been filled.  My father said he could not
wait, and would accept anything.  After trying hard to dissuade him,
the governor finally gave up and told him he could have the job of head
of the Arts and Education Office.  But he warned, "This is much below
your ability."  My father said he did not mind as long as there was a
job to do.

My father was so worried that he did not go back to

Yibin at all, but sent a message to my mother telling her to join him
as soon as possible.  The women in his family said it was out of the
question for my mother to move so soon after giving birth, but my
father was terrified about what Mrs.  Ting might do, and as soon as the
traditional month's postnatal convalescence was over, he sent his
bodyguard to Yibin to collect us.

It was decided that my brother Jin-ming would stay behind, as he was
considered too young to travel.  Both his wet-nurse and my sister's
wanted to stay, to be near their families.  Jin-ming's wet-nurse was
very fond of him, and she asked my mother if she could keep him with
her.  My mother agreed.  She had complete confidence in her.

My mother, my grandmother, my sister, and I, with my wet-nurse and the
bodyguard, left Yibin before dawn one night at the end of June.  We all
crammed into a jeep with our meager luggage, just a couple of
suitcases.  At the time, officials like my parents did not own any
property at all only a few articles of basic clothing.  We drove over
potholed dirt roads until we reached the town of Neijiang in the
morning.  It was a sweltering day, and we had to wait there for hours
for the train.

Just as it was finally coming into the station, I suddenly decided I
had to relieve myself and my nurse picked me up and carried me to the
edge of the platform.  My mother was afraid that the train might
suddenly leave and tried to stop her.  My nurse, who had never seen a
train before and had no concept of a timetable, rounded on her and said
rather grandly: "Can't you tell the driver to wait?  Er-hong has to
have a pee."  She thought everyone would, like her, automatically put
my needs first.

Because of our different status, we had to split up when we got on the
train.  My mother was in a second-class sleeper with my sister, my
grandmother had a soft seat in another carriage, and my nurse and I
were in what was called the 'mothers' and children's compartment,"
where she had a hard seat and I had a cot.  The bodyguard was in a
fourth carriage, with a hard seat.

As the train chugged slowly along my mother gazed out at the rice
paddies and sugarcane.  The occasional peasants walking on the mud
ridges seemed to be half asleep under their broad-brimmed straw hats,
the men naked to the waist.  The network of streams flowed haltingly,
obstructed by tiny mud dams which channeled the water into the numerous
individual rice paddies.

My mother was in a pensive mood.  For the second time within four
years, she and her husband and family were having to decamp from a
place to which they were deeply attached.  First from her hometown,
Jinzhou, and now from my father's, Yibin.  The revolution had not, it
seemed, brought a solution to their problems.  Indeed, it had caused
new ones.  For the first time she vaguely reflected on the fact that,
as the revolution was made by human beings, it was burdened with their
failings.  But it did not occur to her that the revolution was doing
very lit He to deal with these failings, and actually relied on some of
them, often the worst.

As the train approached Chengdu in the early afternoon, she found
herself increasingly looking forward to a new life there.  She had
heard a lot about Chengdu, which had been the capital of an ancient
kingdom and was known as 'the City of Silk' after its most famous
product.  It was also called 'the City of Hibiscus," which was said to
bury the city with its petals after a summer storm.  She was twenty two
At the same age, some twenty years before, her mother had been living
as a virtual prisoner in Manchuria in a house belonging to her absent
warlord 'husband," under the watchful eyes of his servants; she was the
plaything and the property of men.  My mother, at least, was an
independent human being.  Whatever her misery, she was sure it bore no
comparison with the plight of her mother as a woman in old China.  She
told herself she had a lot to thank the Communist revolution for.  As
the train pulled into Chengdu station, she was full of determination to
throw herself into the great cause again.

10.  "Suffering Will Make You a

Better Communist' My Mother Falls under Suspicion

~'1953-195d)

My father met us at the station.  The air was motionless and
oppressive, and my mother and my grandmother were exhausted from the
jolting car journey the night before and the burning heat which had
blown through the train all the way.  We were taken to a guesthouse
belonging to the Sichuan provincial government, which was to be our
temporary lodging.  My mother's transfer had happened so quickly that
she had not been assigned a job, and there had been no time to make
proper arrangements about a place for us to live.

Chengdu was the capital of Sichuan, which was the most populous
province in China, with some sixty-five million people then.  It was a
large city, with a population of over half a million, and had been
founded in the fifth century BC.  Marco Polo visited it in the
thirteenth century and was enormously impressed by its prosperity.  It
was laid out on the same plan as Peking, with ancient palaces and major
gates all on a north-south axis which divided the city neatly

254 "Suffering Will Make You a Better Communist' into two parts,
western and eastern.  By 1953 it had outgrown its original neat plan
and was divided into three administrative districts eastern, western,
and the outskirts.

Within a few weeks of arriving my mother was given a job.  My father
was consulted about it, but, in the good' old tradition of China, not
my mother herself.  My father said anything would do, as long as she
was not working directly under him, so she was made head of the Public
Affairs Department for the Eastern District of the city.  As one's work
unit was responsible for one's accommodations, she was assigned rooms
which belonged to her department, in a traditional courtyard.  We moved
into these rooms, while my father stayed on in his office suite.

Our living quarters were in the same compound as the Eastern District
administration.  Government offices were mostly housed in large
mansions which had been confiscated from Kuomintang officials and
wealthy landlords.  All government employees, even senior officials,
lived at their office.  They were not allowed to cook at home, and all
ate in canteens.  The canteen was also where everyone got their boiled
water, which was fetched in thermos flasks.

Saturday was the only day married couples were allowed to spend
together.  Among officials, the euphemism for making love was 'spending
a Saturday."  Gradually, this regimented life-style relaxed a bit and
married couples were able to spend more time together, but almost all
still lived and spent most of their time in their office compounds.

My mother's depariment ran a very broad field of activities, including
primary education, health, entertainment, and sounding out public
opinion.  At the age of twenty-two, my mother was in charge of all
these activities for about a quarter of a million people.  She was so
busy we hardly ever saw her.  The government wanted to establish a
monopoly (known as 'unified purchasing and marketing') over trade in
the basic commodities grain, cotton, edible o'fi, and meat.  The idea
was to get the peasants to sell these exclusively to the government,
which would then ration them out to the urban population and to parts
of the countrx where they were in short supply.

When the Chinese Communist Party launched a new policy, they
accompanied it with a propaganda drive to help put the new policy
across.  It was part of my mother's job to try to convince people that
the change was for the good.

The core of the message this time was that China had a huge population
and that the problem of feeding and clothing it had never been solved;
now the government wanted to make sure the basic necessities were
fairly distributed and that nobody starved while others hoarded grain
or other essentials.  My mother set about her job with gusto, rushing
around on her bicycle, talking at endless meetings every day, even when
she was in the last months of pregnancy with her fourth child.  She
enjoyed her work, and believed in it.

She only went into the hospital at the last minute to have her next
child, a son, who was born on 15 September 1954.

It was a dangerous delivery again.  The doctor was getting ready to go
home when my mother stopped him.  She was bleeding abnormally, and knew
there was something wrong.  She insisted on the doctor staying and
giving her a checkup.  A fragment of her placenta was missing.  Finding
it was considered a major operation, so the doctor had her placed under
a general anesthetic and searched her womb again.  They found the
fragment, which probably saved her life.

My father was in the countryside trying to galvanize support for the
state monopoly program.  He had just been upgraded to Grade 10 and
promoted to deputy director of the Public Affairs Department for the
whole of Sichuan.

One of its major functions was to keep a running check on public
opinion: How did the people feel about a particular policy?  What
complaints did they have?  Since peasants formed the overwhelming
majority of the population, he was often in the countryside finding out
their views and feelings.  Like my mother, he believed passionately in
his work, which was to keep the Party and the government in touch with
the people.

On the seventh day after my mother gave birth, one of his colleagues
sent a car to the hospital to bring her home.

It was accepted that, if the husband was away, the Party organization
was responsible for taking care of his wife.

My mother gratefully accepted the lift, as 'home' was half an hour's
walk away.  When my father came back a few days later, he reprimanded
his colleague.  The rules stipulated that my mother could ride in an
official car only when my father was in it.  Using a car when he was
not there would be seen as nepotism, he said.  My father's colleague
said he had authorized the car because my mother had just been through
a serious operation which had left her extremely weak.  But a rule is a
rule, replied my father.  My mother found it hard to take this
puritanical rigidity once again.  This was the second time my father
had attacked her immediately after a difficult birth.  Why was he not
there to take her home, she asked, so they would not have to break the
rules?  He had been tied up with his work, he said, which was
important.  My mother understood his dedication she was dedicated
herself.  But she was also bitterly disappointed.

Two days after he was born my new brother, Xiao-bei, developed eczema.
My mother thought this was because she had not eaten any boiled green
olives during the summer, when she was too busy working.  The Chinese
believe that olives get rid of body heat that otherwise comes out in
heat bumps.  For several months Xiao-her's hands had to be tied to the
railings of his cot to prevent him from scratching himself.  When he
was six months old he was sent to a dermatology hospital.  At this
point my grandmother had to rush to Jinzhou as her mother was ill.

Xiao-her's nurse was a country girl from Yibin, with luxuriant long
black hair and flirtatious eyes.  She had accidentally killed her own
baby she had been breast-t~eding it lying down, had fallen asleep, and
had smothered it.  She had gone to see my aunt Jun-ying via a family
connection and begged her to give her a recommendation to my family.

She wanted to go to a big city and have fun.  My aunt gave her a
reference, in spite of the opposition of some local women who said she
only wanted to get to Chengdu to be rid of her husband.  Jun-ying,
though unmarried, was far from being jealous of other people's
pleasure, especially sexual pleasure; in fact, she was always delighted
for them.

She was full of understanding and tolerant of human foibles, and quite
un judgmental

Within a few months the nurse was alleged to be having an affair with
an undertaker in the compound.  My parents considered such things
private matters, and turned a blind eye.

When my brother went into the skin hospital, the wet nurse went with
him.  The Communists had largely eliminated venereal disease, but there
were still some VD patients in one of the wards, and one day the
wet-nurse was spotted in bed with a patient in that ward.  The hospital
told my mother and suggested it would be unsafe for the nurse to
continue breast-feeding Xiao-her.  My mother asked her to leave.  After
that, Xiao-her was cared for by my wet-nurse and the wet-nurse who
looked after my other brother, Jin-ming, who had now joined us from
Yibin.

At the end of 1954 Jin-ming's nurse had written to my mother saying she
would like to come and live with us, as she had been having trouble
with her husband, who had become a heavy drinker and was beating her
up.  My mother had not seen Jin-ming for eighteen months, since he was
a month old.  But his arrival was terribly distressing.

For a long time he would not let her touch him, and the only person he
would call "Mother' was his nurse.

My father also found it difficult to strike up a close relationship
with Jin-ming, but he was very close to me.

He would crawl on the floor and let me ride on his back.

Usually he put some flowers in his collar for me to smell.

If he forgot, I would point at the garden and make commanding noises,
indicating that some should be brought instantly.  He would often kiss
me on the cheek.  Once, when he had not shaved, I wrinkled up my face
and complained, "Old beard, old beard!"  at the top of my voice.  I
called him Old Beard (/ao hu-zO for months.  He kissed me more gingerly
after that.  I loved to toddle in and out of offices and play with the
officials.  I used to chase after them and call them by special names I
invented for them, and recite nursery rhymes to them.  Before I was
three I was known as "Little Diplomat."

I think my popularity was really due to the fact that the officials
welcomed a break and a bit of fun, which I provided with my childish
chattiness.  I was very plump, too, and they all liked sitting me on
their laps and pinching and squeezing me.

When I was a little over three years old my siblings and I were all
sent away to different boarding nurseries.  I could not understand why
I was being taken away from home, and kicked and tore the ribbon in my
hair in protest.  In the nursery I deliberately created trouble for the
teachers and used to pour my milk into my desk every day, following it
with my cod-liver-oil capsules.  We had to take a long siesta after
lunch, during which I would tell frightening stories, which I had made
up, to the other children in the big dormitory.  I was soon found out
and punished by being made to sit on the doorstep.

The reason we were in the nurseries was that there was no one to look
after us.  One day in July 1955, my mother and the 800 employees in the
Eastern District were all told they had to stay on the premises until
further notice.  A new political campaign had started this time to
uncover 'hidden counterrevolution ari  Everyone was to be thoroughly
checked.

My mother and her colleagues accepted the order with out question. They
had been leading a regimented life anyway.  Besides, it seemed natural
for the Party to want to check on its members in order to ensure that
the new society was stable.  Like most of her comrades, my mother's
desire to devote herself to the cause overrode any wish to grumble
about the strictness of the measure.

After a week, almost all her colleagues were cleared and allowed to go
out freely.  My mother was one of the few exceptions.  She was told
that certain things in her past were not yet clarified.  She had to
move out of her own bedroom and sleep in a room in a different part of
the office building.  Before that she was allowed a few days at home to
make arrangements for her family as, she was told, she might be
confined for quite a long time.

The new campaign had been triggered by Mao's reaction to the behavior
of some Communist writers, notably the prominent author Hu Feng.  They
did not necessarily disagree with Mao ideologically, but they betrayed
an element of independence and an ability to think for themselves which
he found unacceptable.  He feared that any independent thinking might
lead to less than total obedience to him.  He insisted that the new
China had to act and think as one, and that stringent measures were
needed to hold the country together, or it might disintegrate.  He had
a number of leading writers arrested and labeled them a
'counterrevolutionary conspiracy," a terrifying accusation, as
'counterrevolutionary' activity carried the harshest punishment,
including the death sentence.

This signaled the beginning of the end of individual expression in
China.  All the media had been taken over by the Party when the
Communists came to power.  From now on it was the minds of the entire
nation that were placed under ever tighter control.

Mao asserted that the people he was looking for were 'spies for the
imperialist countries and the Kuomintang, Trotskyists, ex-Kuomintang
officers, and traitors among the Communists."  He claimed that they
were working for a comeback by the Kuomintang and the "US
imperialists," who were refusing to recognize Peking and were
surrounding China with a ring of hostility.  Whereas the earlier
campaign to suppress counterrevolution ari in which my mother's friend
Hui-ge had been executed, had been directed at actual Kuomintang
people, the targets now were people in the Party, or working in the
government, who had Kuomintang connections in their backgrounds.

Compiling detailed files on people's backgrounds had been a crucial
part of the Communists' system of control even before they came to
power.  The files on Party members were kept by the Organization
Deparunent of the Party.  The dossier on anyone working for the state
who was not a Party member was assembled by the authorities in their
work unit and kept by its personnel management.

Every year a report was written about every employee by their boss, and
this was put into their file.  No one was allowed to read their own
file, and only specially authorized people could read other people's.

To be targeted in this new campaign it was enough to have some sort of
Kuomintang connection in one's past, however tenuous or vague.  The
investigations were carried out by work teams made up of officials who
were known to have no Kuomintang connections.  My mother became a prime
suspect.  Our nurses also became targets because of their family
ties.

There was a work team responsible for investigating the servants and
staff of the provincial government- chauffeurs, gardeners, maids,
cooks, and caretakers.  My nurse's husband was in jail for gambling and
smuggling opium, which made her an 'undesirable."  Jin-ming's nurse had
married into a landlord's family and her husband had been a minor
Kuomintang official.  Because wet-nurses were not in positions of
importance, the Party did not delve into their cases very vigorously.
But they had to stop working for our family.

My mother was informed of this when she was home

My Mother Falls under Suspia'on ztI briefly before her detention.  When
she broke the news to the two nurses, they were distraught.  They loved
Jin-ming and me.  My nurse was also worried about losing her income if
she had to go back to Yibin, so my mother wrote to the governor there
asking him to find her a job, which he did.  She went to work on a tea
plantation and was able to take her young daughter to live with her.

Jin-ming's nurse did not want to go back to her husband.

She had acquired a new boyfriend, a caretaker in Chengdu, and wanted to
marry him.  In floods of tears, she begged my mother to help her get a
divorce so she could marry him.  Divorce was exceedingly difficult, but
she knew that a word from my parents, particularly my father, could
assist greatly.  My mother liked the nurse very much and wanted to help
her.  If she could get a divorce and marry the caretaker she would
automatically move from the 'landlord' category into the working class
and then she would not have to leave my family after all.  My mother
talked to my father, but he was against it: "How can you arrange a
divorce?  People would say the Communists were breaking up families."

"But what about our children?"  my mother said.

"Who will look after them if the nurses both have to go?"  My father
had an answer to that, too: "Send them to nurseries."

When my mother told Jin-ming's nurse that she would have to leave, she
almost collapsed.  Jin-ming's first ever memory is of her departure.
One evening at dusk someone carried him to the front door.  His nurse
was standing there, wearing a countrywoman's outfit, a plain top with
cotton butterfly buttons on the side, and carrying a cotton bundle.

He wanted her to take him in her arms, but she stood just out of reach
as he stretched out his hands toward her.

Tears were streaming down her face.  Then she walked down the steps
toward the gate on the far side of the courtyard.  Someone he did not
know was with her.  She was about to pass through the gate when she
stopped and turned around.  He screamed and bawled and kicked, but he
was not carried any nearer.  She stood for a long time framed in the
arch of the courtyard gate, gazing at him.

Then she turned quickly and disappeared.  Jin-ming never saw her
again.

My grandmother was still in Manchuria.  My great grandmother had just
died of tuberculosis.  Before being 'confined to barracks," my mother
had to pack us four children off to nurseries.  Because it was so
sudden, none of the municipal nurseries could take more than one of us,
so we had to be split up among four different institutions.

As my mother was leaving for detention, my father advised her: "Be
completely honest with the Party, and have complete trust in it.  It
will give you the right verdict."

A wave of aversion swept over her.  She wanted something warmer and
more personal.  Still feeling resentful against my father, she reported
one steamy summer day for her second bout of detention this time under
her own Party.

Being under investigation did not in itself carry the stigma of guilt.
It just meant there were things in one's background which had to be
cleared up.  Still, she was grieved to be subjected to such a
humiliating experience after all her sacrifices and her manifest
loyalty to the Communist cause.  But part of her was full of optimism
that the dark cloud of suspicion which had been hanging over her for
almost seven years would finally be swept away forever.

She had nothing to be ashamed of, nothing to hide.  She was a devoted
Communist and she felt sure the Party would recognize this.

A special team of three people was put together to investigate her. The
head of it was a Mr.  Kuang, who was in charge of Public Affairs for
the city of Chengdu, which meant he was below my father and above my
mother.  His family knew my family well.  Now, though he was still
kindly to my mother, his attitude was more formal and reserved.

Like other detainees, my mother was assigned various women 'companions'
who followed her everywhere, even to the toilet, and slept in the same
bed with her.  She was told that this was for her protection.  She
understood implicitly that she was being 'protected' from committing
suicide, or trying to collude with anyone else.

Several women rotated in shifts as her companion.  One of them was
relieved of her duties because she had to go into detention herself to
be investigated.  Each companion had to file a report on my mother
every day.  They were all people my mother knew because they worked in
the district offices, though not in her department.  They were friendly
and, except for the lack of freedom, my mother was treated well.

The interrogators, plus her companion, conducted the sessions like
friendly conversations, although the subject of these conversations was
extremely unpleasant.  The presumption was not exactly of guilt, but it
was not of innocence, either.  And because there were no proper legal
procedures, there was lit He opportunity to defend oneself against
insinuations.

My mother's file contained detailed reports about every stage of her
life as a student working for the underground, in the Women's
Federation in Jinzhou, and at her jobs in Yibin.  These had been
written by her bosses at the time.  The first issue that came up was
her release from prison under the Kuomintang in 1948.  How had her
family been able to get her out, considering that her offense had been
so serious?  She had not even been tortured!  Could the arrest actually
have been a hoax, designed to establish her credentials with the
Communists so that she could worm her way into a trusted position as an
agent for the Kuomintang?

Then there was her friendship with Hui-ge.  It became obvious that her
bosses in the Women's Federation in Jinzhou had put disparaging
comments into her file about this.  Since Hui-ge had been trying to buy
insurance from the Communists through her, they alleged, was she not
perhaps trying to acquire similar insurance from the Kuomintang in case
it won?

The same question was asked about her Kuomintang suitors.  Did she not
encourage them as insurance for herself?  And then back to the same
grave suspicion: Had any of them instructed her to lie low inside the
Communist Party and work for the Kuomintang?

My mother was put in the impossible position of having to prove her
innocence.  All the people she was being asked about either had been
executed or were in Taiwan, or she did not know where.  In any case,
they were Kuomintang people and their word was not going to be trusted.
How can I convince you?  she sometimes thought with exasperation, as
she went over the same incidents again and again.

She was also asked about her uncles' Kuomintang connections, and about
her relationship with every one of her school friends who, as
teenagers, had joined the Kuomintang's Youth League in the period
before the Communists took Jinzhou.  The guidelines for the campaign
classified anyone who had been appointed a branch chief of the
Kuomintang Youth League after the Japanese surrender as a
'counterrevolutionary."  My mother tried to argue that Manchuria was a
special case: the Kuomintang had been seen as representing China, the
motherland, after the Japanese occupation.  Mao himself had been a
senior official in the Kuomintang once, though she did not mention
this.

Besides, her friends had switched their allegiance to the Communists
within a couple of years.  But she was told that these old friends of
hers were now all designated counterrevolution ari  My mother did not
belong to any condemned category, but she was asked the impossible
question: Why was it that you had so many connections with Kuomintang
people?

She was kept in detention for six months.  During this period she had
to attend several mass rallies at which 'enemy agents' were paraded,
denounced, sentenced, handcuffed, and led away to prison amidst
thunderous shouting of slogans and raising of fists by tens of
thousands of people.  There were also counterrevolution ari who had
'confessed' and therefore been given 'lenient punishment which meant
not being sent to prison.  Among these was a friend of my mother's. 
After the rally she committed suicide because, under interrogation, in
despair, she had made a false confession.  Seven years later the Party
acknowledged that she had been innocent all along.

My mother was taken to these rallies 'to receive a lesson."

But, being a strong character, she was not crushed by fear, like so
many, or confused by the deceptive logic and coaxing of the
interrogations.  She kept a clear head and wrote the story of her life
truthfully.

There were long nights when she lay awake, unable to stifle her
bitterness at her unfair treatment.  As she listened to the whining
mosquitoes outside the net over her bed in the airless heat of the
summer, then the autumn rain pattering on the window, and the damp
silence of winter, she chewed over the unfairness of the suspicions
against her particularly the doubts about her arrest by the Kuomintang.
She was proud of the way she had behaved then, and had never dreamed it
would become the reason for her becoming alienated from the
revolution.

But then she began to persuade herself that she should not resent the
Party for trying to maintain its purity.  In China, one was accustomed
to a certain amount of injustice.  Now, at least, it was for a worthy
cause.  She also repeated to herself the Party's words when it demanded
sacrifice from its members: "You are going through a test, and
suffering will make you a better Communist."

She contemplated the possibility of being classified as a
'counterrevolutionary."  If that happened, her children would also be
contaminated, and our entire lives ruined.

The only way she could avoid this would be to divorce my father and
'disown' herself as our mother.  At night, thinking about these grim
prospects, she learned not to shed tears.  She could not even toss and
turn, as her 'companion' was sleeping in the bed with her, and no
matter how friendly they were, they had to report every scrap of
information about how she behaved.  Tears would be interpreted as
meaning she was feeling wounded by the Party or losing confidence in
it.  Both were unacceptable, and could have a negative effect on the
final verdict.

My mother gritted her teeth and told herself to put her faith in the
Party.  Even so, she found it very hard being totally cut off from her
family, and missed her children terribly.  My father did not write or
visit her once letters and meetings were forbidden.  What she needed
more than anything else at the time was a shoulder on which to rest her
head, or at least a loving word.

But she did get phone calls.  From the other end of the line would come
jokes and words of trust which cheered her up enormously.  The only
phone in the whole department was on the desk of the woman who was in
charge of secret documents.  When a call came for my mother, her
'companions' would stand in the room while she was on the line, but
because they liked her and wanted her to get some comfort, they would
show they were not listening.

The woman in charge of secret documents was not part of the team
investigating my mother, so she was not entitled to listen to or report
on her.  My mother's companions made sure that she never got into
trouble for these phone calls.  They would simply report: "Director
Chang telephoned.  Discussed family matters."  Word went around about
what a considerate husband my father was, so concerned about my mother
and so affectionate.  One of my mother's young companions told her she
wanted to find a husband as nice as my father.

No one knew that the caller was not my father, but another high
official who had come over to the Communists from the Kuomintang during
the war against Japan.

Having once been a Kuomintang officer, he had come under suspicion and
had been imprisoned by the Communists in 1947, although he was
eventually cleared.  He cited his experience to reassure my mother, and
in fact remained a lifelong friend of hers.  My father never phoned
once in the six long months.  He knew from his years of being a
Communist that the Party preferred the person under investigation to
have no contact with the outside world, not even with their spouse.  As
he saw it, to comfort my mother would imply some kind of distrust of
the Party.  My mother could never forgive him for deserting her at a
time when she needed love and support more than anything.  Once again
he had proved that he put the Party first.

One January morning, as she was staring at the clumps of shivering
grass being battered by the dismal rain under the jasmine on the
trellis with its masses of intertwined green shoots, my mother was
summoned to see Mr.  Kuang, the head of the investigating team.  He
told her she was being allowed to go back to work and to go out.  But
she had to report in every night.  The Party had not reached a final
conclusion about her.

What had happened, my mother realized, was that the investigations had
bogged down.  Most of the suspicions could not be either proved or
disproved.  Although this was unsatisfactory for her, she pushed it to
the back of her mind in her excitement at the thought of seeing her
children for the first time in six months.

In our different boarding nurseries, we seldom saw our father, either.
He was constantly away in the countryside.

On the rare occasions when he was back in Chengdu, he would send his
bodyguard to bring my sister and me home on Saturdays.  He never had
the two boys fetched because he felt he could not cope with them, they
were too young.

"Home' was his office.  When we got there he would always have to go
off to some meeting, so his bodyguard would lock us up in the office,
where there was nothing to do, apart from competing at blowing soap
bubbles.  Once I got so bored I drank a lot of soapy water and was ill
for days.

When my mother was told she could go out, the first thing she did was
jump on her bicycle and speed off to our nurseries.  She was
particularly worried about Jin-ming, now two and a half, whom she had
hardly had any time to

268 "SuJ]~ring Will Make You a Better Communist' get to know.  But,
after sitting around unused for six months, her bicycle's tires were
flat, and she was barely out of the gate when she had to stop and get
some air put in them.  She had never felt so impatient in her life, as
she paced around the shop while the man pumped up her tires in what
seemed to her a very lackadaisical manner.

She went to see Jin-ming first.  When she arrived, the teacher looked
at her coldly.  Jin-ming, the teacher said, was one of the very few
children who had been left behind on weekends.  My father had hardly
ever come to see him, and had never taken him home.  At first, Jin-ming
had asked for "Mother Chen," the teacher said.

"That's not you, is it?"  she asked.  My mother acknowledged that
"Mother Chen' was his wet-nurse.  Later, Jin-ming would hide in a
corner room when it was time for the other parents to come and collect
their offspring.

"You must be a stepmother," the teacher said accusingly.  My mother
could not explain.

When Jin-ming was brought in, he remained at the far end of the room
and would not go near my mother.  He just stood there silently,
resentfully refusing to look at her.

My mother produced some peaches and asked him to come over and eat them
while she peeled them.  But Jin-ming would not move.  She had to put
the peaches on her handkerchief and push them along the table.  He
waited for her to withdraw her hand before he grabbed one peach and
devoured it.  Then he took another one.  In no time the three peaches
were gone.  For the first time since she had been taken into detention,
my mother let her tears fall.

I remember the evening she came to see me.  I was nearly four, and was
in my wooden bed which had bars like a cage.  One side of the railing
was let down so she could sit and hold my hand while I fell asleep. But
I wanted to tell her about all my adventures and mischief.  I was
worried that once I fell asleep she would disappear again forever.

Whenever she thought I was asleep and tried to slip her hand away, I
gripped it and started to cry.  She stayed until around midnight.  I
screamed when she started to leave, but she pulled herself away.  I did
not know that 'parole' time was up.

11.  "After the Anti-Rightist Campaign No One Opens Their Mouth' w

China Silenced

(7 956- 7958)

Because we now had no nurses and my mother had to check in for her
'parole' report every evening, we children had to stay on in our
nurseries.  My mother could not have looked after us anyway.  She was
too busy 'racing toward socialism' as a propaganda song went with the
rest of Chinese society.

While she had been in detention Mao had accelerated his attempt to
change the face of China.  In July 1955 he had called for a speeding up
of collective farming, and in November he abruptly announced that all
industry and commerce, which had so far remained in private hands, were
to be nationalized.

My mother was thrown straight into this movement.  In theory, the state
was supposed to own enterprises join fly with the former owners, who
were to draw 5 percent of the value of their business for twenty years.
Since there was officially no inflation, this was supposed to
represent

?

5!

full payment of the total value.  The former owners were to stay on as
managers and be paid a relatively high wage, but there would be a Party
boss over them.

My mother was put in charge of a work team supervising the
nationalization of over a hundred food factories, bakeries, and
restaurants in her district.  Although she was still on 'parole," and
had to report in every evening, and could not even sleep in her own
bed, she was entrusted with this important job.

The Party had attached astigmatic label to her kongzhi shi-yong, which
meant 'employed but under control and surveillance."  This was not made
public, but was known to her and the people in charge of her case.  The
members of her work team knew she had been detained for six months, but
did not know she was still under surveillance.

When my mother was put in detention, she had written to my grandmother
asking her to stay on in Manchuria for the time being.  She had
concocted an excuse, as she did not want my grandmother to know she was
being detained, which would have worried her terribly.

My grandmother was still in Jinzhou when the nationalization program
started, and she found herself caught up in it.  After she had left
Jinzhou with Dr.  Xia in 195I his medicine business had been run by her
brother, Yu-lin.

When Dr.  Xia died in 1952 ownership of the medicine shop passed to
her.  Now the state was planning to buy it out.  In every business a
group, made up of work team members and representatives of both
employees and management, was set up to value its assets so the state
could pay a 'fair price."  They would often suggest a very low figure
to please the authorities.  The value placed on Dr.  Xia's shop was
ridiculously low, but there was an advantage to this for my
grandmother: it meant that she was classified only as a 'minor
capitalist," which made it easier for her to keep a low profile.  She
was not happy about being quasi-expropriated, but she kept her own
counsel.

272 The the Anti-Rightist Campaign..."

As part of the nationalization campaign, the regime organized
processions with drums and gongs and endless meetings, some of them for
the capitalists.  My grandmother saw that all of them were expressing
willingness to be bought out, even gratitude.  Many said that what was
happening to them was much better than they had feared.

In the Soviet Union, they had heard, businesses were confiscated
outright.  Here in China the owners were being indemnified, and what
was more, the state did not just order them to hand over their
businesses.  They had to be willing.  Of course, everyone was.

My grandmother was confused about how she should feel resentful toward
the cause her daughter was engaged in, or happy with her lot, as she
was told she should be.

The medicine business had been built up by Dr.  Xia's hard work, and
her livelihood and that of her daughter had depended on it.  She was
reluctant to see it go just like that.

Four years earlier, during the Korean War, the government had
encouraged people to donate their valuables to help buy fighter planes.
My grandmother did not want to give up her jewelry, which had been
given to her by General Xue and Dr.  Xia, and had at times been her
only source of income.  It also had strong sentimental value.  But my
mother added her voice to that of the government.  She felt that
jewelry was connected with an outdated past, and shared the Party's
view that it was the fruit of 'the exploitation of the people' and
should therefore be returned to them.  She also produced the standard
line about protecting China from being invaded by the "US
imperialists," which did not mean very much to my grandmother.  Her
clinching arguments were: "Mother, what do you still want these things
for?  Nobody wears this sort of thing nowadays.  And you don't have to
rely on them to live.  Now that we have the Communist Party, China is
no longer going to be poor.

What have you got to be worried about?  In any case, you have me.  I
will look after you.  You never have to worry again.  I have to
persuade other people to donate.  It's part jj of my work.  How can I
ask them if my own mother doesn't do it?"  My grandmother gave up.  She
would do anything for her daughter.  She surrendered all her jewelry
except a couple of bracelets, a pair of gold earrings, and a gold ring,
which were wedding presents from Dr.  Xia.  She got a receipt from the
government and much praise for her 'patriotic zeal."

But she was never happy about losing her jewelry, though she hid her
feelings.  Apart from sentimental attachment, there was a very
practical consideration.  My grandmother had lived through constant
insecurity.  Could one really trust the Communist Party to look after
everyone?

Forever?

Now, four years later, she was again in the situation of having to hand
over to the state something she wanted to keep, in fact the last
possession she had.  This time, she did not really have any choice. But
she was also positively cooperative.  She did not want to let her
daughter down, and wanted to make sure her daughter would not be even
slightly embarrassed by her.

The nationalization of the shop was a long process, and my grandmother
stayed on in Manchuria while it dragged on.  My mother did not want her
to come back to Sichuan anyway until she herself had her full freedom
of movement restored and was able to live in her own quarters.  It was
not until summer 1956 that my mother recovered freedom of movement and
the 'parole' restrictions were lifted.  However, even then there was no
definitive decision on her case.

It was finally brought to a conclusion at the end of that year.  The
verdict, which was issued by the Chengdu Party authorities, said in
effect that they believed her account, and that she had no political
connection with the Kuomintang.  This was a clear-cut decision which
exonerated her completely.  She was tremendously relieved, as she knew
her case could well have been left open 'for lack of satisfactory
evidence," like many other similar cases.  Then a stigma

would have stuck with her for life.  Now the chapter was closed, she
thought.  She was very grateful to the chief of the investigation team,
Mr.  Kuang.  Usually officials tended to err on the side of
overzealousness in order to protect themselves.  It needed courage on
the part of Mr.  Kuang to decide to accept what she had said.

After eighteen months of intense anxiety, my mother was in the clear
again.  She was lucky.  As a result of the campaign over I6O'OOO men
and women were labeled counterrevolution ari and their lives were
ruined for three decades.  Among these were some of my mother's friends
in Jinzhou who had been the Kuomintang Youth League cadres.  They were
summarily branded counterrevolution ari sacked from their jobs, and
sent to do manual labor.

This campaign to root out the last vestiges of the Kuomintang past
pushed family background and connections to the forefront.  Throughout
Chinese history, when one person was condemned sometimes the entire
clan men, women, and children, even newborn babies was executed.
Execution could extend to cousins nine times removed (zhu-lian
jill-zu). Someone being accused of a crime could endanger the lives of
a whole neighborhood.

Hitherto the Communists had included people with 'undesirable'
backgrounds in their ranks.  Many sons and daughters of their enemies
rose to high positions.  In fact, most early Communist leaders had come
from 'bad' backgrounds themselves.  But after 1955 family origins
became increasingly important.  As the years went by and Mao launched
one witch-hunt after another, the number of victims snowballed, and
each victim brought down many others, including, first and foremost,
his or her immediate family.

In spite of these personal tragedies, or perhaps partly because of the
steely control, China was more stable in 1956 than at any time this
century.  Foreign occupation, civil war, widespread death from
starvation, bandits,

inflation all seemed to be things of the past.  Stability, the dream of
the Chinese, sustained the faith of people like my mother in their
sufferings.

In the summer of 1956 my grandmother returned to Chengdu.  The first
thing she did was to rush to the nurseries and take us back to my
mother's place.  My grandmother had a fundamental dislike of nurseries.
She said children could not be properly looked after in a group.  My
sister and I looked all right, but as soon as we spotted her, we
screamed and demanded to go home.  The two boys were another matter:
Jin-ming's teacher complained that he was terribly withdrawn, and would
not let any adult touch him.  He only asked, quietly but obstinately,
for his old nurse.  My grandmother burst into tears when she saw
Xiao-her.  He looked like a wooden puppet, with a meaningless grin on
his face.  Wherever he was put, whether sitting or standing, he would
just remain there, motionless.

He did not know how to ask to go to the lavatory, and did not even seem
to be able to cry.  My grandmother swept him up into her arms and he
instantly became her favorite.

Back at my mother's apartment, my grandmother gave vent to her anger
and incomprehension.  In between her tears she called my father and my
mother 'heartless parents."  She did not know that my mother had no
choice.

Because my grandmother could not look after all four of us, the two
older ones, my sister and I, had to go to a nursery during the week.
Every Monday morning, my father and his bodyguard would lift us onto
their shoulders and carry us off howling, kicking, and tearing their
hair.

This went on for some time.  Then, subconsciously, I developed a way of
protesting.  I began to fall ill at the nursery, with high fevers which
alarmed the doctors.  As soon as I was back home, my illness
miraculously evaporated.

Eventually, my sister and I were allowed to stay at home.

For my grandmother, all flowers and trees, the clouds and the rain were
living beings with a heart and tears and a moral sense.  We would be
safe if we followed the old Chinese rule for children, ting-hua
('heeding the words," being obedient).  Otherwise all sorts of things
would happen to us.  When we ate oranges my grandmother would warn us
against swallowing the seeds.

"If you don't listen to me, one day you won't be able to get into the
house.

Every little seed is a baby orange tree, and he wants to grow up, just
like you.  He'll grow quietly inside your turn roy up and up, and then
one day, Ai-ya!  There he is, out from the top of your head!  He'll
grow leaves, and bear more oranges, and he'll become taller than our
door..."

The thought of carrying an orange tree on my head fascinated me so much
that one day I deliberately swallowed a seed one, no more.  I did not
want an orchard on my head: that would be too heavy.  For the whole
day, I anxiously felt my skull every other minute to see whether it was
still in one piece.  Several times I almost asked my grandmother
whether I would be allowed to eat the oranges on my head, but I checked
myself so that she would not know I had been disobedient.  I decided to
pretend it was an accident when she saw the tree.  I slept very badly
that night.  I felt something was pushing up against my skull.

But usually my grandmother's stories sent me happily to sleep.  She had
a wealth of them from classical Chinese opera.  We also had a lot of
books about animals and birds and myths and fairy tales.  We had
foreign children's stories, too, including Hans Christian Andersen and
Aesop's fables.  Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White and the Seven
Dwarfi, and Cinderella were among my childhood companions.

Along with the stories, I loved nursery rhymes.  They were my earliest
encounters with poetry.  Because the Chinese language is based on
tones, its poetry has a particularly musical quality to it.  I was
mesmerized by my grandmother's chanting of classical poems, whose
meaning I did not understand.  She read them in traditional style,
producing singsong, lingering sounds, rising and falling

!(,

in cadence.  One day my mother overheard her reciting to us some poems
written in about 500 BC.  My mother thought they were far too difficult
for us and tried to stop her.  But my grandmother insisted, saying we
did not have to understand the meaning, just get the feel for the
musicality of the sounds.  She often said she regretted losing her
zither when she left Yixian twenty years before.

My two brothers were not so interested in bedtime stories, or in being
read to.  But my sister, who shared a room with me, was just like me:
she loved these stories.

And she had an extraordinary memory.  She had impressed everyone by
reciting Pushkin's long ballad "The Fisherman and the Goldfish'
flawlessly at the age of three.

My family life was tranquil and loving.  Whatever resentment my mother
felt for my father, she seldom had rows with him, at least not in front
of the children.  My father's love for us was rarely shown through
physical contact now that we were older.  It was not customary for a
father to hold his children in his arms, or to show affection by
kissing them or embracing them.  He would often give the boys piggyback
rides, and would pat their shoulders or stroke their hair, which he
rarely did to us girls.  When we got beyond the age of three he would
lift us carefully with his hands under our armpits, strictly adhering
to Chinese convention, which prescribed avoiding intimacy with one's
daughters.  He would not come into the room where my sister and I slept
without our permission.

My mother did not have as much physical contact with us as she would
have liked.  This was because she fell under another set of rules:
those of the Communists' puritanical life-style.  In the early 195os, a
Communist was supposed to give herself so completely to the revolution
and the people that any demonstration of affection for her children was
frowned on as a sign of divided loyalties.  Every single hour apart
from eating or sleeping belonged to the revolution, and was supposed to
be spent working.  Anything that was regarded as not to do with the
revolution, like carrying your children in your arms, had to be
dispatched as speedily as possible.

At first, my mother found this hard to get used to.

"Putting family first' was a criticism constantly leveled at her by her
Party colleagues.  Eventually, she became drilled into the habit of
working nonstop.  By the time she came home in the evening, we had long
since gone to sleep.  She would sit by our bedsides watching our faces
as we slept and listening to our peaceful breathing.  It was the
happiest moment in her day.

Whenever she had time she would cuddle us, gently scratching or
tickling us, especially on our elbows, which was intensely pleasurable.
Pure heaven for me was putting my head on her lap and having the inside
of my ears tickled.

Ear-picking was a traditional form of pleasure for the Chinese.  As a
child, I remember seeing professionals carrying a stand with a bamboo
chair on one end and scores of tiny fluffy picks dangling from the
other.

Starting in 1956 officials started to have Sundays off.

My parents would take us to parks and playgrounds where we played on
the swings and merry-go-rounds or rolled down the grass-covered slopes.
I have a memory of somersaulting dangerously but thrillingly downhill,
meaning to career into my parents' arms, but instead crashing into two
hibiscus trees, one after the other.

My grandmother was still appalled at how often my parents were
absent.

"What sort of parents are these?"  she would sigh, shaking her head. To
make up for them, she gave all her heart and energy to us.  But she
could not cope with four children on her own, so my mother invited Aunt
Jun-ying to come and live with us.  She and my grandmother got on very
well, and this harmony continued when they were joined in early 1957 by
a live-in maid.  This coincided with our move to new quarters, in a
former Christian vicarage.  My father came with us, and so, for the
first time ever, the whole family was living together under one roof.

The maid was eighteen.  When she first arrived she was wearing a
flower-patterned cotton top and slacks, which city dwellers, who wore
quiet colors in keeping with both urban snobbery and Communist
puritanism, would have regarded as rather garish.  City ladies also had
their clothes cut like Russian women's, but our maid wore traditional
peasant-style garb, buttoned at the side, with cotton buttons instead
of the new plastic ones.  Instead of a belt, she used a cotton string
to tie up her trousers.  Many peasant women coming to town would have
changed their attire so as not to look like country bumpkins.  But she
was completely unselfconscious about her clothes, which showed her
strength of character.  She had big, rough hands and a shy, honest
smile on her dark, suntanned face, with two permanent dimples in her
rosy cheeks.  Everyone in our family liked her immediately.  She ate
with us and did the housework with my grandmother and my aunt.  My
grandmother was delighted to have two close friends and confidantes, as
my mother was never there.

Our maid came from a landlord's family, and had been desperate to get
away from the countryside and the constant discrimination she faced
there.  In 1957 it had again become possible to employ people from a
'bad' family background.  The 1955 campaign was over, and the
atmosphere was generally more relaxed.

The Communists had instituted a system under which everyone had to
register their place of residence (hu-kou).

Only those registered as urban dwellers were entitled to food rations.
Our maid had a country registration so she had no source of food when
she was with us, but the rations for my family were more than enough to
feed her too.  One year later, my mother helped her to move her
registration into Chengdu.

My family also paid her wages.  The system of state allowances had been
abolished in late 1956, when my father also lost his bodyguard, who was
replaced by a shared manservant who did chores for him in his office,

like serving him tea and arranging cars.  My parents were now earning
salaries fixed according to their civil service grades.  My mother was
Grade i7, and my father was Grade io, which meant he earned twice as
much as she did.  Because basics were cheap, and there was no concept
of a consumer society, their combined income was more than adequate. My
father was a member of a special category known as gas-gan, 'high
officials," a term applied to people of Grade: 3 and above, of whom
there were about zoo in Sichuan.  There were fewer than twenty people
of Grade xo and above in the whole province, which had a population of
about seventy-two million now.

In the spring of 1956 Mao announced a policy known as the Hundred
Flowers, from the phrase 'let a hundred flowers bloom' (bai-hua
qi-j~ng), which in theory meant greater freedom for the arts,
literature, and scientific research.  The Party wanted to enlist the
support of China's educated citizens, which the country needed, as it
was entering a stage of 'post-recovery' industrialization.

The general educational level of the country had always been very low.
The population was huge over 600 million by then and the vast majority
had never enjoyed anything like a decent standard of living.  The
country had always had a dictatorship which operated by keeping the
public ignorant and thus obedient.  There was also the problem of the
language: the Chinese script is exceedingly difficult;

it is based on tens of thousands of individual characters which are not
related to sounds, and each has complicated strokes and needs to be
remembered separately.  Hundreds of millions of people were completely
illiterate.

Anybody with any education at all was referred to as an 'intellectual."
Under the Communists, who based their policies on class categories,
'intellectuals' became a specific, if vague, category, which included
nurses, students, and actors as well as engineers, technicians,
writers, teachers, doctors, and scientists.

Under the Hundred Flowers policy, the country enjoyed

China Silenced 28 i about a year of relative relaxation.  Then, in
spring 1957, the Party urged intellectuals to criticize officials all
the way to the top.  My mother thought this was to encourage further
liberalization.  After a speech by Mao on the subject, which was
gradually relayed down to her level, she was so moved she could not
sleep all night.  She felt that China was really going to have a modern
and democratic party, a party that would welcome criticism to
revitalize itself.  She felt proud of being a Communist.

When my mother's level was told about Mao's speech soliciting criticism
of officers, they were not informed about some other remarks he had
made around the same time, about enticing snakes out of their lairs to
uncover anyone who dared to oppose him or his regime.  One year before,
the Soviet leader, Khrushchev, had denounced Stalin in his 'secret
speech," and this had devastated Mao, who identified himself with
Stalin.  Mao was further rat fled by the Hungarian uprising that
autumn, the first successful if short-lived attempt to overthrow an
established Communist regime.  Mao knew that a large proportion of
China's educated people favored moderation and liberalization.  He
wanted to prevent a "Chinese Hungarian uprising."  In fact, he
effectively told the Hungarian leaders that his solicitation of
criticism had been a trap, which he had prolonged after his colleagues
suggested bringing it to a halt, in order to make sure he had smoked
out every single potential dissident.

He was not worried about the workers or the peasants, as he was
confident they were grateful to the Communists for bringing them full
stomachs and stable lives.  He also had a fundamental contempt for them
he did not believe they had the mental capacity to challenge his rule.
But Mao had always distrusted intellectuals.  They had played a big
role in Hungary, and were more likely than others to think for
themselves.

Unaware of Mao's secret maneuvers, officials and intellectuals alike
engaged in soliciting and offering criticisms.

282 5qfier the Anti-Rightist Campaign..."

According to Mao, they were to 'say whatever they want to say, and to
the full."  My mother enthusiastically repeated this in the schools,
hospitals, and entertainment groups she looked after.  All kinds of
opinions were aired at organized seminars and on wall posters.
Well-known people set an example by making criticisms in the
newspapers.

My mother, like almost everyone, came in for some criticism.  The main
one from the schools was that she showed favoritism toward 'key'
(zhong-dian) schools.  In China there were a number of officially
designated schools and universities on which the state concentrated its
limited resources.  These got better teachers and facilities, and
selected the brightest pupils, which guaranteed that they had a high
entrance rate into institutions of higher education, especially the
'key' universities.  Some teachers from ordinary schools complained
that my mother had been paying too much attention to the 'key' schools
at their expense.

Teachers were also graded.  Good teachers were given honorary grades
which entitled them to much higher salaries, special food supplies when
there was a shortage, better housing, and complimentary theater
tickets.  Most graded teachers under my mother seemed to have come from
'undesirable' family backgrounds, and some of the ungraded teachers
complained that my mother placed too much importance on professional
merit rather than 'class background."  My mother made self-criticisms
about her lack of even handedness regarding the 'key' schools, but she
insisted that she was not wrong in using professional merit as the
criterion for promotion.

There was one criticism to which my mother turned a deaf ear in
disgust.  The headmistress of one primary school had joined the
Communists in 1945 earlier than my mother and was unhappy at having to
take orders from her.  This woman attacked my mother on the grounds
that she had got her job solely on the strength of my father's
statuS.

There were other complaints: the headmasters wanted the right to choose
their own teachers, instead of having them assigned by a higher
authority.  Hospital directors wanted to be able to buy herbs and other
medicines themselves, because the state supply did not meet their
needs.

Surgeons wanted larger food rations: they considered their job to be as
demanding as that of a kung-fu player in a traditional opera, but their
ration was a quarter less.  A junior official lamented the
disappearance from Chengdu markets of some famous traditional items
like "Pockmark Wong scissors' and "Beards Hu brushes," which had been
replaced by inferior mass-produced substitutes.  My mother agreed with
many of these views, but there was nothing she could do about them, as
they involved state policies.  All she could do was report them to
higher authorities.

The outburst of criticisms, which were often personal grouses or
practical, nonpolitical suggestions for improvements, blossomed for
about a month in the early summer of 1957.  At the beginning of June,
Mao's speech about 'enticing snakes out of their lairs' was relayed
down orally to my mother's level.

In this talk, Mao said that 'rightists' had gone on a rampage attacking
the Communist Party and China's socialist system.  He said these
rightists made up between 1 percent and 10 percent of all
intellectuals and that they must be smashed.  To simplify things, a
figure of 5 percent, halfway between Mao's two extremes, had been
established as the quota for the number of rightists who had to be
caught.  To meet it, my mother was expected to find over a hundred
rightists in the organizations under her.

She had not been very happy about some of the criticisms made to her.
But few of them could even remotely be considered 'anti-Communist' or
'anti-socialist."  Judging from what she had read in the newspapers, it
seemed there had been some attacks on the Communists' monopoly of power
and on the socialist system.  But in her schools and a84 ~lfier the
Anti-Rightist Campaign..."

hospitals, there were no such grand calls.  Where on earth could she
find the rightsts?

Besides, she thought, it was unfair to penalize people who had spoken
up after they had been invited, indeed urged, to do so.  Moreover, Mao
had explicitly guaranteed that there would be no reprisals for speaking
up.  She herself had called enthusiastically on people to voice their
criticisms.

Her dilemma was typical of that facing millions of officials across
China.  In Chengdu, the Anti-Rightist Campaign had a slow and painful
start.  The provincial authorities decided to make an example of one
man, a Mr.  Hau, who was the Party secretary of a research institute
staffed by top scientists from all over Sichuan.  He was expected to
catch a considerable number of rightists, but he reported that there
was not a single one in his institute.

"How is that possible?"  his boss said.  Some of the scientists had
studied abroad, in the West.

"They must have been contaminated by Western society.  How can you
expect them to be happy under communism?  How can there be no rightists
among them?"  Mr.  Hau said that the fact that they were in China by
choice proved they were not opposed to the Communists, and went so far
as to give a personal guarantee for them.  He was warned several times
to mend his ways.  In the end he was declared a rightist himself,
expelled from the Party, and sacked from his job.  His civil service
grade was drastically reduced, which meant his salary was slashed, and
he was put to work sweeping the floors of the laboratories in the
institute he had formerly been running.

My mother knew Mr.  Hau, and admired him for sticking to his guns.  She
developed a great friendship with him which has lasted till today.  She
spent many evenings with him, giving vent to her anxieties.  But in his
fate she saw her own if she did not fill her quota.

Every day, after the usual endless meetings, my mother had to report to
the municipal Party authorities on how the campaign was going.  The
person in charge of the campaign i,

China Silenced z85 in Chengdu was a Mr.  Ying, a lean, tall, rather
arrogant man.  My mother was supposed to produce figures for him
showing how many rightists had been nailed.  There did not have to be
any names.  It was numbers that mattered.

But where could she find her ioo-plus 'antiCommunist, anti-socialist
rightists'?  Eventually one of her deputies, a Mr.  Kong, who was in
charge of education for the Eastern District, announced that the
headmistresses of a couple of schools had identified some teachers in
their schools.  One was a teacher in a primary school whose husband, a
Kuomintang officer, had been killed in the civil war.  She had said
something to the effect that "China today is worse off than in the
past."  One day she got into a row with the headmistress, who had
criticized her for slacking off.  She flew into a rage and hit the
headmistress.  A couple of her teachers tried to stop her, one telling
her to be careful because the headmistress was pregnant.  She was
reported to have screamed that she wanted to 'get rid of that Communist
bastard' (meaning the baby in the woman's womb).

In another case, a teacher whose husband had fled to Taiwan with the
Kuomintang was reported to have shown off to other young women teachers
some jewelry her husband had given her, trying to make them envious of
her life under the Kuomintang.  These young women also said she told
them it was a pity the Americans had not won the war in Korea and
advanced into China.

Mr.  Kong said he had checked the facts.  It was not up to my mother to
investigate.  Caution would be seen as trying to protect the rightists
and questioning her colleagues' integrity.

The hospital chiefs and the deputy who was running the health bureau
did not name any rightists themselves, but several doctors were labeled
rightists by the higher authorities of the Chengdu municipality for
their criticisms made at earlier meetings organized by the city
authorities.

All these rightists together came to fewer than ten, far short of the
quota.  By now Mr.  Ying was fed up with the lack of zeal displayed by
my mother and her colleagues, and he told her that the fact that she
could not spot rightism showed she was 'rightist material' herself.  To
be labeled a rightist not only meant becoming a political outcast and
losing one's job, but, most important, one's children and family would
suffer discrimination and their future would be in jeopardy.  The
children would be ostracized at school and in the street where they
lived.  The residents' committee would spy on the family to see who was
visiting them.

If a rightist was sent to the countryside, the peasants would give the
hardest jobs to him and his family.  But no one knew the exact impact,
and this uncertainty was itself a powerful cause of fear.

This was the dilemma facing my mother.  If she was labeled a rightist,
she would either have to renounce her children or ruin their future. My
father would probably be forced to divorce her, or he too would be
blacklisted and under permanent suspicion.  Even if my mother
sacrificed herself and divorced him, the whole family would still be
marked as suspects, forever.  But the cost of saving herself and her
family was the well-being of more than a hundred innocent people and
their families.

My mother did not talk to my father about this.  What solution could he
have come up with?  She felt resentful because his high position meant
he did not have to deal with specific cases.  It was the lower- and
middle-rank officials like Mr.  Ying, my mother, her deputies, the
headmistresses, and hospital directors who had to make these agonizing
decisions.

One of the institutions in my mother's district was the Chengdu Number
Two Teacher Training College.  Students in teacher training colleges
were given scholarships which covered their fees and living expenses,
and these institutions naturally attracted people from poor families.

The first railway linking Sichuan, "Heaven's Granary," with the rest of
China had recently been completed.  As a result,

?

a lot of food was suddenly transported out of Sichuan to other parts of
China, and the prices of many items doubled or even tripled almost
overnight.  The students at the college found their standard of living
practically halved, and staged a demonstration calling for higher
grants.  This action was compared by Mr.  Ying to those of the Pettfi
Circle in the 1956 Hungarian uprising, and he called the students
'kindred spirits of the Hungarian intellectuals."

He ordered that every student who had participated in the demonstration
should be classified as a rightist.  There were about 300 students at
the college, of whom ~ 30 had taken part in the demonstration.  All of
them were labeled rightists by Mr.  Ying.  Although the college was not
under my mother, as she looked after primary schools only, it was
located in her district, and the city authorities arbitrarily counted
the students as her quota.

My mother was not forgiven for her lack of initiative.

Mr.  Ying put her name down for further investigation as a rightist
suspect.  But before he could do anything, he was condemned as a
rightist himself.

In March 1957 he had gone to Peking for a conference of the heads of
provincial and municipal Public Affairs departments from the whole of
China.  In the group discussions, delegates were encouraged to voice
their complaints about the way things were run in their areas.  Mr.
Ying aired some fairly innocuous grumbles against the first secretary
of the Sichuan Party Committee, Li Jing-quan, who was always known as
Commissar Li.  My father was the head of the Sichuan delegation at the
conference, so it fell to him to write the routine report when they
came back.  When the Anti-Rightist Campaign started, Commissar Li
decided he did not like what Mr.  Ying had said.  He checked with the
deputy head of the delegation, but this man had adroitly absented
himself in the toilet when Mr.  Ying started his criticism.  In the
later stage of the campaign, Commissar Li labeled Mr.  Ying a rightist.
When he heard this, my father became desperately upset, tormenting
himself with the thought that he was partly responsible for Mr.  Ying's
downfall.  My mother tried to convince him this was not the case: "It's
not your fault!"  she told him.  But he never stopped agonizing about
it.

Many officials used the campaign to settle personal scores.  Some found
that one easy way to fill their quota was to offer up their enemies.
Others acted out of sheer vindictiveness.  In Yibin, the Tings purged
many talented people with whom they did not get on, or of whom they
were jealous.  Almost all of my father's assistants there, whom he had
picked out and promoted, were condemned as rightists.  One former
assistant whom my father liked very much was branded an 'extreme
rightist."  His crime was a single remark to the effect that China's
reliance on the Soviet Union should not be 'absolute."  At the time the
Party was proclaiming that it should be.  He was sentenced to three
years in one of China's gnlags and worked on building a road in a wild,
mountainous area, where many of his fellow prisoners died.

The Anti-Rightist Campaign did not affect society at large.  Peasants
and workers carried on with their lives.

When the campaign ended after a year, at least 55o,000 people had been
labeled as rightists students, teachers, writers, artists, scientists,
and other professionals.  Most of them were sacked from their jobs and
became manual laborers in factories or on farms.  Some were sent to do
hard labor in gnlags.  They and their families became second-class
citizens.  The lesson was harsh and clear:

criticism of any kind was not going to be tolerated.  From that point
on people stopped complaining, or speaking up at all.  A popular saying
summed up the atmosphere: "After the Three Antis no one wants to be in
charge of money;

after the Anti-Rightist Campaign no one opens their mouth."

But the tragedy of 1957 was more than that of reducing people to
silence.  The possibility of falling into the abyss now became
unpredictable.  The quota system combined with personal vendettas meant
that anyone could be persecuted, for nothing.

The vernacular caught the mood.  Among the categories ofrighfists were
'lots-drawing rightists' (chou-qianyou-pal), people who drew lots to
decide who should be named as rightists, and 'toilet rightists' (ce-suo
you-pat), people who found they had been nominated in their absence
after they could not restrain themselves from going to the toilet
during the many long, drawn-out meetings.  There were also rightists
who were said to 'have poison but not released it'

Oeou-du Im-J~ng); these were people who were named as rightists without
having said anything against anyone.

When a boss did not like someone, he could say: "He doesn't look
right," or "His father was executed by the

Communists, how can he not feel resentful?  He just won't say it
openly."  A kindhearted unit leader sometimes did the opposite: "Whom
should I nail?  I can't do that to anyone.

Say it's me."  He was popularly called a 'self-acknowledged rightist'
(zi-ren you-pal).

For many people 1957 was a watershed.  My mother was still devoted to
the Communist cause, but doubts crept in about its practice.  She
talked about these doubts with her friend Mr.  Hau, the purged director
of the research institute, but she never revealed them to my father not
because he had no doubts, but because he would not discuss them with
her.  Party rules, like military orders, forbade members from talking
about Party policies among themselves.  It was stipulated in the Party
charter that every member must unconditionally obey his Party
organization, that a lower-rank official must obey a higher-rank one.
If you had any disagreement, you could mention it only to a higher-rank
official, who was deemed to be an inca marion of the Party
organization. This regimental discipline, which the Communists had
insisted on since the Yan'an days and earlier, was crucial to their
success.  It was a formidable instrument of power, as it needed to be
in a society where personal relationships overrode any other rules.  My
father

19o ~tfler the Anti-Rightist Campaign..."

adhered to this discipline totally.  He believed that the revolution
could not be preserved and sustained if it were challenged openly.  In
a revolution you had to fight for your side even if it was not perfect
as long as you believed it was better than the other side.  Unity was
the categorical imperative.

My mother could see that as far as my father's relationship with the
Party was concerned, she was an outsider.

One day, when she ventured some critical comments about the situation
and got no response from him, she said bitterly, "You are a good
Communist, but a rotten husband!"

My father nodded.  He said he knew.

Fourteen years later, my father told us children what had almost
happened to him in 1957.  Since his early days in Yan'an, when he was a
young man of twenty, he had been close friends with a well-known woman
writer called Ding Ling.  In March 1957, when he was in Peking leading
the Sichuan delegation at a Public Affairs conference, she sent him a
message inviting him to visit her in Tianjin, near Peking.  My father
wanted to go, but decided against it because he was in a hurry to get
home.  Several months later Ding Ling was labeled as the number-one
rightist in China.

"If I had gone to see her," my father told us, "I would have been done
for too."

12.  "Capable Women Can Make a Meal without Food' Famine

(1958-19dr)

In the autumn of 1958, when I was six, I started going to a primary
school about twenty minutes' walk from home, mostly along muddy cobbled
back alleys.  Every day on my way to and from school, I screwed up my
eyes to search every inch of ground for broken nails, rusty cogs, and
any other metal objects that had been trodden into the mud between the
cobbles.  These were for feeding into furnaces to produce steel, which
was my major occupation.  Yes, at the age of six, I was involved in
steel production, and had to compete with my schoolmates at handing in
the most scrap iron.  All around me uplifting music blared from
loudspeakers, and there were banners, posters, and huge slogans painted
on the walls proclaiming "Long Live the Great Leap Forward!"  and
"Everybody, Make Steel{' Although I did not fully understand why, I
knew that Chairman Mao had ordered the nation to make a lot of steel.
In my school, crucible-like vats had replaced some of our cooking woks
and were sitting on the giant stoves in the kitchen.

All our scrap iron was fed into them, including the old

292 "Capable Women Can Make a Meal without Food' woks, which had now
been broken to bits.  The stoves were kept permanently lit until they
melted down.  Our teachers took turns feeding firewood into them around
the-clock, and stirring the scraps in the vats with a huge spoon. We
did not have many lessons, as the teachers were too preoccupied with
the vats.  So were the older, teenage children.  The rest of us were
organized to clean the teachers' apa~iments and babysit for them.

I remember visiting a hospital once with some other children to see one
of our teachers who had been seriously burned when molten iron had
splashed onto her arms.  Doctors and nurses in white coats were rushing
around frantically.  There was a furnace on the hospital grounds, and
they had to feed logs into it all the time, even when they were
performing operations, and right through the night.

Shortly before I started going to school, my family had moved from the
old vicarage into a special compound, which was the center of
government for the province.  It enclosed several streets, with blocks
of apatiments and offices and a number of mansions; a high wall blocked
it off from the outside world.  Inside the main gate was what had been
the US Servicemen's Club during the Second World War.  Ernest Hemingway
had stayed there in 194x.

The club building was in traditional Chinese style, with the ends of
its yellow filed roof turning upward, and heavy dark red pillars.  It
was now the office of the secretariat of the Sichuan government.

A huge furnace was erected in the parking lot where the chauffeurs used
to wait.  At night the sky was lit up, and the noise of the crowds
around the furnace could be heard 3o0 yards away in my room.  My
family's woks went into this furnace, together with all our cast-iron
cooking utensils.  We did not suffer from their loss, as we did not
need them anymore.  No private cooking was allowed now, and everybody
had to eat in the canteen.  The furnaces were insatiable.  Gone was my
parents' bed, a so~~, comfortable one with iron springs.  Gone also
were the iron railings from the city pavements, and anything else that
was iron.

I hardly saw my parents for months.  They often did not come home at
all, as they had to make sure the temperature in their office furnaces
never dropped.

It was at this time that Mao gave full vent to his halfbaked dream of
turning China into a first-class modern power.  He called steel the
"Marshal' of industry, and ordered steel output to be doubled in one
year from 5.35 million tons in 1957 to zo.7 million in 1958.  But
instead of trying to expand the proper steel industry with skilled
workers, he decided to get the whole population to take part.  There
was a steel quota for every unit, and for months people stopped their
normal work in order to meet it.  The country's economic development
was reduced to the simplistic question of how many tons of steel could
be produced, and the entire nation was thrown into this single act.  It
was officially estimated that nearly zoo million peasants were pulled
out of agricultural work and into steel production.  They had been the
labor force producing much of the country's food.  Mountains were
stripped bare of trees for fuel.  But the output of this mass
production amounted only to what people called 'caMe droppings'
(nill-shi-ge-day meaning useless turds.

This absurd situation reflected not only Mao's ignorance of how an
economy worked, but also an almost metaphysical disregard for reality,
which might have been interesting in a poet, but in a political leader
with absolute power was quite another matter.  One of its main
components was a deep-seated contempt for human life.  Not long before
this he had told the Finnish ambassador, "Even if the United States had
more powerful atom bombs and used them on China, blasted a hole in the
earth, or blew it to pieces, while this might be a matter of great
significance to the solar system, it would still be an insignificant
matter as far as the universe as a whole is concerned."

Mao's voluntarism had been fueled by his recent experience in Russia.
Increasingly disillusioned with Khrushchev after his denunciation of
Stalin in 1956, Mao went to Moscow in late 1957 to attend a world
Communist summit.

He returned convinced that Russia and its allies were abandoning
socialism and turning 'revisionist."  He saw China as the only true
believer.  It had to blaze a new path.

Megalomania and voluntarism meshed easily in Mao's mind.

Mao's fixation on steel went largely unquestioned, as did his other
obsessions.  He took a dislike to sparrows they devour grain.  So every
household was mobilized.  We sat outside ferociously beating any metal
object, from cymbals to saucepans, to scare the sparrows off the trees
so they would eventually drop dead from exhaustion.  Even today I can
vividly hear the din made by my siblings and me, as well as by the
government officials, sitting under a mammoth wolfoerry tree in our
courtyard.

There were also fantastic economic goals.  Mao claimed that China's
industrial output could overtake that of the United States and Britain
within fifteen years.  For the Chinese, these countries represented the
capitalist world.

Overtaking them would be seen as a triumph over their enemies.  This
appealed to people's pride, and boosted their enthusiasm enormously.
They had felt humiliated by the refusal of the United States and most
major Western countries to grant diplomatic recognition, and were so
keen to show the world that they could make it on their own that they
wanted to believe in miracles.  Mao provided the inspiration.  The
energy of the population had been eager to find an outlet.  And here it
was.  The gung-ho spirit overrode caution, as ignorance triumphed over
reason.

In early 1958, shortly after returning from Moscow, Mao visited
Chengdu for about a month.  He was fired up with the idea that China
could do anything, especially seize the leadership of socialism from
the Russians.  It was in

Chengdu that he outlined his "Great Leap Forward."  The city organized
a big parade for him, but the participants had no idea that Mao was
there.  He lurked out of sight.

At this parade a slogan was put forward, "Capable women can make a meal
without food," a reversal of a pragmatic ancient Chinese saying, "No
matter how capable, a woman cannot make a meal without food."
Exaggerated rhetoric had become concrete demands.  Impossible fantasies
were supposed to become reality.

It was a gorgeous spring that year.  One day Mao went for an outing to
a park called the Thatched Cottage of Du Fu, the eighth century Tang
poet.  My mother's Eastern District office was responsible for the
security of one area of the park, and she and her colleagues patrolled
it, pretending to be tourists.  Mao rarely kept to a schedule, or let
people know his precise movements, so for hours and hours my mother sat
sipping tea in the teahouse, trying to keep on the alert.  She finally
grew restless and told her colleagues she was going for a walk.  She
strayed into the security area of the Western District, whose staff did
not know her, and was immediately followed.  When the Party secretary
of the Western District received reports about a 'suspicious woman' and
came to see for himself, he laughed: "Why, this is old Comrade Xia from
the Eastern District!"  Afterward my mother was criticized by her boss,
district chief Guo, for 'running around without discipline."

Mao also visited a number of farms in the Chengdu Plain.  Thus far,
peasant cooperatives had been small.  It was here that Mao ordered them
all to be merged into bigger institutions, which were later called
'people's communes."

That summer, all of China was organized into these new units, each
containing between 2,000 and 20,000 households.  One of the forerunners
of this drive was an area called Xushui, in Hebei province in North
China, to which Mao took a shine.  In his eagerness to prove that they
deserved Mao's attention, the local boss there claimed they were going
to produce over ten times as much grain as before.  Mao smiled broadly
and responded: "What are you going to do with all that food?  On second
thought, it's not too bad to have too much food, really.  The state
doesn't want it.  Everybody else has plenty of their own.  But the
farmers here can just eat and eat.  You can eat five meals a day!"  Mao
was intoxicated, indulging in the eternal dream of the Chinese peasant-
surplus food.  After these remarks, the villagers further stoked the
desires of their Great Leader by claiming that they were producing more
than a million pounds of potatoes per mu (one mu is one-sixth of an
acre), over 130,000 pounds of wheat per mu, and cabbages weighing 500
pounds each.

It was a time when telling fantasies to oneself as well as others, and
believing them, was practised to an incredible degree.  Peasants moved
crops from several plots of land to one plot to show Party officials
that they had produced a miracle harvest.  Similar "Potemkin fields'
were shown off to gullible or self-blinded agricultural scientists,
reporters, visitors from other regions, and foreigners.

Although these crops generally died within a few days because of
untimely transplantation and harmful density, the visitors did not know
that, or did not want to know.  A large part of the population was
swept into this confused, crazy world.

"Self-deception while deceiving others' (~ioqiqi-ren) gripped the
nation.  Many people including agricultural scientists and senior Party
leaders Said they saw the miracles themselves.  Those who failed to
match other people's fantastic claims began to doubt and blame
themselves.  Under a dictatorship like Mao's, where information was
withheld and fabricated, it was very difficult for ordinary people to
have confidence in their own experience or knowledge.  Not to mention
that they were now facing a nationwide tidal wave of fervor which
promised to swamp any individual cool headedness  It was easy to start
ignoring reality and simply put one's faith in Mao.  To go along with
the frenzy was by far the easiest course.  To pause and think and be
circumspect meant trouble.

An official cartoon portrayed a mouselike scientist wh~=

ingA stove like yours can only boil water to make tea."

Next to him stood a giant worker, lifting a huge sluice gate releasing
a flood of molten steel, who retorted, "How much can you drink?"  Most
who saw the absurdity of the situation were too frightened to speak
their minds, particularly after the Anti-Rightist Campaign of 1957.
Those who did voice doubts were immediately silenced, or sacked, which
also meant discrimination against their family and a bleak prospect for
their children.

In many places, people who refused to boast of massive increases in
output were beaten up until they gave in.  In Yibin, some leaders of
production units were trussed up with their arms behind their backs in
the village square while questions were hurled at them:

"How much wheat can you produce per mu?"

"Four hundred fin' (about 450 pounds a realistic amount).

Then, beating him: "How much wheat can you produce per mu?"

"Eight hundred fin."

Even this impossible figure was not enough.  The unfortunate man would
be beaten, or simply left hanging, until he finally said: "Ten thousand
fin."  Sometimes the man died hanging there because he refused to
increase the figure, or simply before he could raise the figure high
enough.

Many grass-roots officials and peasants involved in scenes like this
did not believe in the ridiculous boasting, but fear of being accused
themselves drove them on.  They were carrying out the orders of the
Party, and they were safe as long as they followed Mao.  The
totalitarian system in which they had been immersed had sapped and
warped their sense of responsibility.  Even doctors would boast about
miraculously healing incurable diseases.

Trucks used to turn up at our compound carrying grinning peasants
coming to report on some fantastic, recordbreaking achievement.  One
day it was a monster cucumber half as long as the truck.  Another time
it was a tomato carded with difficulty by two children.  On another
occasion there was a giant pig squeezed into a truck.  The peasants
claimed they had bred an actual pig this size.  The pig was only made
of papier-m~eh~, but as a child I imagined that it was real.  Maybe I
was confused by the adults around me, who behaved as though all this
were true.  People had learned to defy reason and to live with
acting.

The whole nation slid into doublespeak.  Words became divorced from
reality, responsibility, and people's real thoughts.  Lies were told
with ease because words had lost their meanings and had ceased to be
taken seriously by others.

This was entrenched by the further regimentation of society.  When he
first set up the communes, Mao said their main advantage was that 'they
are easy to control," because the peasants would now be in an organized
system rather than being, to a certain extent, left alone.  They were
given detailed orders from the very top about how to fill their land.
Mao summed up the whole of agriculture in eight characters: 'soil,
fertilizer, water, seeds, dense planting, protection, tending,
technology."  The Party Central Committee in Peking was handing out
two-page instructions on how peasants all over China should improve
their fields, another page on how to use fertilizers, another on
planting crops densely.  Their incredibly simplistic instructions had
to be strictly followed: the peasants were ordered to replant their
crops more densely in one mini-campaign after another.

Another means of regimentation, setting up canteens in the communes,
was an obsession with Mao at the time.  In his airy way, he defined
communism as 'public canteens with free meals."  The fact that the
canteens themselves did not produce food did not concern him.  In 1958
the regime effectively banned eating at home.  Every peasant had to eat
in the commune canteen.  Kitchen utensils like woks and, in some
places, money were outlawed.  Everybody was going to be looked after by
the commune and the state.

The peasants filed into the canteens every day after work and ate to
their hearts' content, which they had never been able to do before,
even in the best years and in the most fertile areas.  They consumed
and wasted the entire lbod reserve in the countryside.  They filed into
the fields, too.

But how much work was done did not matter, because the produce now
belonged to the state, and was completely unrelated to the peasants'
lives.  Mao put forward the prediction that China was reaching a
society of communism, which in Chinese means 'sharing material goods,"
and the peasants took this to mean that they would get a share anyway,
regardless of how much work they did.  With no incentive to work, they
just went to the fields and had a good snooze.

Agriculture was also neglected because of the priority given to steel.
Many of the peasants were exhausted from having to spend long hours
finding fuel, scrap iron, and iron ore and keeping the furnaces going.
The fields were often left to the women and children, who had to do
everything by hand, as the animals were busy making their contribution
to steel production.  When harvest time came in autumn 1958, few people
were in the fields.

The failure to get in the harvest in 1958 flashed a warning that a food
shortage was on its way, even though official statistics showed a
double-digit increase in agricultural output.  It was officially
announced that in 1958 China's wheat output had overtaken that of the
United States.  The Party newspaper, the People's Daily, started a
discussion on the topic "How do we cope with the problem of producing
too much food?"

My father's depa~Unent was in charge of the press in Sichuan, which
printed outlandish claims, as did every publication in China.  The
press was the voice of the Party, and when it came to Party policies,
neither my father nor anyone else in the media had any say.  They were
part of a huge conveyor belt.  My father watched the turn of events
with alarm.  His only option was to appeal to the top leaders.

At the end of 1958 he wrote a letter to the Central Committee in Peking
stating that producing steel like this was pointless and a waste of
resources; the peasants were exhausted, their labor was being
squandered, and there was a food shortage.  He appealed for urgent
action.

He gave the letter to the governor to pass on.  The governor, Lee
Da-zhang, was the number-two man in the province.  He had given my
father his first job when he had come to Chengdu from Yibin, and
treated him like a friend.

Governor Lee told my father he was not going to forward the letter.
Nothing in it was new, he said.

"The Party knows everything.  Have faith in it."  Mao had said that
under no circumstances must the people's morale be dampened.

The Great Leap Forward had changed the psychological attitude of the
Chinese from passivity to a can-do, get-up and-go spirit, he said,
which must not be imperiled.

Governor Lee also told my father that he had been given the dangerous
nickname "Opposition' among the provincial leaders, to whom he had
voiced disagreements.  It was only because of his other qualities, his
absolute loyalty to the

Party and his stern sense of discipline, that my father was still all
right.

"The good thing," the governor said, 'is that you only voiced your
doubts to the Party, and not to the public."  He warned my father he
could get into serious trouble if he insisted on raising these
concerns, as could his family and 'others," clearly meaning himself, my
father's friend.  My father did not insist.  He was half convinced by
the argument, and the stakes were too high.  He had reached a stage
where he was not insusceptible to compromise.

But my father and the people working in the departments of Public
Affairs collected a great number of complaints, as part of their jobs,
and forwarded them to Peking.

There was general discontent among the people and officials alike.  In
fact, the Great Leap Forward triggered off the most serious split in
the leadership since the Communists had taken power a decade before. 
Mao had to step down from the less important of his two main posts,
president of the state, in favor of Liu Shaoqi.  Liu became the
number-two man in China, but his prestige was only a fraction of that
of Mao, who kept his key post as chairman of the Party.

The voices of dissent grew so strong that the Party had to convene a
special conference, which was held at the end of June 1959 in the
mountain resort of Lushan, in central China.  At the conference the
defense minister, Marshal Peng Dehual, wrote a letter to Mao
criticizing what had happened in the Great Leap Forward and
recommending a realistic approach to the economy.  The letter was
actually rather restrained, and ended on the obligatory note of
optimism (in this case, catching up with Britain in four years).

But although Peng was one of Mao's oldest comrades, and one of the
people closest to him, Mao could not take even this slight criticism,
particularly at a time when he was on the defensive, because he knew he
was wrong.  Using the aggrieved language of which he was enamored, Mao
called the letter 'a bombardment intended to level Lushan."  He dug in
his heels and dragged the conference out for over a month, fiercely
attacking Marshal Peng.  Peng and the few who openly supported him were
branded 'rightist opportunists."  Peng was dismissed as defense
minister, placed under house arrest, and later sent into premature
retirement in Sichuan, where he was assigued a lowly post.

Mao had had to scheme hard to preserve his power.

In this he was a supreme master.  His favorite reading, which he
recommended to other Party leaders, was a classic multi-volume
collection about court power and intrigues.  In fact, Mao's rule was
best understood in terms of a medieval court, in which he exercised
spellbinding power over his courtiers and subjects.  He was also a
maestro at 'divide and rule," and at manipulating men's inclination to
throw others to the wolves.  In the end, few top officials stood up for
Marshal Peng, in spite of their private disenchantment with Mao's
policies.  The only one who avoided having to show his hand was the
general secretary of the Party, Deng Xiaoping, who had broken his leg.
Deng's stepmother had been grumbling at home, "I was a farmer all my
life and I have never heard of such a nonsensical way of farming?  When
Mao heard how Deng had broken his leg playing billiards he commented,
"How very convenient."

Commissar Li, the Sichuan first secretary, returned to Chengdu from the
conference with a document containing the remarks Peng had made at
Lushan.  This was distributed to officials of Grade 17 and above; they
were asked to state formally whether they agreed with it.

My father had heard something about the Lushan dispute from the
governor of Sichuan.  At his 'exam' meeOng my father made some vague
remarks about Penbes letter.

Then he did something he had never done before: he warned my mother
that it was a trap.  She was greatly moved.  This was the first time he
had ever put her interests before the rules of the Party.

She was surprised to see that a lot of other people seemed to have been
tipped off as well.  At her collective 'exam," half of her colleagues
showed flaming indignation against Peng's letter, and claimed the
criticisms in it were 'totally untrue."  Others looked as though they
had lost their ability to speak, and mumbled something evasive.  One
man managed to straddle the fence, saying, "I am not in a position to
agree or disagree because I do not know whether the evidence given by
Marshal Peng is factual or not.  If it is, I would support him.  Of
course, I would not if it were not true."

The chief of the grain bureau for Chengdu and the chief of the Chengdu
post office were Red Army veterans who had fought under Marshal Peng.
They both said they agreed with what their old and much-revered
commander had said, adding their own experiences in the countryside to
back up Peng's observations.  My mother wondered whether these old
soldiers knew about the trap.  If so, the way they spoke their minds
was heroic.

She wished she had their courage.  But she thought of her children what
would happen to them?  She was no longer the free spirit she had been
as a student.  When her turn came she said, "The views in the letter
are not in keeping with the policies of the Party over the last couple
of years."

She was told by her boss, Mr.  Guo, that her remarks were thoroughly
unsatisfactory because she had failed to state her attitude.  For days
she lived in a state of acute anxiety.  The Red Army veterans who had
supported Peng were denounced as 'rightist opportunists," sacked, and
sent to do manual labor.  My mother was called to a meeting to have her
'right-wing tendencies' criticized.  At the meeting, Mr.  Guo described
another of her 'serious errors."  In 1959 a sort of black market had
sprung up in Chengdu selling chickens and eggs.  Because the communes
had taken over chickens from individual peasants, and were incapable of
raising them, chickens and eggs had disappeared from the shops, which
were state owned.  A few peasants had somehow managed to keep one or
two chickens at home under their beds, and were now surreptitiously
selling them and their eggs in the back alleys at about twenty times
their previous price.  Officials were sent out every day to try to
catch the peasants.  Once, when my mother was asked by Mr.  Guo to go
on one of these raids, she said, "What's wrong with supplying things
people need?  If there is demand, there should be supply."  Because of
this remark, my mother was given a warning about her 'right-wing
tendencies."

The purge of 'rightist opportunists' rocked the Party once again, as a
great many officials agreed with Peng.  The lesson was that Mao's
authority was un challengeable even though he was clearly in the wrong.
Officials could see that no matter how high up you were Peng, after
all,

was the defense minister and no matter what your standing - Peng had
reputedly been Mao's favorite if you offended Mao you would fall into
disgrace.  They also knew that you could not speak your mind and
resign, or even resign quietly: resignation was seen as an unacceptable
protest.  There was no opting out.  The mouths of the Party as well as
the people were now tightly sealed.  After this, the Great Leap Forward
went into further, madder excesses.  More impossible economic goals
were imposed from on high.

More peasants were mobilized to make steel.  And more arbitrary orders
rained down, causing chaos in the countryside.

At the end of 1958, at the height of the Great Leap Forward, a massive
construction project was begun: ten great buildings in the capital,
Peking, to be completed in ten months to mark the tenth anniversary, x
October 1959, of the founding of the People's Republic.

One of the ten buildings was the Great Hall of the People, a
Soviet-style columned edifice on the west side of Tiananmen Square. Its
marbled front was a good quarter of a mile long, and its chandeliered
main banqueting hall could seat several thousand people. This was where
important meetings were to be held and the leaders were to receive
foreign visitors.  The rooms, all to be on a grand scale, were named
after the provinces of China.  My father was put in charge of the
decoration of the Sichuan Room, and when the work was completed he
invited Party leaders who had been connected with Sichuan to inspect
it.  Deng Xiaoping, who was from Sichuan, came, as did Marshal Ho Lung,
a famous Robin Hood figure who had been one of the founders of the Red
Army, and was a close friend of Deng's.

At one point my father was called away, leaving these two and another
old colleague of theirs, actually Deng's brother, chatting among
themselves.  As he came back into the room he heard Marshal Ho saying
to Deng's brother, while pointing at Deng: "It really should be him on
the throne."  At that moment they spotted my father and immediately
stopped talking.

My father was in a state of intense apprehension after this.  He knew
he had accidentally overheard hints of disagreements at the top of the
regime.  Any conceivable action, or inaction, could get him into deadly
trouble.  In fact, nothing happened to him, but when he told me about
the incident almost ten years later he said he had lived with the fear
of disaster ever since.

"Just to have heard that amounts to treason," he said, using a phrase
which means 'a crime bringing decapitation."

What he had overheard was nothing but an indication of some
disenchantment with Mao.  This sentiment was shared by many top
leaders, not least by the new president, Liu Shaoqi.

In autumn 1959 Liu came to Chengdu to inspect a commune called "Red
Splendor."  The previous year, Mao had been highly enthusiastic about
the astronomical rice output there.  Before Liu arrived the local
officials rounded up anyone they thought might expose them, and locked
them up in a temple.  But Liu had a 'mole," and as he was walking past
the temple he stopped and asked to have a look inside.  The officials
made various excuses, even claiming that the temple was about to
collapse, but Liu refused to take no for an answer.  Eventually the
big, rusty lock was clicked open, and a group of shabby peasants
stumbled out into the daylight.  The embarrassed local officials tried
to explain to Liu that these were 'troublemakers' who had been locked
up because they might harm the distinguished visitor.  The peasants
themselves were silent.  Commune officials, though completely impotent
regarding policies, held awesome power over people's lives.  If they
wanted to punish someone, they could give him the worst job to do, the
least food, and invent an excuse to have him harassed, denounced, even
arrested.

President Liu asked some questions, but the peasants just smiled and
mumbled.  From their point of view it was better to offend the
president than the local bosses.  The president would be leaving for
Peking in a few minutes, but the commune bosses would be with them for
the rest of their lives.

Shortly afterward another senior leader also came to Chengdu Marshal
Zhu De accompanied by one of Mao's private secretaries.  Zhu De was
from Sichuan and had been the commander of the Red Army, and military
architect of the Communists' victory.  Since 1949 he had kept a low
profile.  He visited several communes near Chengdu, and afterward, as
he strolled by the Silk River looking at the pavilions, bamboo groves,
and willow embraced teahouses along the riverbank, he waxed emotional:
"Sichuan is indeed a heavenly place .... He spoke the words in the
style of a line of poetry.  Mao's secretary added the matching line, in
the traditional poets' fashion:

"Pity that damning gales of lie telling and false communism are
destroying it!"  My mother was with them, and thought to herself: I
agree wholeheartedly.

Suspicious of his colleagues, and still angry about being attacked at
Lushan, Mao obstinately stuck to his crazy economic policies.  Although
he was not unaware of the disasters they had been causing, and was
discreetly allowing some of the most impracticable ones to be revised,
his 'face' would not allow him to give up completely.  Meanwhile, as
the sixties began, a great famine spread across the whole of China.

In Chengdu, the monthly food ration for each adult was reduced to 19
pounds of rice, 3.5 ounces of cooking off, and 3-5 ounces of meat, when
there was any.

Scarcely anything else was available, not even cabbage.

Many people were afflicted by edema, a condition in which fluid
accumulates under the skin because of malnutrition.

The patient turns yellow and swells up.  The most popular remedy was
eating chlorella, which was supposed to be rich in protein.  Chlorella
fed on human urine, so people stopped going to the toilet and peed into
spittoons instead, then dropped the chlorella seeds in; they grew into
something looking like green fish roe in a couple of days, and were
scooped out of the urine, washed, and cooked with rice.  They were
truly disgusting to eat, but did reduce the swelling.

Like everybody else, my father was entitled only to a limited food
ration.  But as a senior official he had some privileges.  In our
compound there were two canteens, a small one for depa~u'ental
directors and their wives and children, and a big one for everyone
else, which included my grandmother, my aunt Jun-ying, and the maid.
Most of the time we collected our food at the canteens and took it home
to eat.  There was more food in the canteens than on the streets.  The
provincial government had its own farm, and there were also 'presents'
from county governments.  These valuable supplies were divided between
the canteens, and the small one got preferential treatment.

As Party officials, my parents also had special food coupons.  I used
to go with my grandmother to a special store outside the compound to
buy food with them.  My mother's coupons were blue.  She was entitled
to five eggs, almost an ounce of soybeans, and the same amount of sugar
per month.  My father's coupons were yellow.  He was entitled to twice
as much as my mother because of his higher rank.

My family pooled the food from the canteens and the other sources and
ate together.  The adults always gave the children more, so I did not
go hungry.  But the adults all suffered from malnutrition, and my
grandmother developed slight edema.  She grew chlorella at home, and I
was aware that the adults were eating it, although they would not tell
me what it was for.  Once I tried a little, and immediately spat it out
as it tasted revolting.  I never had it again.

I had little idea that famine was raging all around me.

One day on my way to school, as I was eating a small steamed roll,
someone rushed up and snatched it from my hands.  As I was recovering
from the shock, I caught a glimpse of a very thin, dark back in shorts
and bare feet running down the mud alley with his hand to his mouth,
devouring the roll.  When I told my parents what had happened, my
father's eyes were terribly sad.  He stroked my head and said, "You are
lucky.  Other children like you are starving."

I often had to visit the hospital for my teeth at that time.

Whenever I went there I had an attack of nausea at the horrible sight
of dozens of people with shiny, almost transparent swollen limbs, as
big as barrels.  The patients were carried to the hospital on flat
carts, there were so many of them.  When I asked my dentist what was
wrong with them, she said with a sigh, "Edema."  I asked her what that
meant, and she mumbled something which I vaguely linked with food.

These people with edema were mostly peasants.  Starvation was much
worse in the countryside because there were no guaranteed rations.
Government policy was to provide food for the cities first, and commune
officials were having to seize gram from the peasants by force.  In
many areas, peasants who tried to hide food were arrested, or beaten
and tortured.  Commune officials who were reluctant to take food from
the hungry peasants were themselves dismissed, and some were physically
maltreated.  As a result, the peasants who had actually grown the food
died in the millions all over China.

I learned later that several of my relatives from Sichuan to Manchuria
had died in this famine.  Among them was my father's retarded brother.
His mother had died in 1958, and when the famine struck he was unable
to cope as he would not listen to anyone else's advice.  Rations were
allotted on a monthly basis, and he ate his within days, leaving
nothing for the rest of the month.  He soon starved to death.  My
grandmother's sister, Lan, and her husband, "Loyalty' Pei-o, who had
been sent to the inhospitable countryside in the far north of Manchuria
because of his old connection with Kuomintang intelligence, both died
too.  As food began to run out, the village authorities allocated
supplies according to their own, unwritten priorities.

Pei-o's outcast status meant that he and his wife were among the first
to be denied food.  Their children survived because their parents gave
their food to them.  The father of Yu-lin's wife also died.  At the
end, he had eaten the stuffing in his pillow and the braids of garlic
plants.

One night, when I was about eight, a tiny, very old looking woman, her
face a mass of wrinkles, walked into our house.  She looked so thin and
feeble it seemed a puff of wind would blow her down.  She dropped to
the ground in front of my mother and banged her forehead on the floor,
calling her 'the savior of my daughter."  She was our maid's mother.

"If it wasn't for you," she said, 'my daughter would not survive .... I
did not grasp the full meaning of this until a month later, when a
letter came for our maid.

It said that her mother had died soon after visiting our house, where
she had passed on the news that her husband and her younger son were
dead.  I will never forget the heart-rending sobs of our maid as she
stood on the terrace, leaning against a wooden pillar and stifling her
moans in her handkerchief.  My grandmother sat cross-legged on her bed,
weeping as well.  I hid myself in a corner outside my grandmother's
mosquito net.  I could hear my grandmother saying to herself: "The
Communists are good, but all these people are dead .... Years later, I
heard that our maid's other brother and her sister-in-law died soon
after this.

Landlords' families were placed at the bottom of the list for food in a
starving commune.

In ,989 an official who had been working in famine relief told me that
he believed that the total number of people who had died in Sichuan was
seven million.  This would be 10 percent of the entire population of a
rich province.  An accepted estimate for the death toll for the whole
country is around thirty million.

One day in 1960, the three-year-old daughter of my aunt Jun-ying's
next-door neighbor in Yibin went missing.

A few weeks later the neighbor saw a young girl playing in the street
wearing a dress that looked like her daughter's.

She went up and examined it: it had a mark which identified it as her
daughter's.  She reported this to the police.

It turned out that the parents of the young girl were selling
wind-dried meat.  They had abducted and murdered a number of babies and
sold them as rabbit meat at exorbitant prices.  The couple were
executed and the case was hushed up, but it was widely known that baby
killing did go on at the time.

Years later I met an old colleague of my father's, a very kind and
capable man, not given to exaggeration.  He told me with great emotion
what he had seen during the famine in one particular commune.
Thirty-five percent of the peasants had died, in an area where the
harvest had been good although little was collected, since the men had
been pulled out to produce steel, and the commune canteen had wasted a
large proportion of what there was.  One day a peasant burst into his
room and threw himself on the floor, screaming that he had committed a
terrible crime and begging to be punished.  Eventually it came out that
he had killed his own baby and eaten it.  Hunger had been like an
uncontrollable force driving him to take up the knife.  With tears
rolling down his cheeks, the official ordered the peasant to be
arrested.  Later he was shot as a warning to baby killers.

One official explanation for the famine was that Khrushchev had
suddenly forced China to pay back a large debt it had incurred during
the Korean War in order to come to the aid of North Korea.  The regime
played on the experience of much of the population, who had been
landless peasants and could remember being hounded by heartless
creditors to pay rent or reimburse loans.  By identifying the Soviet
Union, Mao also created an external enemy to take the blame and to
rally the population.

Another cause mentioned was 'unprecedented natural

calamities."  China is a vast country, and bad weather causes food
shortages somewhere every year.  No one but the highest leaders had
access to nationwide information about the weather.  In fact, given the
immobility of the population, few knew what happened in the next
region, or even over the next mountain.  Many thought then, and still
think today, that the famine was caused by natural disasters. I have no
full picture, but of all the people I have talked to from different
parts of China, few knew of natural calamities in their regions.  They
only have stories to tell about deaths from starvation.

At a conference for 7,000 top-ranking officials at the beginning of
1962, Mao said that the famine was caused 7o percent by natural
disasters and 3o percent by human error.  President Liu Shaoqi chipped
in, apparently on the spur of the moment, that it was caused 3o percent
by natural disasters and 7o percent by human error.  My father was at
the conference, and when he returned he said to my mother: "I fear
Comrade Shaoqi is going to be in trouble."

When the speeches were relayed to lower-rank officials like my mother,
President Liu's assessment was cut out.

The population at large was not even told about Mao's figures.  This
concealing of information did help keep the people quiet, and there
were no audible complaints against the Communist Party.  Quite apart
from the fact that most dissenters had been killed off or otherwise
suppressed in the past few years, whether the Communist Party was to
blame was far from clear to the general population.  There was no
corruption in the sense of officials hoarding grain.

Party officials were only marginally better off than the ordinary
people.  In fact, in some villages they themselves starved first and
died first.  The famine was worse than anything under the Kuomintang,
but it looked different:

in the Kuomintang days, starvation took place alongside blatant
unchecked extravagance.

Before the famine, many Communist officials from landlords' families
had brought their parents to stay with them in the cities.  When the
famine hit, the Party gave orders for these elderly men and women to be
sent back to their villages to share the hard life meaning starvation
with the local peasants.  The idea was that Communist officials should
not be seen to be using their privileges to benefit their 'class-enemy'
parents.  Some grandparents of friends of mine had to leave Chengdu and
died in the famine.

Most peasants lived in a world where they did not look much beyond the
boundary of the village, and they blamed the famine on their immediate
bosses for giving them all the catastrophic orders.  There were popular
rhymes to the effect that the Party leadership was good, only the
grass-roots officials were rotten.

The Great Leap Forward and the appalling famine shook my parents
deeply.  Although they did not have the full picture, they did not
believe that 'natural calamities' were the explanation.  But their
overwhelming feeling was one of guilt.  Working in the field of
propaganda, they were right in the center of the misinformation
machine.  To salve his conscience, and to avoid the dishonest daily
routine, my father volunteered to help with famine relief in the
communes.  This meant staying and starving with the peasants.  In doing
so, he was 'sharing weal and woo with the masses," in line with Mao's
instructions, but it was resented by his staff.  They had to take turns
going with him, which they hated, because it meant going hungry.

From late 1959 to 196I, in the worst period of the famine, I seldom saw
my father.  In the countryside he ate the leaves of sweet potatoos,
herbs, and tree bark like the peasants.  One day he was walking along a
bank between the paddy fields when he saw a skeletal peasant moving
extremely slowly, and with obvious difficulty, in the distance.  Then
the man suddenly disappeared.  When my father rushed over, he was lying
in the field, dead of starvation.

Every day my father was devastated by what he saw, although he hardly
saw the worst, because in the customary manner local officials
surrounded him everywhere he went.

But he suffered bad hepatomegaly and edema and deep depression. Several
times when he came back from his trips he went straight into the
hospital.  In the summer of 1961, he stayed there for months.  He had
changed.  He was no longer the assured puritan of yesteryear.  The
Party was not pleased with him.  He was criticized for 'letting his
revolutionary will wane' and ordered out of the hospital.

He took to spending a lot of time fishing.  Across from the hospital
there was a lovely river called the Jade Brook.

Willows bent over to stroke its surface with their curving shoots, and
clouds melted and solidified in their many reflections.  I used to sit
on its sloping bank gazing at the clouds and watching my father fish.
The smell was of human manure.  On top of the bank were the hospital
grounds, which had once been flowerbeds, but had now been turned into
vegetable fields to supply the staff and patients with additional food.
When I close my eyes now, I can still see the larvae of the butterflies
eating away at the cabbage leaves.  My brothers caught them for my
father to use as bait.  The fields had a pathetic look.

The doctors and nurses were obviously no experts on farming.

Throughout history Chinese scholars and mandarins had traditionally
taken up fishing when they were disillusioned with what the emperor was
doing.  Fishing suggested a retreat to nature, an escape from the
politics of the day.  It was a kind of symbol for disenchantment and
noncooperation.

My father seldom caught any fish, and once wrote a poem with the line:
"Not for the fish I go fishing."  But his angling companion, another
deputy director of his department, always gave him part of his catch.
This was because in 1961, in the middle of the famine, my mother was
pregnant again, and the Chinese regard fish as essential for the
development of a baby's hair.  She had not wanted another

3 I4 "Capable Women Can Make a Meal without Food' child.  Among other
things, she and my father were on salaries, which meant the state no
longer provided them with wet-nurses or nannies.  With four children,
my grandmother, and part of my father's family to support, they did not
have a lot of money to spare.  A large chunk of my father's salary went
for buying books, particularly huge volumes of classical works, one set
of which could cost two months' salary.  Sometimes my mother grumbled
slightly:

other people in his position dropped hints to the publishing houses and
got their copies free, 'for work purposes."  My father insisted on
paying for everything.

Sterilization, abortion, and even contraception were difficult.  The
Communists had started promoting family planning in 1954, and my mother
was in charge of the program in her district.  She was then in an
advanced stage of pregnancy with Xiao-her, and often started her
meetings with a good-humored self-criticism.  But Mao turned against
birth control.  He wanted a big, powerful China, based on a large
population.  He said that if the Americans dropped atomic bombs on
China, the Chinese would 'just go on reproducing' and reconstitute
their numbers at great speed.  He also shared the traditional Chinese
peasant's attitude toward children: the more hands the better.  In
1957, he personally named a famous Peking University professor who had
advocated birth control as a rightist.  After that, family planning was
seldom mentioned.

My mother had become pregnant in 1959, and had written to the Party
asking for permission to have an abortion.

This was the standard procedure.  One reason the Party had to give its
consent was that the operation was a dangerous one at the time.  My
mother had said that she was busy working for the revolution, and could
serve the people better if she did not have another baby.  She was
granted an abortion, which was dreadfully painful because the method
used was primitive.  When she became pregnant again in 1961, another
abortion was out of the question in the opinion of the doctors, my
mother herself, and the Party., which stipulated a minimum three-year
gap between abortions.

Our maid was also pregnant.  She had married my father's former
manservant, who was now working in a factory.  My grandmother cooked
both of them the eggs and soybeans which could be obtained with my
parents' coupons, as well as the fish which my father and his colleague
caught.

Our maid gave birth to a boy at the end of 1961 and left to set up her
own home with her husband.  When she was still with us, she would go to
the canteens to fetch our food.  One day my father saw her walking
along a garden path stuffing some meat into her mouth and chewing
voraciously.  He turned and walked away in case she saw him and was
embarrassed.  He did not tell anyone until years later when he was
ruminating over how differently things had turned out from the dreams
of his youth, the main one of which had been putting an end to
hunger.

When the maid left, my family could not afford another one, because of
the food situation.  Those who wanted the job women from the
countryside were not entitled to a food allocation.  So my grandmother
and my aunt had to look after the five of us.

My youngest brother, Xiao-fang, was born on 17 January 1962.  He was
the only one of us who was breast-fed by my mother.  Before he was
born, my mother had wanted to give him away, but by the time he arrived
she had become deeply attached to him, and he became the favorite.  We
all played with him as though he were a big toy.  He grew up surrounded
by loving crowds, which, my mother ,~o.

"dieved, accounted for his ease and confidence.  My father spent a lot
of time with him, which he had never done with his other children. When
Xiao-fang was old enough to play with toys, my father carried him every
Saturday to the depa,hnent store at the top of the street and bought
him a new toy.  The moment Xiao-fang started to cry, for any
reason, my father
would drop everything and rush to comfort him.

By the beginning of 1961, tens of millions of deaths had finally forced
Mao to give up his economic policies.  Reluctantly, he allowed the
pragmatic President Liu and Deng Xiaoping, general secretary of the
Party, more control over the country.  Mao was forced to make
self-criticisms, but they were full of self-pity, and were always
phrased in such a way that it sounded as if he was carrying the cross
for incompetent officials all over China.  He further magnanimously
instructed the Party to 'draw lessons' from the disastrous experience,
but what the lessons were was not left to the judgment of the lowly
officials: Mao told them they had become divorced from the people, and
had made decisions which did not reflect ordinary people's feelings.

Starting from Mao, the endless self-criticisms masked the real
responsibility, which no one pursued.

Nevertheless, things began to improve.  The pragmatists put through a
succession of major reforms.  It was in this context that Deng Xiaoping
made the remark: "It doesn't matter whether the cat is white or black,
as long as it catches mice."  There was to be no more mass production
of steel.  A stop was put to crazy economic goals, and realistic
policies were introduced.  Public canteens were abolished, and
peasants' income was now related to their work.  They were given back
household property, which had been confiscated by the communes,
including farm implements and domestic animals.  They were also allowed
small plots of land to till privately.  In some areas, land was
effectively leased out to peasant households.  In industry and
commerce, elements of a market economy were officially sanctioned, and
within a couple of years the economy was flourishing again.

Hand in hand with the loosening up of the economy, there was also
political liberalization.  Many landlords had the label of 'class
enemy' removed.  A large number of people who had been purged in the
various political campaigns were 'rehabilitated."  These included the
counterrevolution ari from 1955, 'rightists' from 1957, and 'rightist
opportunists' from 1959.  Because my mother had received a warning for
her 'right-wing tendencies' in 1959, in 1962 she was raised from Grade
17 to Grade 16 in her civil service rank as compensation.  There was
greater literary and artistic freedom.  A more relaxed general
atmosphere prevailed.  For my father and mother, as for many others,
the regime seemed to be showing it could correct and learn from its
mistakes and that it could work and this restored their confidence in
it.

While all this was going on I lived in a cocoon behind the high walls
of the government compound.  I had no direct contact with tragedy.  It
was with these 'noises off' that I embarked on my teens.

13.  "Thousand-Gold

Ultle Precious' In a Priwlelled Cocoon

(1P58-1965)

When my mother took me to register at primary school in 1958, I was
wearing a new pink cord jacket and green flannel trousers with a huge
pink ribbon in my hair.  We went straight into the office of the
headmistress, who was waiting for us with the academic supervisor and
one of the teachers.  They were all smiling, and they addressed my
mother respectfully as "Director Xia' and treated her like a V.I.P.
Later I learned that the school came under my mother's depariment.

I had this special interview because I was six, and nor really they
only took children from the age of seven, as there was a shortage of
schools.  But even my father did not mind the rules being bent this
time, as he and my mother both wanted me to start school early.  My
fluent recitation of classical poems and my handsome calligraphy
convinced the school I was advanced enough.  After I had satisfied the
headmistress and her colleagues in the standard entrance test, I was
accepted as a special case.  My parents were tremendously proud of me.
Many of their

In a Privileged Cocoon 319 colleagues' children had been turned down by
this school.

Everyone wanted to get their children into this school because it was
the best in Chengdu, and the top 'key' school for the whole province.
It was very difficult to get into the key schools and universities.
Entrance was strictly on merit, and children from officials' families
were not given priority.

Whenever I was introduced to a new teacher, it was always as 'the
daughter of Director Chang and Director Xia."  My mother often came to
the school on her bicycle as part of her job, to check on how it was
being run.  One day the weather suddenly turned cold, and she brought a
warm green cord jacket with flowers embroidered on the front for me.
The headmistress herself came to my classroom to give it to me.  I was
terribly embarrassed with all my classmates staring at me.  Like most
children, I just wanted to belong and to be accepted as part of my peer
group.

We had exams every week and the results were put up on the notice
board.  I was always at the top of the class, which was rather resented
by those behind me.  They sometimes took their bitterness out on me by
calling me 'thousand-gold little precious' (qian-jin xiao-jie), doing
things like putting a frog in my desk drawer, and tying the ends of my
plaits to the back of my seat.  They said I had no 'collective spirit'
and looked down on others.  But I knew I simply liked being on my
own.

The curriculum was like that in a Western school, except during the
period when we had to produce steel.  There was no political education,
but we did have to do a lot of sports: running, high jump and long
jump, as well as compulsory, gym and swimming.  We each had one after
school sport: I was selected for tennis.  At first my father was
against the prospect of my becoming a sportswoman, which was the
purpose of the training, but the tennis coach, a very pretty young
woman, came to see him, dressed in her fetching shorts.  Among his
other jobs, my father was

32o "Thousand-Gold Little Precious' in charge of sports for the
province.  The coach gave him her most charming smile and told him that
since tennis, the most elegant of sports, was not played much in China
at the time, it would be good if his daughter set an example - 'for the
nation," as she put it.  My father had to give in.

I loved my teachers, who were excellent and had the girl of making
their subjects fascinating and exciting.  I remember the science
teacher, a Mr.  Dali who taught us the theory behind putting a
satellite into orbit (the Russians had just launched the first Sputnik)
and the possibility of visiting other planets.  Even the most unruly
boys were glued to their seats during his lessons.  I overheard some
pupils saying that he had been a rightist, but none of us knew what
this meant, and it did not make any difference to us.

My mother told me years later that Mr.  Dali had been a writer of
children's science fiction.  He was named a rightist in 1957 because he
had written an article about mice stealing food and fattening
themselves up, which was alleged to be a covert attack on Party
officials.  He was banned from writing, and was about to be sent to the
countryside when my mother managed to get him relocated to my school.
Few officials were brave enough to reemploy a rightist.

My mother was, and this was the very reason she was in charge of my
school.  According to its location, it should have come under the
Western District of Chengdu.  But the city authorities assigned it to
my mother's district in the east because they wanted it to have the
best teachers, even if they came from 'undesirable' backgrounds, and
the head of the Public Affairs Department of the Western District would
not dare to give such people jobs.  The academic supervisor in my
school was the wife of a former Kuomintang officer who was in a labor
camp.  Usually people with a background like hers would not have been
able to occupy a job like this, but my mother refused to transfer them,
and even gave them honorary grades.  Her superiors approved, but they
wanted her to take the responsibility for this unorthodox behavior. She
did not mind.

With the implicit additional protection which my father's position
brought her, she felt more secure than her colleagues.

In 1962 my father was invited to send his children to a new school that
had just been set up next to the compound where we lived.  It was
called "Plane Tree' after the trees which formed an avenue on the
grounds.  The school was set up by the Western District with the
express purpose of making it into a key school, since there was no key
school under the jurisdiction of this district.  Good teachers were
transferred to Plane Tree from other schools in the district.

The school soon acquired a reputation as the 'aristocratic school' for
the children of VIPs in the provincial government.

Before Plane Tree was set up there had been one boarding school in
Chengdu, for the children of top army officers.  A few senior ci 'vdian
officials also sent their children there.  Its academic level was poor,
and it earned a reputation for snobbery, as the children were highly
competitive about their parents.  They could often be heard saying
things like: "My father is a division commander.

Yours is ouly a brigadier!"  At weekends there were long lines of cars
outside, with nannies, bodyguards, and chauffeurs waiting to take the
children home.  Many people thought the atmosphere was poisoning the
children, and my parents had always been totally averse to this
school.

Plane Tree was not set up as an exclusive school, and after meeting the
headmaster and some of the teachers, my parents felt that it was
committed to high ethical standards and discipline.  There were only
about twenty-five pupils in each year.  Even in my previous school
there had been fifty pupils in my class.  The advantages of Plane Tree
were, of course, partly intended for the benefit of the top

322 "Thousand-Gold Little Precious' officials who lived next door, but
my newly mellowed father overlooked this fact.

Most of my new classmates were children of officials in the provincial
government.  Some lived in the compound with me.  Apart from school,
the compound was my entire world.  The gardens were filled with flowers
and luxuriant plants.  There were palm trees, sisal hemps, oleanders,
magnolias, camellias, roses, hibiscus, and even a pair of rare Chinese
aspens which had grown toward each other and intertwined their arms,
like lovers.  They were very sensitive, too.  If we scratched one of
the trunks even ever so gently the two trees would tremble and their
leaves would start to flutter.  During the summer lunch breaks I would
sit on a drum-shaped stone stool under a trellis of wisteria, my elbows
resting on a stone table reading a book or playing chess.  Around me
were the blazing colors of the grounds and not far away a rare coconut
tree thrust arrogantly into the sky.  My favorite, though, was a
heavily scented jasmine, also climbing on a big trellis.  When it was
in blossom, my room was filled with its fragrance.  I loved to sit by
the window gazing at it and soaking up the delicious smell.

When we first moved into the compound we lived in a lovely detached
one-story house set in its own courtyard.

It was built in traditional Chinese style, with no modern facilities:
no running water indoors, no flush toilet, no ceramic bath.  In 1961,
some modern Western-type apartments with all these amenities were built
in one corner of the compound, and my family was assigned one of
them.

Before we moved in, I visited this wonderland and examined all the
novel and magical taps and flush toilets and mirrored cupboards on the
walls.  I ran my hand along the shiny white files on the walls of the
bathrooms.  They felt cool and pleasant to the touch.

There were thirteen apartment blocks in the compound.

Four were for the directors of departments, the rest for bureau chiefs.
Our apartment occupied a whole floor,

whereas the bureau chiefs had to share a floor between two families.
Our rooms were more spacious.  We had anti mosquito screens on our
inner windows, which they did not, and two bathrooms, while they had
only one.  We had hot water three days a week, whereas they had none. 
We had a telephone, which was extremely rare in China, and they did
not. Lesser officials occupied blocks in a smaller compound on the
other side of the street, and their amenities were one grade lower
still. The half-dozen Party secretaries who formed the core of the
provincial leadership had their own inner compound within our compound.
This inner sanctum lay behind two gates, which were guarded
around-the-clock by army guards with guns, and only specially
authorized personnel were allowed through.

Inside these gates were detached two-story houses, one for each Party
secretary.  On the doorstep of the first secretary, Li Jing-quan, stood
yet another armed guard.  I grew up taking hierarchy and privilege for
granted.

All adults working in the main compound had to show their passes when
they came through the main gate.  We children had no passes, but the
guards recognized us.

Things became complicated if we had visitors.  They had to fill out
forms, then the porter's lodge would ring our apartment and someone had
to go all the way down to the front gate to collect them.  The staff
did not welcome other children.  They said they did not want the
grounds messed up.  This discouraged us from bringing friends home, and
during the whole of my four years in the top key school I invited
girlfriends home only a very few times.

I hardly ever went outside the compound except to go to school.  A few
times I went to a depa~is,lent store with my grandmother, but I never
felt the need to buy anything.

Shopping was an alien concept to me, and my parents gave me pocket
money only on special occasions.  Our canteen was like a restaurant,
and served excellent food.  Except during the famine, there were always
at least seven or eight dishes from which to choose.  The chefs were
handpicked,

and were all either 'grade one' or 'special grade."  Top chefs were
graded like teachers.  At home, there were always sweets and fruit.
There was nothing else I wanted to eat except ice 1ollies.  Once, on
Children's Day, I June, when I was given some pocket money, I ate
twenty-six in one go.

Life in the compound was self-contained.  It had its own shops,
hairdressers, cinemas, and dance halls, as well as plumbers and
engineers.  Dancing was very popular.  On weekends there were different
dancing parties for the different levels of staff in the provincial
government.  The one in the former US servicemen's ballroom was for
families at and above the level of bureau chief.  It always had an
orchestra, and actors and actresses from the Provincial Song and Dance
Troupe to make it more colorful and elegant.  Some of the actresses
used to come to our apartment to chat with my parents, and then they
would take me for a walk around the compound.  I was terribly proud to
be seen in their company, as actors and actresses were endowed with
tremendous glamour in China.  They enjoyed special tolerance and were
allowed to dress more flamboyantly than other people, and even to have
affairs.

Since the troupe came under his department, my father was their boss.
But they did not defer to him like other people.  They used to tease
him and call him 'the star dancer."  My father just smiled and looked
shy.  The dancing was a kind of casual ballroom dancing, and the
couples glided up and down rather demurely on the highly polished
floor.  My father was indeed a good dancer, and he obviously enjoyed
himself.  My mother was no good at it she could not get the rhythm
right, so she did not like it.

During the intervals, the children were allowed onto the dance floor,
and we pulled each other by the hands and did a kind of floor skiing.
The atmosphere, the heat, the perfume, the glamorously dressed ladies
and beaming gentlemen formed a dreamy, magical world for me.

There were films every Saturday evening.  In 1962, with the more
relaxed atmosphere, there were even some from

Hong Kong, mostly love stories.  They gave a glimpse of the outside
world, and were very popular.  There were also, of course, uplifting
revolutionary films.  The screenings were held in two different places,
according to status.  The elite one was in a spacious hall with big,
comfortable seats.

The other was in a large auditorium in a separate compound and was
jam-packed.  I went there once because it was showing a film I wanted
to see.  The seats had all been taken long before the film started.
Latecomers had to bring their own stools.  Lots of people were
standing.  If you were stuck at the back, you had to stand on a chair
to see anything.  I had no idea it was going to be like this, and had
not brought a stool.  I was caught in the crush at the back, unable to
see a thing.  I glimpsed a chef I knew who was standing on a short
bench which could seat two people.

When he saw me squeezing past, he asked me to get on it with him.  It
was very narrow and I felt terribly unsteady.

People kept pushing by, and soon one of them knocked me off.  I fell
quite hard and cut my eyebrow on the edge of a stool.  The scar is
still there today.

In our elite hall there were more restricted films which were not shown
to anyone else, even the staff in the big auditorium.  These were
called 'reference films' and were made up mostly of clips of films from
the West.  This was the first time I ever saw a miniskirt or the
Beatles.  I remember one film showed a Peeping Tom at the seaside;

the women he had been peeping at poured a bucket of water over him.
Another extract from a documentary showed abstract painters using a
chimpanzee to daub ink on a sheet of paper and a man playing the piano
with his bottom.

I suppose these must have been selected to show how decadent the West
was.  They were only for high Party officials, and even they were
denied access to most information about the West.  Occasionally, a film
from the West was shown in a small screening room where children were
not allowed.  I was intensely curious and begged my parents to take me.
They agreed a couple of times.  By then my father had become quite soft
with us.  There was a guard at the door, but because I was with my
parents, he did not object.  The films were totally beyond me.  One
seemed to be about an American pilot going mad after dropping an atom
bomb on Japan.  The other was a black-and-white feature film.  In one
scene a trade union leader was punched by two thugs in a car: blood
trickled out of the corner of his mouth.  I was absolutely horrified.
This was the first time in my life I had ever seen an act of violence
with blood being shed (corporal punishment in schools had been
abolished by the Communists).  Chinese films in those days were gentle,
sentimental, and uplifting; if there was even a hint of violence it was
stylized, as in Chinese opera.

I was baffled by the way the Western workers were dressed in neat suits
that were not even patched, a far cry from my idea of what the
oppressed masses in a capitalist country ought to be wearing.  After
the film I asked my mother about this and she said something about
'relative living standards."  I did not understand what she meant, and
the question remained with me.

As a child, my idea of the West was that it was a miasma of poverty and
misery, like that of the homeless "Little Match Girl' in the Hans
Christian Andersen story.  When I was in the boarding nursery and did
not want to finish my food, the teacher would say: "Think of all the
starving children in the capitalist world!"  In school, when they were
trying to make us work harder, the teachers often said:

"You are lucky to have a school to go to and books to read.

In the capitalist countries children have to work to support their
hungry families."  Often when adults wanted us to accept something they
would say that people in the West wanted it, but could not get it, and
therefore we should appreciate our good fortune.  I came to think this
way automatically.  When I saw a girl in my class wearing a new kind of
pink translucent raincoat I had never seen, I thought how nice it would
be to swap my commonplace old

In a Privileged Cocoon 3 z7 wax-paper umbrella for one.  But I
immediately castigated myself for this 'bourgeois' tendency, and wrote
in my diary: "Think of all the children in the capitalist world they
can't even think of owning an umbrella!"

In my mind foreigners were terrifying.  All Chinese have black hair and
brown eyes, so they regard differently colored hair and eyes as
strange.  My image of a foreigner was more or less the official
stereotype: a man with red, unkempt hair, strange-colored eyes, very,
very long nose, stumbling around drunk, pouring Coca-Cola into his
mouth from a bottle, with his legs splayed out in a most inelegant
position.  Foreigners said 'hello' all the time, with an odd
intonation.  I did not know what 'hello' meant; I thought it was a
swear word.  When boys played 'guerrilla warfare," which was their
version of cowboys and Indians, the enemy side would have thorns glued
onto their noses and say 'hello' all the time.

During my third year in primary school, when I was nine, my classmates
and I decided to decorate our classroom with plants.  One of the girls
suggested she could get some unusual ones from a garden which her
father looked after at a Catholic church on Safe Bridge Street.  There
had once been an orphanage attached to the church, but it had been
closed down.  The church was still functioning, under the control of
the government, which had forced Catholics to break with the Vatican
and join a 'patriotic' organization.  The idea of a church was both
mysterious and frightening, because of the propaganda about religion.

The first time I ever heard about rape was reading about one attributed
to a foreign priest in a novel.  Priests also invariably appeared as
imperialist spies and evil people who used babies from orphanages for
medical experiments.

Every day on my way to and from school, I used to walk past the top of
scholar-tree-lined Safe Bridge Street and see the profile of the church
gate.  To my Chinese eye, it had the most alien-looking pillars: they
were made of white marble, and were fluted in the Greek style,
whereas

3z8 "Thousand-Gold Little Precious' Chinese pillars were always made of
painted wood.  I was dying to look inside, and had asked the girl to
let me visit her home, but she said her father did not want her to
bring any visitors.  This only increased the mystery.  When this girl
offered to get some plants from her garden I eagerly volunteered to go
with her.

As we approached the church gate I tensed up and my heart almost
stopped beating.  It seemed to be the most imposing gate I had ever
seen.  My friend stood on tiptoe and reached up to bang a metal ring on
the gate.  A small door creaked open in the gate, revealing a wrinkled
old man, bent almost double.  To me he seemed like a witch in one of
the illustrations in a fairy tale.  Although I could not see his face
clearly, I imagined that he had a long hooked nose and pointed hat and
was about to ride up into the sky on a broomstick.  The fact that he
was of a different sex from a witch was irrelevant to me.  Avoiding
looking at him, I hurried through the doorway.  Immediately in front of
me was a garden in a small, neat courtyard.  I was so nervous I could
not see what was in it.  My eyes could only register a proliferation of
colors and shapes, and a small fountain trickling in the middle of a
rockery.  My friend took my hand and led me along the arcade around the
courtyard.  On the far side, she opened a door and told me that that
was where the priest delivered his sermons.

Sermons!  I had come across this word in a book in which the priest
used his 'sermon' to pass state secrets to another imperialist spy.  I
tensed up even more when I crossed the threshold into a large, dark
room, which seemed to be a hall; for a moment I could not see anything.
Then I saw a statue at the end of the hall.  This was my first
encounter with a crucifix.  As I got nearer, the figure on the cross
seemed to be hovering over me, enormous and crushing.

The blood, the posture, and the expression on the face combined to
produce an utterly terrifying sensation.  I turned and dashed out of
the church.  Outside, I nearly collided with a man in a black robe.  He
stretched out a hand to steady me; I thought he was trying to grab me,
and dodged and rushed away.  Somewhere behind me a heavy door creaked.
The next moment it was terrifyingly still except for the murmuring of
the fountain.  I opened the small door in the front gate and ran all
the way to the end of the street without stopping.  My heart was
pounding and my head was spinning.

Unlike me, my brother Jin-ming, who was born a year after me, was
independent-minded from a young age.  He loved science and read a lot
of popular scientific magazines.

Although these, like all other publications, carried the inevitable
propaganda, they did report advances in science and technology in the
West, and these impressed Jin-ming enormously.  He was fascinated by
photographs of lasers, Hovercraft, helicopters, electronics, and cars
in these magazines, in addition to the glimpses he got of the West in
the 'reference films."  He began to feel that school, the media, and
adults in general could not be trusted when they said that the
capitalist world was hell and China was paradise.

The United States in particular caught Jin-ming's imagination as the
country with the most highly developed technology.  One day when he was
eleven and was excitedly describing new developments in lasers in
America over the dinner table, he said to my father that he adored
America.

My father was at a loss about how to respond, and looked deeply
worried.  Eventually he strokedJin-ming's head and said to my mother,
"What can we do?  This child is going to grow up to become a
rightist!"

Before he was twelve, Jin-ming had made a number of 'inventions' based
on illustrations in children's science books, including a telescope
with which he tried to observe Halley's Comet and a microscope using
glass from a light bulb.  One day he was trying to improve a repeating
rubberband 'gun' which fired small stones and yew nuts.  In order to
create the right sound effect he asked a classmate of his,

whose father was an army officer, to find him some empty bullet
casings.  His friend got hold of some bullets, took off the ends,
emptied out the gunpowder, and gave them to Jin-ming without realizing
that the detonators were still inside.  Jin-ming filled a shell with a
cut-up toothpaste tube and held it over the coal stove in the kitchen
with tongs to bake it.  There was a kettle sitting on a grill over the
coal, and Jin-ming was holding the tongs under it when suddenly there
was an enormous bang, and a big hole in the bottom of the kettle.
Everyone rushed in to see what had happened.  Jin-ming was terrified.
Not because of the explosion, but because of my father, who was a very
intimidating figure.

But my father did not hit Jin-ming, or even scold him.

He just looked at him hard for a while, then said he was already scared
enough, and should go outside and take a walk.  Jin-ming was so
relieved he could hardly keep from jumping up and down.  He never
thought he would get off so easily.  After his walk, my father said he
was not to do any more experiments without being supervised by an
adult.  But he did not enforce this order for long, and soon Jin-ming
was carrying on as before.

I helped him with a couple of his projects.  Once we made a model
pulverizer powered by tap water which could crush chalk into powder.
Jin-ming provided the brains and the skill, of course.  My interest
never lasted.

Jin-ming went to the same key primary school as I did.

Mr.  Dali the science teacher who had been condemned as a rightist,
also taught him, and played a crucial role in opening up the world of
science to him.  Jin-ming has remained deeply grateful to him all his
life.

My second brother, Xiao-her, who was born in 1954, was my grandmother's
favorite, but he did not get much attention from my father and mother.
One of the reasons was that they thought he got enough affection from
my grandmother.  Sensing he was not in favor, Xiao-her became defensive
toward my parents.  This irritated them,

especially my father, who could not stand anything he considered un
straightforward

Sometimes he was so enraged by Xiao-her that he beat him.  But he would
regret it afterward, and at the first opportunity he would stroke
Xiao-her on the head and tell him he was sorry he had lost control of
his temper.  My grandmother would have a tearful row with my father,
and he would accuse her of spoiling Xiao-her.  This was a constant
source of tension between them.  Inevitably, my grandmother grew even
more attached to Xiao-her and spoiled him even more.

My parents thought that only their sons should be scolded and hit, and
not their daughters.  One of the only two times when my sister,
Xiao-hong, was hit was when she was five.  She had insisted on eating
sweets before a meal, and when the food came she complained that she
could not taste anything because of the sweet taste in her mouth.  My
father told her she had only got what she wanted.  Xiao-hong took
umbrage at this and started yelling and threw her chopsticks across the
dining room.  My father smacked her and she grabbed a feather duster to
hit him.  He snatched the duster away from her, so she got hold of a
broom.  After some scuffling, my father locked her in our bedroom and
kept saying, "Too spoiled!  Too spoiled!"  My sister missed her
lunch.

Xiao-hong was quite willful as a child.  For some reason, she
absolutely refused to watch films or plays, or to travel.

And there were a lot of things she hated eating: she would scream her
head off when she was fed milk, beef, or lamb.

When I was a child, I followed her example, and missed out on many
films and a lot of delicious food.

My character was very different, and people said I was both sensible
and sensitive (dong-shl) well before my teens.

My parents never laid a hand on me or said a harsh word to me.  Even
their rare criticisms were delivered extremely delicately, as if I were
a grown-up and easily wounded.

They gave me plenty of love, particularly my father, who always took
his after-supper walk with me, and often took me with him when he
visited his friends.  Most of his closest friends were veteran
rev,~lutionaries, intelligent and able, and they all seemed to have
something 'wrong' in their pasts in the eyes of the Party, and so had
been given only lowly posts.  One had been in the branch of the Red
Army led by Mao's challenger Zhang Guo-tao.  Another was a Don Juan-
his wife, a Party official whom my father always tried to avoid, was
insufferably stern.  I enjoyed these adult gatherings, but I liked
nothing better than to be alone with my books, which I sat reading all
day during my school holidays, chewing the ends of my hair.  Apart from
literature, including some reasonably simple classical poems, I loved
science fiction and adventure stories.  I remember one book about a man
spending what seemed to him to be a few days on another planet and
coming back to earth in the twenty-first century, finding everything
had changed.

People ate food capsules, traveled by Hovercraft, and had telephones
with video screens.  I longed to be living in the twenty-first century
with all these magic gadgets.

I spent my childhood racing toward the future, hurrying to be an adult,
and was always daydreaming about what I would do when I was older. From
the moment I could read and write, I preferred books with substantial
amounts of words to picture books.  I was also impatient in every other
way: when I had a sweet, I would never suck it, but bit into it and
chewed it at once.  I even chewed my cough lozenges.

My siblings and I got on unusually well.  Traditionally, boys and girls
seldom played together, but we were good friends and cared about each
other.  There was little jealousy or competitiveness, and we rarely had
rows.  Whenever my sister saw me crying, she would burst into tears
herself.  She did not mind hearing people praising me.  The good
relationship between us was much commented on, and parents of other
children were constantly asking my parents how they did it.

Between them my parents and my grandmother provided a loving family
atmosphere.  We saw only affection between our parents, never their
quarrels.  My mother never showed us her disenchantment with my father.
After the famine, my parents, like most officials, were no longer as
passionately devoted to their work as they had been in the 195os.
Family life took a more prominent place, and was no longer equated with
disloyalty.  My father, now over forty, mellowed and became closer to
my mother.  My parents spent more time together, and as I was growing
up I often saw evidence of their love for each other.

One day I heard my father telling my mother about a compliment paid to
her by one of his colleagues, whose wife had the reputation of being a
beauty.

"The two of us are lucky to have such outstanding wives," he had said
to my father.

"Look around: they stand out from everyone else."  My father was
beaming, recalling the scene with restrained delight.

"I smiled politely, of course," he said.

"But I was really thinking, How can you compare your wife with mine? My
wife is in a class of her own!"

Once my father went away on a three-week sight-seeing tour for the
directors of the Public Affairs departments of every province in China,
which was to take them all over the country.  It was the only such tour
ever given in the whole of my father's career and was supposed to be a
special treat.  The group enjoyed V.I.P treatment all the way, and a
photographer traveled with them, recording their progress.  But my
father was restless.  By the start of the third week, when the tour had
reached Shanghai, he missed home so much that he said he did not feel
well, and flew back to Chengdu.  Forever afterward, my mother would
call him a 'silly old thing."

"Your home wouldn't have flown away.  I wouldn't have disappeared.  Not
in that week, anyway.  What a chance you missed to have fun!"  I always
had a feeling when she said this that she was really quite pleased
about my father's 'silly homesickness."

In their relationship with their children, my parents seemed to be
concerned above all with two things.  One was our academic education.
No matter how preoccupied they were with their jobs, they always went
through our homework with us.  They were in constant touch with our
teachers, and firmly established in our heads that our goal in life was
academic excellence.  Their involvement in our studies increased after
the famine, when they had more spare time.  Most evenings, they took
turns giving us extra lessons.

My mother was our math teacher, and my father tutored us in Chinese
language and literature.  These evenings were solemn occasions for us,
when we were allowed to read my father's books in his study, which was
lined from floor to ceiling with thick hardbacks and thread-bound
Chinese classics.  We had to wash our hands before we turned the leaves
of his books.  We read Lu Xun, the great modern Chinese writer, and
poems from the golden ages of Chinese poetry, which were considered
difficult even for adults.

My parents' attention to our studies was matched only by their concern
for our education in ethics.  My father wanted us to grow up to be
honorable and principled citizens, which was what he believed the
Communist revolution was all about.  In keeping with Chinese tradition,
he gave a name to each of my brothers which represented his ideals:
Zhi, meaning 'honest," to Jin-ming; Pu, 'unpretentious," to Xiao-her;
and Fang, 'incorruptible," was part of Xiao-fang's name.  My father
believed that these were the qualities which had been lacking in the
old China and which the Communists were going to restore.  Corruption,
in particular, had sapped the old China.  Once he rebuked Jin-ming for
making a paper airplane out of a sheet of paper with his dep~iment
letterhead on it.  If we ever wanted to use the telephone at home we
had to get his permission.  As his job covered the media, he was
supplied with a lot of newspapers and periodicals.  He encouraged us to
read them, but they could not be taken out of his study.  At the end of
the month he took them back to his department, as old newspapers were
sold for recycling.  I spent many tedious Sundays helping him check
that not one was missing.

My father was always very strict with us, which was a constant source
of tension between him and my grandmother, and between him and us.  In
1965 one of the daughters of Prince Sihanouk of Cambodia came to
Chengdu to give a ballet performance.  This was a great novelty in a
society which was almost totally isolated.  I was dying to see the
ballet.  Because of his job, my father was given complimentary tickets,
the best, for all new performances, and he often took me.  This time,
for some reason, he could not go.  He gave me a ticket but said I had
to exchange it with somebody with a seat at the back so that I would
not be in the best seat.

That evening I stood by the door of the theater, holding my ticket in
my hand, while the audience crowded in all, in fact, with complimentary
tickets, allocated according to their rank.  A good quarter of an hour
passed and I was still by the door.  I was too embarrassed to ask
anyone to swap.  Eventually the number of people going in thinned out;
the performance was about to start.  I was on the verge of tears,
wishing I had a different father.  At that moment I saw a junior
official from my father's department.  I summoned up my courage and
pulled the edge of his jacket from behind.  He smiled and immediately
agreed to let me have his seat, which was right at the back.  He was
not surprised.  My father's strictness to his children was legendary in
our compound.

For Chinese New Year, 1965, a special performance was organized for
schoolteachers.  This time my father went to the performance with me,
but instead of letting me sit with him, he exchanged my ticket for one
at the very back.  He said it was inappropriate for me to sit in front
of the teachers.  I could hardly see the stage, and felt miserable.

Later I heard from the teachers how much they appreciated his
sensitivity.  They had been annoyed at seeing other high officials'
children lounging on the front seats in a manner which they regarded as
disrespectful.

Throughout China's history there was a tradition of officials' children
being arrogant and abusing their privileges.  This caused widespread
resentment.  Once a new guard in the compound did not recognize a
teenage girl who lived there and refused to let her in.  She screamed
at him and hit him with her satchel.  Some children talked to the
chefs, chauffeurs, and other staff in a rude and imperious manner. They
would call them by their names, which a younger person should never do
in China it is supremely disrespectful.  I will never forget the pained
look in the eyes of a chef in our canteen when the son of one of my
father's colleagues took some food back and said it was no good, and
shouted out his name.  The chef was deeply wounded, but said nothing. 
He did not want to displease the boy's father.  Some parents did
nothing about this kind of behavior by their children, but my father
was outraged.

Often he said: "These officials are no Communists."

My parents regarded it as very important that their children should be
brought up to be courteous and respectful to everyone.  We called the
service staff "Uncle' or "Aunt' So-and-so, which was the traditional
polite form for a child addressing an adult.  After we had finished our
meal, we always took the dirty bowls and chopsticks back to the
kitchen.  My father told us we should do this as a courtesy to the
chefs, as otherwise they would have to clear the tables themselves.
These small things earned us immense affection from the compound staff.
The chefs would keep food warm for us if we were late.  The gardeners
used to give me flowers or fruit.  And the chauffeur happily made
detours to pick me up and drop me home this was strictly behind my
father's back, as he would never let us use the car without him being
there.

Our modern apartment was on the third floor, and our balcony looked
down on a narrow alley of mud and cobbles outside the compound wall.
One side of the alley was the brick wall of the compound; the other was
a row of thin wooden one-story terraced houses, typical of poor
people's dwellings in Chengdu.  The houses had mud floors and no
toilets or running water.  Their facades were made out of vertical
planks, two of which served as the door.  The front room led directly
into another room, which led to another, and a row of several such
rooms formed the house.  The back room opened onto another street.
Since the side walls of the house were shared with neighbors, these
houses had no windows.  The inhabitants had to leave the doors at both
ends open to let in light or air.  Often, especially on hot summer
evenings, they would sit on the narrow pavement, reading, sewing, or
chatting.  From the pavement they could look straight up at the
spacious balconies of our apartments with their shiny glass windows. My
father said we must not offend the feelings of the people living in the
alley, and so he forbade us to play on the balcony.

On summer evenings, boys from the huts in the alley often used to walk
through the streets peddling anti mosquito incense.  They sang a
special tune to attract attention to their wares.  My evening reading
used to be punctuated by this lingering, sad tune.  Through my father's
constant reminding, I knew that being able to study undisturbed in a
big, cool room with a parquet floor and mosquito-netted open windows
was an enormous privilege.

"You must not think you are superior to them," he would say.

"You are just lucky to be here.  You know why we need communism?  So
that everyone can live in a good house like ours, and in much better
ones."

My father said things like this so often that I grew up feeling ashamed
of my privileges.  Sometimes boys from the compound would stand on
their balconies and mimic the tune the young peddlers sang.  I felt
ashamed when they did this.  When I went out with my father in his car,
I was always embarrassed when the car honked through the crowds.  If
people stared into the car, I would sink down in my seat and try to
avoid their gaze.

In my early teens I was a very serious girl.  I liked to be on my own,
thinking, often about moral issues that confused me.  I had become
rather lukewarm about games and fairgrounds and playing with other
children, and rarely gossiped with other girls.  Although I was
sociable and popular, there always seemed to be a certain distance
between me and the others.  In China people easily become familiar with
one another, particularly women.  But ever since I was a child, I have
always wanted to be left alone.

My father noticed this side of my character, and would comment on it
with approval.  While my teachers constantly said I should have more
'collective spirit," he told me that familiarity and living on top of
each other could be a destructive thing.  With this encouragement, I
kept my privacy and my space.  There are no exact words for these two
concepts in the Chinese language, but they were instinctively yearned
for by many, certainly by my siblings as well as me.  Jin-ming, for
instance, insisted so strongly on being allowed to lead his own life
that he was sometimes thought by those who did not know him to be
antisocial; in fact he was gregarious and extremely popular with his
peers.

My father often said to us, "I think it is marvelous that your mother
has this policy of "letting you roam free on the pasture."  Our parents
left us alone and respected our need to keep our separate worlds.

14.  "Father Is Close, Mother Is Close, but Neither Is as Close as
Chairman Mao' The Cult of Mao (1964-1965)

"Chairman Mao," as we always called him, began to impinge directly on
my life in 1964, when I was twelve.

Having been in retreat for some time after the famine, he was starting
his comeback, and in March of the previous year he had issued a call to
the whole country, particularly the young, to 'learn from Lei Feng."

Lei Feng was a soldier who, we were told, had died at the age of
twenty-two in 1962.  He had done an awful lot of good deeds going out
of his way a help the elderly, the sick, and the needy.  He had donated
his savings to disaster relief funds and given up his food rations to
comrades in the hospital.

Lei Feng soon began to dominate my life.  Every afternoon we left
school to 'do good deeds like Lei Feng."  We went down to the railway
station to try to help old ladies with their luggage, as Lei Feng had
done.  We sometimes had to grab their bundles from them forcibly
because some

340 '... but Neither Is as Close as Chairman Mao' countrywomen thought
we were thieves.  On rainy days, I stood on the street with an
umbrella, anxiously hoping that an old lady would pass by and give me
an opportunity to escort her home as Lei Feng had done.  If I saw
someone carrying water buckets on a shoulder pole old houses still did
not have running water t would try unsuccessfully to summon up the
courage to offer my help, although I had no idea how heavy a load of
water was.

Gradually, during the course of 1964, the emphasis began to shift from
boy scoutish good deeds to the cult of Mao.  The essence of Lei Feng,
the teachers told us, was his 'boundless love and devotion to Chairman
Mao."

Before he took any action, Lei Feng always thought of some words of
Mao's.  His diary was published and became our moral textbook.  On
almost every page there was a pledge like: "I must study Chairman Mao's
works, heed Chairman Mao's words, follow Chairman Mao's instructions,
and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao's."  We vowed to follow Lei Feng,
and be ready to 'go up mountains of knives and down seas of flames," to
'have our bodies smashed to powder and our bones crushed to
smithereens," to 'submit ourselves unquestioningly to the control of
the Great Leader' Mao.  The cult of Mao and the cult of Lei Feng were
two sides of the same coin: one was the cult of personality; the other,
its essential corollary, was the cult of impersonality.

I read my first article by Mao in 1964, at a time when two slogans of
Mao's - "Serve the People' and "Never Forget Class Struggle' dominated
our lives.  The essence of these two complementary slogans was
illustrated in Lei Feng's poem "The Four Seasons," which we all learned
by heart:

Like spring, I treat my comrades warmly.

Like summer, I am full of ardor for my revolutionary work.

The Cult of ,"rlao I eliminate my individualism as an autumn gale
sweeps away fallen leaves, And to the class enemy, I am cruel and
ruthless like harsh winter.

34~

In line with this, our teacher said we had to be careful whom we helped
on our do-good errands.  We must not help 'class enemies."  But I did
not understand who they were, and when I asked, neither the teachers
nor my parents were keen to elaborate.  One common answer was:

'like the baddies in the movies."  But I could not see anyone around me
who looked like the highly stylized enemy characters in the movies.
This posed a big problem.  I no longer felt sure about seizing bags
from old ladies.  I could not possibly ask, "Are you a class enemy?"

We sometimes went to clean the houses in an alley next to our school.
In one house there was a young man who used to lounge on a bamboo chair
watching us with a cynical smile as we toiled away on his windows.  Not
only did he not offer to help, he even wheeled his bicycle out of the
shed and suggested we clean that for him as well.

"What a pity," he once said, 'that you are not the real Lei Feng, and
that there are no photographers on hand to take your pictures for the
newspapers."  (Lei Feng's good deeds were miraculously recorded by an
official photographer.) We all hated the lounger with the dirty
bicycle.  Could he be a class enemy?  But we knew he worked at a
machinery factory, and workers, we had been repeatedly told, were the
best, the leading class in our revolution.  I was confused.

One of the things I had been doing was helping to push carts on the
streets after school.  The carts were often piled high with cement
blocks or chunks of sandstone.  They were terribly heavy, and every
step was an enormous effort for the men who pulled them.  Even in cold
weather, some would be bare-chested, and shiny beads of sweat trickled
down their faces and backs.  If the road was even slightly uphill, it
was very hard for some of them to keep going.

Whenever I saw them, I was attacked by a wave of sadness.

Since the campaign to learn from Lei Feng had started, I had stood by a
ramp waiting for carts to pass.  I would be exhausted after helping to
push just one of them.  As I left off, the man pulling would give me an
almost imperceptible sideways smile, trying not to break his stride and
lose momentum.

One day a classmate said to me in a very serious tone of voice that
most of the people pulling carts were class enemies who had been
assigned to do hard labor.  Therefore, she told me, it was wrong to
help them.  I asked my teacher, since I, in accordance with Chinese
tradition, always turned to teachers for authority.  But instead of her
normal air of confidence, she looked unsettled and said she did not
know the answer, which puzzled me.  In fact, it was actually true that
people pulling carts had often been assigned the job because they had
Kuomintang links, or because they were victims of one of the political
purges.

My teacher obviously did not want to tell me this, but she did ask me
to stop helping to push carts.  From then on, every time I happened on
a cart in the street, I averted my eyes from the bent figure trudging
along and quickly walked away with a heavy heart.

To fill us with hatred for class enemies, the schools started regular
sessions of 'recalling bitterness and reflecting on happiness," at
which older people would tell us about the miseries of pre-Communist
China.  Our generation had been born 'under the red flag' in new China,
and had no idea what life was like under the Kuomintang.

Lei Feng had, we were taught, which was why he could hate the class
enemies so deeply and love Chairman Mao with all his heart.  When he
was seven, his mother was supposed to have hanged herself after being
raped by a landlord.

Workers and peasants came to give talks at our school:

we heard of childhoods dominated by starvation, freezing winters with
no shoes, and premature, painful deaths.  They

told us how boundlessly grateful they were to Chairman Mao for saving
their lives and giving them food and clothing. One speaker was a member
of an ethnic group called the Yi, who had a system of slavery until the
late 195os.

He had been a slave and showed us scars from appalling beatings under
his previous masters.  Every time the speakers described the hardships
they had endured the packed hall was shaken by sobs.  I came out of
these sessions feeling devastated at what the Kuomintang had done, and
passionately devoted to Mao.

To show us what life without Mao would be like, every now and then the
school canteen cooked something called a 'bitterness meal," which was
supposed to be what poor people had to eat under the Kuomintang.  It
was composed of strange herbs, and I secretly wondered whether the
cooks were playing a practical joke on us it was truly unspeakable. The
first couple of times I vomited.

One day we were taken to an exhibition of 'class education' about
Tibet: on display were photos of dungeons crawling with scorpions, and
horrific instruments of torture, including a tool for scooping out eyes
and knives for cutting the tendons in the ankles.  A man in a
wheelchair who came to our school to give a talk told us he was a
former serf from Tibet who had had his ankle tendons severed for some
trivial offense.

Since 1964, large houses had also been opened as 'museums of class
education' to show how class enemies like landlords had lived in luxury
on the sweat and blood of the peasants before Mao came.  During the
holiday for Chinese New Year in 1965, my father took us to a famous
mansion two and a half hours' drive from home.  Underneath the
political justification, the journey was really an excuse for an outing
to the countryside in early spring, in accordance with the Chinese
tradition of 'walking on the tender green' (ta-qing) to welcome the
season.  This was one of the few occasions that my family ever went on
a trip out to the country.

As the car drove across the green Chengdu Plain along the
eucalyptus-lined asphalt road, I looked intently out of the window at
the lovely bamboo groves embracing the farmhouses, and the curving
smoke lingering above the thatched cottages peeping between the bamboo
leaves.

Occasionally, a branch of early plum blossom was reflected in the
streams that meandered around almost every thicket.

My father had asked us all to write an essay after the trip, describing
the scenery, and I observed everything with great care.  There was one
sight which puzzled me: the few trees dotted around the fields were
completely stripped of their branches and leaves except for the very
top, and looked like bare flagpoles with a cap of green.  My father
explained that firewood was scarce on the densely cultivated Chengdu
Plain, and that the peasants had cut off as many branches as they could
reach.  What he did not tell me was that there had been many more trees
until a few years before, but most of them had been cut down to feed
the furnaces to produce steel during the Great Leap Forward.

The countryside seemed extremely prosperous.  The market town where we
stopped for lunch was teeming with peasants in bright new clothes, the
older ones wearing shiny white turbans and clean dark-blue aprons.
Golden roast ducks glowed in the windows of the packed restaurants.
Deliciously scented clouds burst out of the lids of huge bamboo
steamers in the stalls on the crowded streets.  Our car crawled through
the market to the local government offices, which were in a mansion
with two stone lions squatting outside the gate.  My father had lived
in this county during the famine in 196I, and now, four years later,
the local officials wanted to show him how much had changed.  They took
us to a restaurant where a private room had been reserved for us.  As
we squeezed through the crowded restaurant the peasants stared at us,
obvious outsiders ushered in respectfully by the local bosses.  I saw
that the tables were covered with strange,

mouth-watering dishes.  I had hardly ever eaten anything except what we
were given in our canteen, and the food in this market town was full of
lovely surprises.  It had novel names too: "Pearl Balls,"

"Three Gunshots," "Lions' Heads."  Afterward the manager of the
restaurant said goodbye to us on the pavement while the local peasants
gawked at our entourage.

On the way to the museum, our car overtook an open truck with some boys
and girls from my school in it.  They were obviously going to the
'class-education' mansion as well.  One of my teachers was standing on
the back.  She smiled at me, and I shrank down in my seat with
embarrassment at the difference between our chauffeur-driven car and
the open truck on the bumpy road in the cold early spring air.  My
father was sitting in front with my youngest brother on his lap.  He
recognized my teacher and smiled back at her.  When he turned around to
attract my attention, he saw that I had completely disappeared.  He
beamed with pleasure.  My embarrassment showed my good qualities, he
said; it was good that I felt ashamed of privilege rather than
flaunting it.

I found the museum incredibly shocking.  There were sculptures of
landless peasants having to pay exorbitant rent.  One showed how the
landlord used two different measures: a big one for collecting grain
and a small one for lending it out at crippling interest, too.  There
were also a torture chamber and a dungeon with an iron cage sitting in
filthy water.  The cage was too small for a man to be able to stand up
straight, and too narrow for him to sit down.  We were told the
landlord used it to punish peasants who could not pay their rent.  One
room was said to have housed three wet-nurses who provided him with
human milk, which he believed was the most nutritious kind.  His
number-five concubine was said to have eaten thirty ducks a day not the
meat, only the feet, which were considered a great delicacy.

We were not told that the brother of this allegedly inhuman landlord
was now a minister in the government in Peking, having been given the
post as a reward for surrendering Chengdu to the Communists in 1949.

Throughout, while we were being instructed about the 'man-eating days
of the Kuomintang," we were reminded that we should be grateful to
Mao.

The cult of Mao went hand in hand with the manipulation of people's
unhappy memories of their past.  Class enemies were presented as
vicious malefactors who wanted to drag China back to the days of the
Kuomintang, which would mean that we children would lose our schools,
our winter shoes, and our food.  That was why we had to smash these
enemies, we were told.  Chiang Kai-shek was said to have launched
assaults on the mainland and tried to stage a comeback in 1962 during
the 'difficult period' the regime's euphemism for the famine.

In spite of all this talk and activity, class enemies for me, and for
much of my generation, remained abstract, unreal shadows.  They were a
thing of the past, too far away.  Mao had not been able to give them an
everyday material form.

One reason, paradoxically, was that he had smashed the past so
thoroughly.  However, the expectation of an enemy figure was planted in
us.

At the same time, Mao was sowing the seeds for his own deification, and
my contemporaries and I were immersed in this crude yet effective
indoctrination.  It worked partly because Mao adroitly occupied the
moral high ground: just as harshness to class enemies was presented as
loyalty to the people, so total submission to him was cloaked in a
deceptive appeal to be selfless.  It was very hard to get behind the
rhetoric, particularly when there was no alternative viewpoint from the
adult population.  In fact, the adults positively colluded in enhancing
Mao's cult.

For two thousand years China had an emperor figure who was state power
and spiritual authority rolled into one.

The religious feelings which people in other parts of the world have
toward a god have in China always been directed toward the emperor.  My
parents, like hundreds of millions of Chinese, were influenced by this
tradition.

Mao made himself more godlike by shrouding himself in mystery.  He
always appeared remote, beyond human approach.  He eschewed radio, and
there was no television.

Few people, except his court staff, ever had any contact with him. Even
his colleagues at the very top only met him in a sort of formal
audience.  After Yan'an, my father only set eyes on him a few times,
and then only at large-scale meetings.  My mother only ever saw him
once, when he came to Chengdu in 1958 and summoned all officials above
Grade I8 to have a group photo taken with him.

After the fiasco of the Great Leap Forward, he had disappeared almost
completely.

Mao, the emperor, fitted one of the patterns of Chinese history: the
leader of a nationwide peasant uprising who swept away a rotten dynasty
and became a wise new emperor exercising absolute authority.  And, in a
sense, Mao could be said to have earned his god-emperor status.

He was responsible for ending the civil war and bringing peace and
stability, which the Chinese always yearned for so much that they said
"It's better to be a dog in peacetime than a human being in war."  It
was under Mao that China became a power to be reckoned with in the
world, and many Chinese stopped feeling ashamed and humiliated at being
Chinese, which meant a tremendous amount to them.  In reality, Mao
turned China back to the days of the Middle Kingdom and, with the help
of the United States, to isolation from the world.  He enabled the
Chinese to feel great and superior again, by blinding them to the world
outside.  Nonetheless, national pride was so important to the Chinese
that much of the population was genuinely grateful to Mao, and did not
find the cult of his personality offensive, certainly not at first. The
near total lack of access to information and the systematic feeding of
disinformation meant that most Chinese had no way to discriminate
between Mao's successes and his failures, or to identi~ the relative
role of Mao and other leaders in the Communists' achievements.

Fear was never absent in the building up of Mao's cult.

Many people had been reduced to a state where they did not dare even to
think, in case their thoughts came out involuntarily.  Even if they did
entertain unorthodox ideas, few mentioned them to their children, as
they might blurt out something to other children, which could bring
disaster to themselves as well as their parents.  In the learn-from Lei
Feng years it was hammered into children that our first and only
loyalty should be to Mao.  A popular song went: "Father is close,
Mother is close, but neither is as close as Chairman Mao."  We were
drilled to think that anyone, including our parents, who was not
totally for Mao was our enemy.  Many parents encouraged their children
to grow up as conformists, as this would be safest for their future.

Self-censorship covered even basic information.  I never heard of
Yu-lin, or my grandmother's other relatives.  Nor was I told about my
mother's detention in 1955, or about the famine in fact, anything that
might sow a gram of doubt in me about the regime, or Mao.  My parents,
like virtually every parent in China, never said anything unorthodox to
their children.

In 1965, my New Year resolution was "I will obey my grandmother' - a
traditional Chinese way of promising to behave well.  My father shook
his head: "You should not say that.  You should only say "I obey
Chairman Mao."

On my thirteenth birthday, in March that year, my father's present was
not his usual books of science ficfon, but a volume containing the four
philosophical works of Mao.

Only one adult ever said anything to me which conflicted with the
official propaganda, and that was the stepmother of Deng Xiaoping, who
lived some of the time in the apartment block next to ours, with her
daughter, who worked in the provincial government.  She liked children,
and I was constantly in and out of her apariment.  When my friends and
I stole pickles from the canteen, or picked melon flowers and herbs
from the compound garden, we did not dare to take them home for fear of
being scolded, so we used to go to her apartment, where she would ~ash
and fry them for us.  This was all the more exciting because we were
eating something illicit.  She was about seven~ then but looked much
younger, with tiny feet and a gentle, smooth, but strong face.  She
always wore a gray cotton jacket and black cotton shoes, which she made
herself.  She was very relaxed and treated us like equals.  I liked
sitting in her kitchen chatting with her.  On one occasion, when I was
about thirteen, I went to see her straight after an emotional
'speak-bitterness' session.  I was bursting with compassion for anyone
who had had to live under the Kuomintang, and I said: "Grandma Deng,
how you must have suffered under the evil Kuomintang!  How the soldiers
must have looted you!  And the bloodsucking landlords!

What did they do to you?"

"Well," she answered, 'they didn't always loot ... and they were not
always evil .... Her words hit me like a bombshell.  I was so shocked
that I never told anyone what she had said.

At the time, none of us had any idea that the cult of Mao and the
emphasis on class struggle were part of Mao's plans for a showdown with
the president, Liu Shaoqi, and Deng Xiaoping, the general secretary of
the Party.  Mao was unhappy about what Liu and Deng were doing.  Since
the famine they had been liberalizing both the economy and the society.
To Mao, their approach smacked of capitalism rather than socialism. It
especially galled him that what he called 'the capitalist road' was
proving successful, while his chosen way, the 'correct' way, had turned
out to be a disaster.  As a practical man, Mao recognized this, and had
to allow them to have their way.  But he planned to impose his ideas
again as soon as the country was in good enough shape to stand the
experiment, and as soon as he could build-up enough momentum to
dislodge his powerful enemies in the Party.

35o '... but Neither Is as Close as Chairman Mao'

Mao found the idea of peaceful progress suffocating.  A restless
military leader, a warrior-poet, he needed action violent action and
regarded permanent human snuggle as necessary for social development.
His own Communists had become too tolerant and soft for his taste,
seeking to bring harmony rather than conflict.  There had been no
political campaigns, in which people fought each other, since 1959!

And Mao was sore.  He felt that his opponents had humiliated him by
showing him up as incompetent.  He had to take revenge, and, being
aware that his opponents had widespread support, he needed to increase
his authority hugely.  To achieve this, he needed to be deified.

Mao bided his time while the economy was recovering.

But as it improved, especially after 1964, he began to prepare the
grand opening of his confrontation.  The relative liberalization of the
early 1960s began to fade.

The weekly dances in the compound stopped in 1964.

So did the films from Hong Kong.  Out went my mother's fluffy bobs; in
came short, straight hair.  Her blouses and jackets were no longer
colorful or figure-hugging.  They were made of plain quiet colors and
looked like tubes.  I was particularly sorry to see her skirts go.  I
remembered how, a short time before, I had watched her getting off her
bicycle, gracefully lifting her blue-and-white check skirt with her
knee.  I was leaning against the mottled trunk of a plane tree that
formed part of the glade coveting the street outside the compound.  Her
skirt had been flowing like a fan as she rode toward me.  On summer
evenings, I had often pushed Xiao-fang there in his bamboo pram and
waited for her to come home.

My grandmother, now in her mid-fifties, kept more signs of her
femininity than my mother.  Although her jackets still in the
traditional style all became the same color of pale gray, she took
particular care of her long, thick black hair.  According to Chinese
tradition, which the Communists inherited, hair had to be well above
the shoulder for women of middle age, meaning over thirty.

My grandmother kept her hair tied up in a neat bun at the back of her
head, but she always had flowers there, sometimes a pair of
ivory-colored magnolias, and sometimes a white Cape jasmine cupped by
two dark-green leaves, which set off her lustrous hair.  She never used
shampoo from the shops, which she thought would make her hair dull and
dry, but would boil the fruit of the Chinese honey locust and use the
liquid from that.  She would rub the fruit to produce a perfumed
lather, and slowly let her mass of black hair drop into the shiny,
white, slithery liquid.  She soaked her wooden combs in the juice of
pomelo seeds, so that the comb ran smoothly through her hair, and gave
it a faint aroma.  She added a final touch by putting on a little water
of osmanthus flowers which she made herself, as perfume had begun to
disappear from the shops.  I remember watching her combing her hair. It
was the only thing over which she took her time.  She did everything
else very swiftly.  She would also paint her eyebrows lightly with a
black charcoal pencil and dab a little powder on her nose.  Remembering
her eyes smiling into the mirror with a particular kind of intense
concentration, I think these must have been among her most pleasurable
moments.

Watching her doing her face was strange, even though I had been
watching her do it since I was a baby.  The women in books and films
who made themselves up now were invariably wicked characters, like
concubines.  I vaguely knew something about my beloved grandmother
having been a concubine, but I was learning to live with contradictory
thoughts and realities, and getting used to compartmentalizing them.
When I went out shopping with my grandmother, I began to realize that
she was different from other people, with her makeup, no matter how
discreet, and the flowers in her hair.  People noticed her.

She walked proudly, her figure erect, with a restrained
self-consciousness.

She could get away with it because she lived in the compound.  If she
had been living outside, she would have fallen under one of the
residents' committees, which supervised the lives of any adult who did
not have a job and so did not belong to a work unit.  The committees
usually contained retired men and old housewives, and some of them
became notorious for minding other people's business and throwing their
weight around.  Had my grandmother been under one of these, she would
have received disapproving hints or open criticism.  But the compound
had no committee.  She did have to go to a meeting once a week with
other parents-in-law and maids and nannies from the compound, to be
told about Party policies, but she was mainly left alone.  Actually,
she enjoyed the meetings; they were a chance to chat with the other
women and she always came home beaming with the latest gossip.

Politics invaded my life more and more after I went to middle school in
the autumn of 1964.  On our first day we were told we should thank
Chairman Mao for being there, because his 'class line' had been applied
to our year's enrollment.  Mao had accused schools and universities of
having taken in too many children of the bourgeoisie.  Now, he had
instructed, priority should be given to sons and daughters of 'good
backgrounds' (chu-shen hao).  This meant having workers, peasants,
soldiers, or Party officials as parents, particularly as fathers.  The
application of this 'class-line' criterion to the whole society meant
that one's lot was more than ever determined by one's family and the
accident of birth.

However, the status of a family was often ambiguous: a worker might
once have been employed in a Kuomintang office; a clerk did not belong
to any category; an intellectual was an 'undesirable," but what if he
was a Party member?

How should the children of such parents be classified?

Many enrollment officers decided to play it safe, which meant giving
preference to children whose parents were Party officials.  They
constituted half the pupils in my class.

My new school, the Number Four Middle School, was the leading key
school for the whole province and took students with the highest marks
in the all-Sichuan entrance exams.  In previous years, entrance had
been decided solely on the basis of exam results.  In my year, exam
marks and family background were equally important.

In the two exam papers, I got 100 percent for math and an unusual 100
percent 'plus' for Chinese.  My father had constantly drummed it into
me that I should not rely on my parents' name, and I did not like the
suggestion that the 'class line' had helped me get into the school. But
I soon thought no more about it.  If this was what Chairman Mao said,
it must be good.

It was in this period that 'high officials' children' (gaogan zi-dO
became almost a stratum of their own.  They developed an air which
identified them unmistakably as members of an elite group, exuding an
awareness of powerful backing and untouchability.  Many high officials'
children now grew more arrogant and haughty than ever, and from Mao
downward concern was constantly being expressed about their behavior.
It became a recurrent theme in the press.  All this only reinforced the
idea that they were a special group.

My father frequently warned us against this air and against forming
cliques with other children of high officials.  The result was that I
had few friends, as I seldom met children from any other background.
When I did come into contact with them, I found we had been so
conditioned by the importance of family background and the lack of
shared experience that we seemed to have little in common with each
other.

When I entered the new school two teachers came to see my parents to
ask which foreign language they wanted me to learn.  They chose English
rather than Russian, which was the only other option.  The teachers
also wanted to know whether I was going to take physics or chemistry in
my first year.  My parents said they would leave that up to the
school.

I loved the school from the moment I walked in.  It had an imposing
gate with a broad roof of blue tiles and carved caves.  A flight of
stone stairs led up to it, and the loggia was supported by six
red-timber columns.  Symmetrical rows of dark-green cypresses enhanced
the atmosphere of solemnity leading into the interior.

The school had been founded in 14 18 BC.  It was the first school set
up by a local government in China.  At its center was a magnificent
temple, formerly dedicated to Confucius.  It was well preserved, but
was not functioning as a temple any longer.  Inside were half a dozen
ping-pong tables, separated by the massive columns.  In front of the
carved doors, down a long flight of stairs, lay extensive grounds
designed to provide a majestic approach to the temple.  A two-story
teaching block had been erected, which cut off the grounds from a brook
crossed by three little arched bridges, with sculptures of miniature
lions and other animals sitting on their sandstone edges.  Beyond the
bridges was a beautiful garden surrounded by peaches and plane trees.
Two giant bronze incense burners were set at the bottom of the stairs
in front of the temple, although there was no longer any blue smoke
curling up and lingering in the air above them.  The grounds on the
sides of the temple had been converted into basketball and volleyball
courts.  Farther along were two lawns where we used to sit or lie in
spring and enjoy the sun during lunch breaks.

Behind the temple was another lawn, beyond which lay a big orchard at
the foot of a small hill covered with trees, vines, and herbs.

Dotted around were laboratories where we studied biology and chemistry,
learned to use microscopes, and dissected dead animals.  In the lecture
theaters, we watched teaching films.  For after-school activities, I
joined the biology group which strolled around the hill and the back
garden with the teacher learning the names and characteristics of the
different plants.  There were temperaturecontrolled breeding cases for
us to observe how tadpoles and ducklings broke out of their eggs.  In
spring, the school was a sea of pink because of all the peach trees.
But what I liked most was the two-story library, built in the
traditional Chinese style.  The building was encircled on both floors
by loggias, and the outside of these was enclosed by a row of
gorgeously painted seats which were shaped like wings.

I had a favorite corner in these 'wing seats' (fei-lai-yO where I used
to sit for hours reading, occasionally stretching my arm out to touch
the fan-shaped leaves of a rare ginkgo tree.  There was a pair of them
outside the front gate of the library, towering and elegant.  They were
the only sight that could distract me from my books.

My clearest memory is of my teachers.  They were the best in their
field; many were grade one, or special grade.

Their classes were sheer joy, and I could never have enough of them.

But more and more political indoctrination was creeping into school
life.  Gradually, morning assembly became devoted to Mao's teachings,
and special sessions were instituted in which we read Party documents.
Our Chineselanguage textbook now contained more propaganda and less
classical literature, and politics, which mainly consisted of works by
Mao, became part of' the curriculum.

Almost every activity became politicized.  One day at morning assembly
the headmaster told us we were going to do eye exercises.  He said
Chairman Mao had observed that there were too many schoolchildren
wearing spectacles, a sign that they had hurt their eyes by working too
hard.  He had ordered something to be done about it.  We were all
terribly moved by his concern.  Some of us wept with gratitude.  We
started doing eye exercises for fifteen minutes every morning.  A set
of movements had been devised by doctors and set to music.  After
rubbing various points around our eyes, we all stared intently at the
rows of poplars and willows outside the window.  Green was supposed to
be a restful color.  As I enjoyed the comfort the exercises and the
leaves brought me, I thought of Mao and repledged my loyalty to him.

A repeated theme was that we must not allow China to 'change color,"
which meant going from Communist to capitalist.  The split between
China and the Soviet Union, which had been kept secret at first, had
burst into the open in early 1963.  We were told that since Khrushchev
had come to power after the death of Stalin in 1953 the Soviet Union
had surrendered to international capitalism, and that Russian children
had been reduced to suffering and misery again, just like Chinese
children under the Kuomintang.  One day, after warning us for the
umpteenth time against the road taken by Russia, our politics teacher
said: "If you aren't careful, our country will change color gradually,
first from bright red to faded red, then to gray, then to black."  It
so happened that the Sichuan expression 'faded red' had exactly the
same pronunciation (er-hong) as my name.

My classmates giggled, and I could see them stealing glances at me.  I
felt I must get rid of my name immediately.  That evening I begged my
father to give me another name.  He suggested Zhang, meaning both
'prose' and 'coming into one's own early," which expressed his desire
for me to become a good writer at a young age.

But I did not want the name.  I told my father that I wanted 'something
with a military ring to it."  Many of my friends had changed their
names to incorporate the characters meaning 'army' or 'soldier."  My
father's choice reflected his classical learning.  My new name, Jung
(pronounced "Yung'), was a very old and recondite word for 'martial
affairs' which appeared only in classical poetry and a few antiquated
phrases.  It evoked an image of bygone battles between knights in
shining armor, with tasseled spears and neighing steeds.  When I turned
up at school with my new name even some teachers could not recognize
the character $1.

At this time Mao had called on the country to go from learning from Lei
Feng to learning from the army.  Under the defense minister, Lin Biao,
who had succeeded Marshal Peng Dehuai in 1959, the army had become the
trailblazer for the cult of Mao.  Mao also wanted to regimentalize the
nation even more.  He had just written a well-publicized poem exhorting
women to 'doff feminini~ and don military attire."  We were told that
the Americans were waiting for a chance to invade and reinstate the
Kuomintang, and that in order to defeat an invasion by them Lei Feng
had trained day and night to overcome his weak physique and become a
champion hand-grenade thrower.

Physical training suddenly assumed vital importance.

There was compulsory running, swimming, high jumping, working out on
parallel bars, shot-punning, and throwing wooden hand grenades.  In
addition to the two hours of sports per week, forty-five minutes of
after-school sports now became obligatory.

I had always been hopeless at sports, and hated them, except tennis.
Previously this had not mannered, but now it took on a political
connotation, with slogans like: "Build up a strong physique to defend
our motherland."  Unfortunately, my aversion to sports was increased by
this pressure.  When I tried to swim, I always had a mental picture of
being pursued by invading Americans to the bank of a surging river.  As
I could not swim, my only choice was between being drowned or being
captured and tortured by the Americans.  Fear gave me frequent cramps
in the water, and once I thought I was drowning in the swimming pool.

In spite of compulsory swimming every week during the summer, I never
managed to learn to swim all the time I lived in China.

Hand-grenade throwing was also regarded as very important, for obvious
reasons.  I was always at the bottom of the class.  I could only throw
the wooden hand grenades we practised with a couple of yards.  I felt
that my classmates were questioning my resolve to fight the US

imperialists.  Once at our weekly political meeting somebody commented
on my persistent failure at hand-grenade throwing.  I could feel the
eyes of the class boring into me like needles, as if to say: "You are a
lackey of the Americans!"  The next morning I went and stood in a
corner of the sports field, with my arms held out in front of me and a
couple of bricks in each hand.  In Lei Feng's diary, which I had
learned by heart, I had read that this was how he had toughened up his
muscles to throw hand grenades.

After a few days, by which time my upper arms were red and swollen, I
gave up, and whenever I was handed the wooden chunk, I became so
nervous that my hands shook uncontrollably.

One day in 1965, we were suddenly told to go out and start removing all
the grass from the lawns.  Mao had instructed that grass, flowers, and
pets were bourgeois habits and were to be eliminated.  The grass in the
lawns at our school was of a type I have not seen anywhere outside
China.  Its name in Chinese means 'bound to the ground."  It crawls all
over the hard surface of the earth and spreads thousands of roots which
drill down into the soil like claws of steel.  Underground they open up
and produce further roots which shoot out in every direction.

In no time there are two networks, one aboveground and one below ground
which intertwine and cling to the earth, like knotted metal wires that
have been nailed into the ground.  Often the only casualties were my
fingers, which always ended up with deep, long cuts.  It was only when
they were attacked with hoes and spades that some of the root systems
went, reluctantly.  But any fragment left behind would make a
triumphant comeback after even a slight rise in temperature or a gentle
drizzle, and we would have to go into battle all over again.

Flowers were much easier to deal with, but they went with even more
difficulty, because no one wanted to remove them.  Mao had attacked
flowers and grass several times before, saying that they should be
replaced by cab

The Cult q lao 35~;

bales and cotton.  But only now was he able to generate enough pressure
to get his order implemented but only~ up to a point.  People loved
their plants, and some flowerbeds survived Mao's campaign.

I was extremely sad to see the lovely plants go.  But I did not resent
Mao.  On the contrary, I hated myself for feeling miserable.  By then I
had grown into the habit of self criticism and automatically blamed
myself for any instincts that went against Mao's instructions.  In
fact, such feelings frightened me.  It was out of the question to
discuss them with anyone.  Instead, I tried to suppress them and
acquire the correct way of thinking.  I lived in a state of constant
self-accusation.

Such self-examination and self-criticism were a feature of Mao's China.
You would become a new and better person, we were told.  But all this
introspection was really designed to serve no other purpose than to
create a people who had no thoughts of their own.

The religious aspect of the Mao cult would not have been possible in a
traditionally secular society like China had there not been impressive
economic achievements.

The country had made a stunning recovery from the famine, and the
standard of living was improving dramatically.  In Chengdu, although
rice was still rationed, there was plenty of meat, poultry, and
vegetables.  Winter melons, turnips, and eggplants were piled up on the
pavements outside the shops because there was not enough space to store
them.  They were left outside overnight, and almost nobody took them;
the shops were giving them away for a pittance.  Eggs, once so
precious, sat rotting in large baskets there were too many of them.
Only a few years before it had been hard to find a single peach now
peach eating was being promoted as 'patriotic," and officials went
around to people's homes and tried to persuade them to take peaches for
next to nothing.

There were a number of success stories which boosted the nation's
pride.  In October 1964 China exploded its first atomic bomb.  This was
given huge publicity and touted as a demonstration of the country's
scientific and industrial achievement, particularly in relation to
'standing up to imperialist bullies."  The explosion of the atomic bomb
coincided with the ousting of Khrushchev, which was presented as proof
that Mao was right again.  In 1964 France recognized China at full
ambassadorial level, the first leading Western nation to do so.  This
was received with rapture inside China as a major victory over the
United States, which was refusing to acknowledge China's rightful place
in the world.

In addition, there was no general political persecution, and people
were relatively content.  All the credit was given to Mao.  Although
the very top leaders knew what Mao's real contribution was, the people
were kept completely in the dark.  Over the years I composed passionate
eulogies thanking Mao for all his achievements and pledging my undying
loyalty to him.

I was thirteen in 1965.  On the evening of I October that year, the
sixteenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, there
was a big fireworks display on the square in the center of Chengdu.  To
the north of the square was the gate to an ancient imperial palace,
which had recently been restored to its third-century grandeur, when
Chengdu was the capital of a kingdom and a prosperous warlord city. 
The gate was very similar to the Gate of Heavenly Peace in Peking, now
the entrance to the Forbidden City, except for its color: it had
sweeping green tiled roofs and gray walls.  Under the glazed roof of
the pavilion stood enormous dark-red pillars.  The balustrades were
made of white marble.  I was standing behind them with my family and
the Sichuan dignitaries on a reviewing stand enjoying the festival
atmosphere and waiting for the fireworks to begin.  Below in the square
50,000 people were singing and dancing.  Bang.  t Bang.t The signals
for the fireworks went off a few yards from where I stood.  In an
instant, the sky was a garden of spectacular shapes and

The Cult of Mao 36I colors, a sea of wave after wave of brilliance. The
music and noise rose from below the imperial gate to join in the
sumptuousness.  After a while, the sky was clear for a few seconds.
Then a sudden explosion brought out a gorgeous blossom, followed by the
unfurling of a long, vast, silky hanging.  It stretched itself in the
middle of the sky, swaying gently in the autumn breeze.  In the light
over the square, the characters on the hanging were shining: "Long Live
Our Great Leader Chairman Mao!"  Tears sprang to my eyes.

"How lucky, how incredibly lucky I am to be living in the great era of
Mao Zedong!"  I kept saying to myself.

"How can children in the capitalist world go on living without being
near Chairman Mao, and without the hope of ever seeing him in person?"
I wanted to do something for them, to rescue them from their plight.  I
made a pledge to myself there and then to work hard to build a stronger
China, in order to support a world revolution.  I needed to work hard
to be entitled to see Chairman Mao, too.  That was the purpose of my
life.

15.  "Destroy First, and

Construction Will

Look After Itself'-The Cultural Revolution Begins

(1965-1966)

At the beginning of the 1960s, in spite of all the disasters Mao had
caused, he was still China's supreme leader, idololized by the
population.  But because the pragmatists were actually running the
country, there was relative literary and artistic freedom.  A host of
plays, operas, films, and novels emerged after long hibernation.  None
attacked the Party openly, and contemporary themes were rare.  At this
time Mao was on the defensive, and he turned more and more to his wife,
Jiang Qjng, who had been an actress in the 193OS.  They decided that
historical themes were being used to convey insinuations against the
regime and against Mao himself.

In China, there was a strong tradition of using historical allusion to
voice opposition, and even apparently esoteric allusions were widely
understood as coded references to the present day.  In April 1963 Mao
banned all "Ghost Dramas," a genre rich in ancient tales of revenge by
dead victims' spirits on those who had persecuted them.  To him, these
ghost avengers were uncomfortably close to the class enemies who had
perished under his rule.

The Maos also turned their attention to another genre, the "Dramas of
the Ming Mandarin," the protagonist of which was Hai Rui, a mandarin
from the Ming dynasty (1368-1644).  A famous personification of justice
and courage, the Ming Mandarin remonstrated with the emperor on behalf
of the suffering ordinary people, at the risk of his own life.  He was
dismissed and exiled.  The Maos suspected that the Ming Mandarin was
being used to represent Marshal Peng Dehuai, the former defense
minister who in 1959 had spoken out against Mao's disastrous policies
which had caused the famine.  Almost immediately after Peng's
dismissal, there was a noticeable resurgence of the Ming Mandarin
genre.  Mme Mao tried to get the plays denounced, but when she
approached the writers and ministers in charge of the arts they turned
a deaf ear.

In 1964, Mao drew up a list of thirty-nine artists, writers, and
scholars for denunciation.  He branded them 'reactionary bourgeois
authorities," a new category of class enemies.

Prominent names on the list included the most famous playwright in the
Ming Mandarin genre, Wu Han, and Professor Ma Yin-chu, who had been the
first leading economist to advocate birth control.  For this he had
already been named a rightist in 1957.  Mao had subsequently realized
that birth control was necessary, but he resented Professor Ma for
showing him up and making it clear that he was wrong.

The list was not made public, and the thirty-nine people were not
purged by their Party organizations.  Mao had the list circulated to
officials down to my mother's level with instructions to catch other
'reactionary bourgeois authorities."  In the winter of 1964-65, my
mother was sent as the head of a work team to a school named "Ox
Market."

She was told to look for suspects among prominent

teachers and those who had written books or articles.

My mother was appalled, particularly as the purge threatened the very
people she most admired.  Besides, she could plainly see that even if
she were to look for 'enemies' she would not find any.  Apart from
anything else, with the memory of all the recent persecutions few had
dared to open their mouths at all.  She told her superior, Mr.  Pao,
who was in charge of the campaign in Chengdu, how she felt.

Nineteen sixty-five passed, and my mother did nothing.

Mr.  Pao did not exert any pressure on her.  Their inaction reflected
the general mood among Party officials.  Most of them were fed up with
persecutions, and wanted to get on with improving living standards and
building a normal life.

But they did not openly oppose Mao, and indeed went on promoting his
personality cult.  The few who watched Mao's deification with
apprehension knew there was nothing they could do to stop it: Mao had
such power and prestige that his cult was irresistible.  The most they
could do was engage in some kind of passive resistance.

Mao interpreted the reaction from the Party officials to his call for a
witch-hunt as an indication that their loyalty to him was weakening and
that their hearts were with the policies being pursued by President Liu
and Deng.  His suspicion was confirmed when the Party newspapers
refused to publish an article he had authorized denouncing Wu Han and
his play about the Ming Mandarin.  Mao's purpose in getting the article
published was to involve the population in the witch-hunt.  Now he
found he was cut off from his subjects by the Party system, which had
been the intermediary between himself and the people.  He had, in
effect, lost control.  The Party Committee of Peking, where Wu Han was
deputy mayor, and the Central Department of Public Affairs, which
looked after the media and the arts, stood up to Mao, refusing either
to denounce Wu Han or to dismiss him.

Mao felt threatened.  He saw himself as a Stalin figure,

about to be denounced by a Khrushchev while he was still alive.  He
wanted to make a preemptive strike and destro~ the man he regarded as
"China's Khrushchev," Liu Shaoqi, and his colleague Deng, as well as
their followers in the Party.  This he deceptively termed the "Cultural
Revolution."  He knew his would be a lone battle, but this gave him the
majestic satisfaction of feeling that he was challenging nothing less
than the whole world, and maneuvering on a grand scale.  There was even
a tinge of self-pity as he portrayed himself as the tragic hero taking
on a mighty enemy the huge Party machine.

On io November ,965, having repeatedly failed to have the article
condemning Wu Han's play published in Peking, Mao was at last able to
get it printed in Shanghai, where his followers were in charge.  It was
in this article that the term "Cultural Revolution' first appeared. The
Party's own newspaper, the People's Daily, refused to reprint the
article, as did the Peking Daily, the voice of the Party organization
in the capital.  In the provinces, some papers did carry the article.
At the time, my father was overseeing the provincial Party newspaper,
the Sichuan Daily, and was against reprinting the article, which he
could sense was an attack on Marshal Peng and a call for a witch-hunt.
He went to see the man in charge of cultural affairs for the province,
who suggested they telephone Deng Xiaoping.  Deng was not in his
office, and the call was taken by Marshal Ho Lung, a close friend of
Deng's, and a member of the Politburo.  It was he whom my father had
overheard saying in 1959: "It really should be him [Deng] on the
throne."  Ho said not to reprint the article.

Sichuan was one of the last provinces to run the article, doing so only
on 18 December, well after the People's Daily finally printed it on 30
November.  The article appeared in the People's Daily only after Zhou
Enlai, the premier, who had emerged as the peacekeeper in the power
struggle, added a note to it, in the name of 'the editor," saying that
the Cultural Revolution was to be an 'academic' discussion,

meaning that it should be nonpolitical and should not lead to political
condemnations.

Over the next three months there was intense maneuvering, with Mao's
opponents, as well as Zhou, trying to head off Mao's witch-hunt.  In
February 1966, while Mao was away from Peking, the Politburo passed a
resolution that 'academic discussions' must not degenerate into
persecutions.  Mao had objected to this resolution, but he was
ignored.

In April my father was asked to prepare a document in the spirit of the
Politburo's February resolution to guide the Cultural Revolution in
Sichuan.  What he wrote became known as the "April Document."  It said:
The debates must be strictly academic.  No wild accusations should be
allowed.  Everyone is equal before the truth.  The Party must not use
force to suppress intellectuals.

Just as this document was about to be published in May, it was suddenly
blocked.  There was a new Politburo decision.  This time, Mao had been
present and had got the upper hand, with Zhou Enlai's complicity.  Mao
tore up the February resolution and declared that all dissident
scholars and their ideas must be 'eliminated."  He emphasized that it
was officials in the Communist Party who had been protecting the
dissident scholars and other class enemies.  He termed these officials
'those in power following the capitalist road," and declared war on
them.  They became known as 'capitalist-roaders."  The mammoth Cultural
Revolution was formally launched.

Who exactly were these 'capitalist-roaders'?  Mao himself was not sure.
He knew he wanted to replace the whole of the Peking Party Committee,
which he did.  He also knew he wanted to get rid of Liu Shaoqi and Deng
Xiaoping, and 'the bourgeois headquarters in the Party."  But he did
not know who in the vast Party system were loyal to him and who were
followers of Liu and Deng and their 'capitalist road."  He calculated
that he controlled only a third of the Party.  In order not to let a
single one of his enemies escape, he resolved to overthrow the entire
Communist Party.  Those faithful to him would survive the upheaval.  In
his own words: "Destroy first, and construction will look after
itself."  Mao was not worried about the possible destruction of the
Party: Mao the Emperor always overrode Mao the Communist.  Nor was he
fainthearted about hurting anyone unduly, even those most loyal to
him.

One of his great heroes, the ancient general Tsao Tsao, had spoken an
immortal line which Mao openly admired:

"I would rather wrong all people under Heaven; and no one under Heaven
must ever wrong me."  The general proclaimed this when he discovered
that he had murdered an elderly couple by mistake the old man and
woman, whom he had suspected of betraying him, had in fact saved his
life.

Mao's vague bat He calls threw the population and the majority of Party
officials into profound confusion.  Few knew what he was driving at, or
who exactly were the enemies this time.  My father and mother, like
other senior Party people, could see that Mao had decided to punish
some officials.  But they had no idea who these would be.  It could
well be themselves.  Apprehension and bewilderment overwhelmed them.

Meanwhile, Mao made his single most important organizational move: he
set up his own personal chain of command that operated outside the
Party apparatus, although by formally claiming it was under the
Politburo and the Central Committee he was able to pretend it was
acting on Party orders.

First, he picked as his deputy Marshal Lin Biao, who had succeeded Peng
Dehuai as defense minister in 1959 and had greatly boosted Mao's
personality cult in the armed forces.  He also set up a new body, the
Cultural Revolution Authority, under his former secretary Chen Boda,
with his intelligence chief Kang Sheng and Mme Mao as its de facto
leaders.  It became the core of the leadership of the Cultural
Revolution.

368 "Destroy First, and Construction Will Look After Itself'

Next, Mao moved in on the media, primarily the People's Daily, which
carried the most authority as it was the official Party newspaper and
the population had become accustomed to it being the voice of the
regime.  He appointed Chen Boda to take it over on 3I May, thus
securing a channel through which he could speak directly to hundreds of
millions of Chinese.

Starting in June 1966, the People's Daily showered the country with one
strident editorial after another, calling for 'establishing Chairman
Mao's absolute authority," 'sweeping away all the ox devils and snake
demons' (class enemies), and exhorting people to follow Mao and join
the vast, unprecedented undertaking of a Cultural Revolution.

In my school, teaching stopped completely from the beginning of June,
though we had to continue to go there.

Loudspeakers blasted out People's Daily editorials, and the front page
of the newspaper, which we had to study every day, was frequently taken
up entirely by a full-page portrait of Mao.  There was a daily column
of Mao's quotations.  I still remember the slogans in bold type, which,
through reading in class over and over again, were engraved into the
deepest folds of my brain: "Chairman Mao is the red sun in our
hearts!"

"Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline!"

"We will smash whoever opposes Chairman Mao!"

"People all over the world love our Great Leader Chairman Mao!"

There were pages of worshipping comments from foreigners, and pictures
of European crowds trying to grab Mao's works.  Chinese national pride
was being mobilized to enhance his cult.

The daily newspaper reading soon gave way to the recitation and
memorizing of The Quotations of Chairman Mao, which were collected
together in a pocket-size book with a red plastic cover, known as "The
Little Red Book."  Everyone was given a copy and told to cherish it
'like our eyes."

Every day we chanted passages from it over and over again in unison.  I
still remember many verbatim.

One day, we read in the People's Daily that an old peasant had stuck
thirty-two portraits of Mao on his bedroom walls, 'so that he can see
Chairman Mao's face as soon as he opens his eyes, whatever direction he
looks in."  So we covered the walls of our classroom with pictures of
Mao's face beaming his most benign smile.  But we soon had to take them
down, and quickly, too.  Word circulated that the peasant had really
used the pictures as wallpaper, because Mao's portraits were printed on
the best-quality paper and were free.  Rumour had it that the reporter
who had written up the story had been found to be a class enemy for
advocaring 'abuse of Chairman Mao."  For the first time, fear of
Chairman Mao entered my subconscious.

Like "Ox Market," my school had a work team stationed in it.  The team
had hal heartedly branded several of the school's best teachers as
'reactionary bourgeois authorities," but had kept this from the pupils.
In June 1966, however, panicked at the tide of the" Cultur:,l
Revolution and feeling the need to create some victims, the work team
suddenly announced the names of the accused to the whole school.

The work team organized pupils and the teachers who had not been
accused to write denunciation posters and slogans, which soon covered
the grounds.  Teachers became active for a variety of reasons:
conformity, loyalty to the Party's orders, envy of the prestige and
privileges of other teachers and fear.

Among the victims was my Chinese language and literature teacher, Mr.
Chi, whom I adored.  According to one of the wall posters, he had said
in the early 1960s: "Shouting "Long live the Great Leap Forward!"  will
not fill our stomachs, will it?"  Having no idea that the Great Leap
had caused the famine, I did not understand his alleged remark,
although I could catch its irreverent tone.

There was something about Mr.  Chi which set him apart.

At the time I could not put my finger on it, but now I think it was
that he had an air of irony about him.  He had a way of making dry,
short half-cough, half-laughs which suggested he had kept something
unsaid.  He once made this noise in response to a ques6 on I asked him.
One lesson in our textbook was an extract from the memoirs of Lu
Dingyi, the then head of Central Public Affairs, about his experience
on the Long March.  Mr.  Chi drew our attention to a vivid description
of the troops marching along a zigzagging mountain path, the whole
procession lit up by pine torches carried by the marchers, the flames
glowing against a moonless black sky.  When they reached their night's
destination, they all 'rushed to grab a bowlful of food to pour down
their stomachs."  This puzzled me profoundly, as Red Army soldiers had
always been described as offering their last mouthful to their comrades
and going starving themselves.  It was impossible to imagine them
'grabbing."  I went to Mr.  Chi for an answer.  He cough laughed said I
did not know what being hungry meant, and quickly changed the subject.
I was unconvinced.

In spite of this, I felt the greatest respect for Mr.  Chi.  It broke
my heart to see him, and other teachers I admired, being wildly
condemned and called ugly names.  I hated it when the work team asked
everyone in the school to write wall posters 'exposing and denouncing'
them.

I was fourteen at the time, instincfvely averse to all militant
activities, and I did not know what to write.  I was frightened of the
wall posters' overwhelming black ink on giant white sheets of paper,
and the outlandish and violent language, such as "Smash So-and-so's
dog's head' and "Annihilate So-and-so if he does not surrender."  I
began to play truant and stay at home.  For this I was constantly
criticized for 'putting family first' at the endless meetings that now
made up almost our entire school life.  I dreaded these meetings.  A
sense of unpredictable danger haunted me.

One day my deputy headmaster, Mr.  Kan, a jolly, energetic man, was
accused of being a capitalist-roader and of protecting the condemned
teachers.  Everything he had done in the school over the years was said
to be 'capitalist,"

The Cultural Revolution Begins 37 i even studying Mao's works as fewer
hours had been devoted to this than to academic studies.

I was equally shocked to see the cheerful secretary of the Communist
Youth League in the school, Mr.  Shan, being accused of being
'anti-Chairman Mao."  He was a dashing-looking young man whose
attention I had been eager to attract, as he might help me join the
Youth League when I reached the minimum age, fifteen.

He had been teaching a course on Marxist philosophy to the sixteen- to
eighteen-year-olds, and had given them some essay-writing assignments.
He had underlined bits of the essays which he thought were particularly
well written.  Now these disconnected parts were joined together by his
pupils to form an obviously nonsensical passage which the wall posters
claimed was anti-Mao.  I learned years later that this method of
concocting an accusation through the arbitrary linking of unconnected
sentences had started as early as 1955, the year my mother suffered her
first detention under the Communists, when some writers had used it to
attack their fellow writers.

Mr.  Shan told me years later that the real reason he and the deputy
headmaster were picked out as victims was that they were not around at
the time they had been absent as members of another work team which
made them convenient scapegoats.  The fact that they did not get on
with the headmaster, who had stayed behind, made things worse.

"If we'd been there and he'd been away, that son of a turtle wouldn't
have been able to pull his pants up, he would have had so much shit on
his arse," Mr.  Shan told me ruefully.

The deputy headmaster, Mr.  Kan, had been devoted to the Party, and
felt terribly wronged.  One evening he wrote a suicide note and then
slashed his throat with a razor.  He was rushed to hospital by his
wife, who had come home earlier than usual.  The work team hushed up
his suicide attempt.  For a Party member like Mr.  Kan to commit
suicide was regarded as a betrayal.  It was seen as a loss of faith in
the Party and an attempt at blackmail.  Therefore, no mercy should be
shown to the unfortunate person.  But the work team was nervous.  They
knew very well that they had been inventing victims without the
slightest justification.

When my mother was told about Mr.  Kan she cried.  She liked him very
much, and knew that as he was a man of immense optimism he must have
been under inhuman pressure to have acted in this way.

In her own school, my mother refused to be swept into any panic
victimizing.  But the teenagers in the school, stirred up by the
articles in the People's Daily, began to move against their teachers.
The People's Daily called for 'smashing up' the examination system
which 'treated pupils like enemies' (quoting Mao) and was part of the
vicious designs of the 'bourgeois intellectuals," meaning the majority
of the teachers (again quoting Mao).  The paper also denounced
'bourgeois intellectuals' for poisoning the minds of the young with
capitalist rubbish in preparation for a Kuomintang comeback.

"We cannot allow bourgeois intellectuals to dominate our schools
anymore!"  said Mao.

One day my mother bicycled to the school to find that the pupils had
rounded up the headmaster, the academic supervisor, the graded
teachers, whom they understood from the official press to be
'reactionary bourgeois authorities," and any other teachers they
disliked.  They had shut them all up in a classroom and put a notice on
the door saying 'demons' class."  The teachers had let them do it
because the Cultural Revolution had thrown them into bewilderment.  The
pupils now seemed to have some sort of authorization, undefined but
nonetheless real.  The grounds were covered with giant slogans, mostly
headlines from the People's Daily.

As my mother was shown to the classroom now turned 'prison," she passed
through a crowd of pupils.  Some looked fierce, some ashamed, some
worried, and others uncertain.  More pupils had been following her from
the moment she arrived.  As the leader of the work team, she had
supreme authority, and was identified with the Part)'.

The pupils looked to her for orders.  Having set up the 'prison," they
had no idea what to do next.

My mother announced forcefully that the 'demons' class' was dismissed.
There was a stir among the pupils, but nobody challenged her order.  A
few boys muttered to one another, but lapsed into silence when my
mother asked them to speak out.  She went on to tell them that it was
illegal to detain anyone without authorization, and that they should
not ill-treat their teachers, who deserved their gratitude and respect.
The door to the classroom was opened and the 'prisoners' set free.

My mother was very brave to go against the tide.  Many other work teams
engaged in victimizing completely innocent people to save their own
skins.  In fact, she had more cause than most to worry.  The provincial
authorities had already punished several scapegoats, and my father had
a strong presentiment that he was going to be the next in line.  A
couple of his colleagues had told him discreetly that the word was
going around in some organizations under him that they should turn
their suspicion on him.

My parents never said anything to me or my siblings.

The restraints which had kept them silent about politics before still
prevented them from opening their minds to us.  Now it was even less
possible for them to speak.  The situation was so complex and confusing
that they could not understand it themselves.  What could they possibly
say to us that would make us understand?  And what use would it have
been anyway?  There was nothing anyone could do.

What was more, knowledge itself was dangerous.  As a result, my
siblings and I were totally unprepared for the Cultural Revolution,
although we had a vague feeling of impending catastrophe.

In this atmosphere, August came.  All of a sudden, like a storm
sweeping across China, millions of Red Guards emerged.

16.  "Soar to Heaven, and Pierce the Earth'~

Mao's Red Guards June-August 1966)

Under Mao a generation of teenagers grew up expecting to fight class
enemies, and the vague calls in the press for a Cultural Revolution had
stoked the feeling that a 'war' was imminent.  Some politically
well-attuned youngsters sensed that their idol, Mao, was directly
involved, and their indoctrination gave them no alternative but to take
his side.

By the beginning of June a few activists from a middle school attached
to one of China's most renowned universities, qmghua in Peking, had got
together several times to discuss their strategies for the forthcoming
battle and had decided to call themselves 'the Red Guards of Chairman
Mao."  They adopted a quotation by Mao that had appeared in the
People's Daily, "Rebellion is justified," as their motto.

These early Red Guards were 'high officials' children."

Only they could feel sufficiently secure to engage in activities of
this kind.  In addition, they had been brought up in a political
environment, and were more interested in political intrigues than most
Chinese.  Mme Mao noticed them, and gave them an audience in July.  On
x August, Mao made the unusual gesture of writing them an open letter
to offer his 'most warm and fiery support."  In the letter he subtly
modified his earlier saying to "Rebellion against reactionaries is
justified."  To the teenage zealots, this was like being addressed by
God.  After this, Red Guard groups sprang up all over Peking, and then
throughout China.

Mao wanted the Red Guards to be his shock troops.  He could see that
the people were not responding to his repeated calls to attack the
capitalist-roaders.  The Communist Party had a sizable constituency,
and, moreover, the lesson of 1957 was also still fresh in people's
minds.

Then, too, Mao had called on the population to criticize Party
officials, but those who had taken up his invitation had ended up being
labeled as rightists and had been damned.  Most people suspected the
same tactic again 'enticing the snake out of its haunt in order to cut
off its head."

If he was to get the population to act, Mao would have to remove
authority from the Party and establish absolute loyalty and obedience
to himself alone.  To achieve this he needed terror an intense terror
that would block all other considerations and crush all other fears. He
saw boys and girls in their teens and early twenties as his ideal
agents.

They had been brought up in the fanatical personality cult of Mao and
the militant doctrine of' class struggle."  They were endowed with the
qualities of youth- they were rebellious, fearless, eager to fight for
a 'just cause," thirsty for adventure and action.  They were also
irresponsible, ignorant, and easy to manipulate and prone to violence.
Only they could give Mao the immense force that he needed to terrorize
the whole society, and to create a chaos that would shake, and then
shatter, the foundation of the Party.  One slogan summed up the Red
Guards' mission: "We vow to launch a bloody war against anyone who
dares to resist the Cultural Revolution, who dares to oppose Chairman
Mao!"

All policies and orders had hitherto been conveyed through a tightly
controlled system which was entirely in

376 "Soar to Heaven, and Pierce the Earth' the hands of the Party.  Mao
now discarded this channel and turned directly to the masses of the
youth.  He did this by combining two quite different methods: vague,
high flown rhetoric carried openly in the press; and conspirao to rial
manipulation and agitation conducted by the Cultural Revolution
Authority, particularly his wife.  It was they who filled out the real
meaning of the rhetoric.  Phrases like 'rebellion against authority,"
'revolution in education," 'destroying an old world so a new one could
be born," and 'creating new man' all of which attracted many in the
West in the 1960s were interpreted as calls for violent action.  Mao
understood the latent violence of the young, and said that since they
were well fed and had had their lessons stopped, they could easily be
stirred up and use their boundless energy to go out and wreak havoc.

To arouse the young to controlled mob violence, victims were necessary.
The most conspicuous targets in any school were the teachers, some of
whom had already been victimized by work teams and school authorities
in the last few months.  Now the rebellious children set upon them.

Teachers were better targets than parents, who could only have been
attacked in an atomized and isolated manner.

They were also more important figures of authority than parents in
Chinese culture.  In practically every school in

China, teachers were abused and beaten, sometimes fatally.  Some
schoolchildren set up prisons in which teachers were tortured.

But this was not enough on its own to generate the kind of terror that
Mao wanted.  On i8 August, a mammoth rally was held in Tiananmen Square
in the center of

Peking, with over a million young participants.  Lin Biao appeared in
public as Mao's deputy and spokesman for the first time.  He made a
speech calling on the Red Guards to charge out of their schools and
'smash up the four olds' defined as 'old ideas, old culture, old
customs, and old habits."

Following this obscure call, Red Guards all over China took to the
streets, giving full vent to their vandalism, ignorance, and
fanaticism.  They raided people's houses, smashed their antiques, tore
up paintings and works of calligraphy.  Bonfires were lit to consume
books.  Very soon nearly all treasures in private collections were
destroyed.

Many writers and artists committed suicide after being cruelly beaten
and humiliated, and being forced to witness their work being burned to
ashes.  Museums were raided.

Palaces, temples, ancient tombs, statues, pagodas, city walls anything
'old' was pillaged.  The few things that survived, such as the
Forbidden City, did so only because Premier Zhou Enlai sent the army to
guard them, and issued specific orders that they should be protected.
The Red Guards only pressed on when they were encouraged.

Mao hailed the Red Guards' actions as "Very good indeed!"  and ordered
the nation to support them.

He encouraged the Red Guards to pick on a wider range of victims in
order to increase the terror.  Prominent writers, artists, scholars,
and most other top professionals, who had been privileged under the
Communist regime, were now categorically condemned as 'reactionary
bourgeois authorities."  With the help of some of these people's
colleagues who hated them for various reasons, ranging from fanaticism
to envy, the Red Guards began to abuse them.  Then there were the old
'class enemies': former landlords and capitalists, people with
Kuomintang connections, those condemned in previous political campaigns
like the 'rightists' and their children.

Quite a number of' class enemies' had not been executed or sent to
labor camps, but had been kept 'under surveillance."  Before the
Cultural Revolution, the police were allowed to release information
about them only to authorized personnel.  Now that policy changed.  The
police chief, one of Mao's own liege men Xie Fuzhi, ordered his men to
offer the 'class enemies' to the Red Guards, and to tell the Red Guards
about their crimes, such as their 'intention to overthrow the Communist
government."

Up till the beginning of the Cultural Revolution torture, as distinct
from torment, had been forbidden.  Now Xie ordered policemen 'not to be
bound by the old rules, no matter if they had been set by the police
authoriues or by the state."  After saying "I'm not in favor of beating
people to death," he continued: "But if some fRed Guards] hate the
class enemies so much that they want to kill them, you don't have to
force them to stop."

A wave of beating and torture swept the country, mainly during house
raids.  Almost invariably, the families would be ordered to kneel on
the floor and kowtow to the Red Guards; they were then beaten with the
brass buckles of the Guards' leather belts.  They were kicked around,
and one side of their head was shaved, a humiliating style called the
'yin and yang head," because it resembled the classic Chinese symbol of
a dark side (yin) and a light side (yang).

Most of their possessions were either smashed or taken away.

It was worst in Peking, where the Cultural Revolution

Authority was on hand to incite the young people.  In the city center
some theaters and cinemas were turned into torture chambers.  Victims
were dragged in from all over

Peking.  Pedestrians avoided the spots because the streets around
echoed with the screams of the victims.

The earliest Red Guard groups were made up of high officials' children.
Soon, when more people from other backgrounds joined, some of the high
officials' children managed to keep their own special groups, like the
"Pickets."  Mao and his camarilla took a number of steps calculated to
increase their sense of power.  At the second mass

Red Guards rally, Lin Biao wore their arm band to signify that he was
one of them.  Mme Mao made them the guards of honor in front of the
Gate of Heavenly Peace in Tiananmen Square on National Day, 1 October.
As a result, some of them developed an outrageous 'theory of the
bloodline," summed up in the words of a song: "The son of a hero father
is always a great man; a reactionary father produces nothing but a
bastard!"  Armed with this 'theory," some high officials' children
tyrannized and even tortured children from 'undesirable' backgrounds.

Mao let all this happen in order to generate the terror and chaos he
wanted.  He was not scrupulous about either who was hit or who were the
agents of violence.  These early victims were not his real targets, and
Mao did not particularly like or trust his young Red Guards.  He was
simply using them.  For their part, the vandals and torturers were not
always devoted to Mao.  They were just having a wild time, having been
licensed to indulge their worst instincts.

Only a small proportion of the Red Guards was actually involved in
cruelty or violence.  Many were able to avoid taking part because the
Red Guard was a loose organization which, by and large, did not
physically force its members to do evil.  As a matter of fact, Mao
himself never ordered the Red Guards to kill, and his instructions
regarding violence were contradictory.  One could feel devoted to Mao
without perpetrating violence or evil.

Those who chose to do so could not simply blame Mao.

But Mao's insidious encouragement of atrocities was undeniable.  On 18
August, at the first of the eight gigantic rallies which altogether
were attended by thirteen million people, he asked a female Red Guard
what her name was.

When she answered "Bin-bin," which means 'gentle," he said
disapprovingly, "Be violent' (yao-wu-ma).  Mao rarely spoke in public,
and this remark, well publicized, was naturally followed like the
gospel.  At the third mammoth rally, on x5 September, when the Red
Guards' atrocities were reaching their zenith, Mao's recognized
spokesman, Lin Biao, announced, with Mao standing next to him: "Red
Guard fighters: The direction of your battles has always been correct.
You have soundly, heartily battered the capitalist-roaders, the
reactionary bourgeois authorities, the bloodsuckers and parasites.  You
have done the right thing!

And you have done marvelously!"  At that, hysterical cheers,

deafening screams of "Long live Chairman Mao," uncontrollable tears,
and howled pledges of loyalty took possession of the crowds filling the
enormous Tiananmen Square.  Mao waved paternally, generating more
frenzy.

Through his Cultural Revolution Authority, Mao kept control over the
Peking Red Guards.  He then sent them to the provinces to tell the
local young people what to do.  In Jinzhou, in Manchuria, my
grandmother's brother Yu-lin and his wife were beaten up, and they and
their two children were exiled to a barren part of the country.  Yu-lin
had come under suspicion when the Communists first arrived, because of
his possession of a Kuomintang intelligence card, but nothing had
happened to him or his family until now.  My family did not know about
this at the time.

People avoided exchanging news.  With accusations so willfully
concocted, and the consequences so horrific, you never knew what
catastrophe you might bring to your correspondents, or they to you.

People in Sichuan had little idea of the extent of the terror in
Peking.  There were fewer atrocities in Sichuan, partly because the Red
Guards there were not directly incited by the Cultural Revolution
Authority.  In addition, the police in Sichuan turned a deaf ear to
their minister in Peking, Mr.  Xie, and refused to offer up the 'class
enemies' under their control to the Red Guards.  However, the Red
Guards in Sichuan, as in other provinces, copied the actions of those
in Peking.  There was the same kind of chaos as everywhere in China
controlled chaos.  The Red Guards may have looted the houses which they
were authorized to raid, but they rarely stole from shops.  Most
sectors, including commerce, the postal services and transport, worked
normally.

In my school, a Red Guard organization was formed on z6 August, with
the help of some Red Guards from Peking.

I had been staying at home feigning illness to escape the political
meetings and frightening slogans, and was unaware that the organization
had been set up until a

Mao's Red Guards 38I couple of days later, when a phone call summoned
me back 'to participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."
When I got to the school, I noticed that many pupils were proudly
wearing red armbands with gold characters saying "Red Guards."

In these early days, the newborn Red Guards had the immense prestige of
being Mao's babies.  It went without saying that I should join, and I
immediately submitted my application to the Red Guard leader in my form
a fifteen-year-old boy named Geng who had been constantly seeking my
company, but became shy and gauche the moment he was with me.

I could not help wondering how Geng had become a Red Guard, and he was
mysterious about his activities.  But it was very clear to me that the
Red Guards were mostly high officials' children.  The head of the
school Red Guards was one of the sons of Commissar Li, the Party first
secretary for Sichuan.  I ought to have been a natural;

few pupils had fathers in higher positions than mine.  But Geng
privately told me that I was considered soft and 'too inactive," and
must be toughened up before they could consider accepting me.

Since June, there had been an unwritten rule that everyone should
remain in school around-the-clock to devote themselves entirely to the
Cultural Revolution.  I was one of the few who did not.  But now the
thought of playing truant somehow gave me a sense of danger, and I felt
compelled to stay.  The boys slept in the classrooms so we girls could
occupy the dormitories.  Non-Red Guards were attached to Red Guard
groups and taken with them on their various activities.

The day after I returned to school, I was taken out with several dozen
other children to change street names to make them more
'revolutionary."  The street where I lived was called Commerce Street,.
and we debated what it should be renamed.  Some proposed "Beacon Road,"
to signify the role of our provincial Party leaders.  Others said

"Public Servants' Street," as that was what officials should be,
according to a quote of Mao's.  Eventually we left without settling on
anything because a preliminary problem could not be solved: the name
plate was too high up on the wall to reach.  As far as I knew, no one
ever went back.

In Peking the Red Guards were much more zealous.  We heard about their
successes: the British mission was now on "Anti-Imperialism Road," the
Russian embassy on "Anti-Revisionism Road."

In Chengdu, streets were shedding their old names like "Five
Generations under One Roof' (a Confucian virtue), "The Poplar and
Willow Are Green' (green was not a revolutionary color), and "Jade
Dragon' (a symbol of feudal power).  They became "Destroy the Old,"

"The East Is Red," and "Revolution' streets.  A famous restaurant
called "The Fragrance of Sweet Wind' had its plaque broken to bits.

It was renamed "The Whiff of Gunpowder."

Traffic was in confusion for several days.  For red to mean 'stop' was
considered impossibly counterrevolutionary.  It should of course mean
'go."  And traffic should not keep to the right, as was the practice,
it should be on the left.  For a few days we ordered the traffic
policemen aside and controlled the traffic ourselves.  I was stationed
at a street corner telling cyclists to ride on the left.  In Chengdu
there were not many cars or traffic lights, but at the few big
crossroads there was chaos.  In the end, the old rules reasserted
themselves, owing to Zhou Enlai, who managed to convince the Peking Red
Guard leaders.  But the youngsters found justifications for this: I was
told by a Red Guard in my school that in Britain traffic kept to the
left, so ours had to keep to the right to show our anti-imperialist
spirit.  She did not mention America.

As a child I had always shied away from collective activity.  Now, at
fourteen, I felt even more averse to it.  I suppressed this dread
because of the constant sense of guilt I had come to feel, through my
education, when I was out of step with Mao.  I kept telling myself that
I must train my thoughts according to the new revolutionary theories
and practices.  If there was anything I did not understand, I must
reform myself and adapt.  However, I found myself trying very hard to
avoid militant acts such as stopping passersby and cutting their long
hair, or narrow trouser legs, or skirts, or breaking their
semi-high-heeled shoes.

These things had now become signs of bourgeois decadence, according to
the Peking Red Guards.

My own hair came to the critical attention of my schoolmates.  I had to
have it cut to the level of my earlobes.

Secretly, though much ashamed of myself for being so 'petty bourgeois,"
I shed tears over losing my long plaits.

As a young child, my nurse had a way of doing my hair which made it
stand up on top of my head like a willow branch.  She called it
'fireworks shooting up to the sky."

Until the early 1960s I wore my hair in two coils, with rings of little
silk flowers wound around them.  In the mornings, while I hurried
through my breakfast, my grandmother or our maid would be doing my hair
with loving hands.  Of all the colors for the silk flowers, my favorite
was pink.

After 1964, following Mao's calls for an austere lifestyle, more suited
to the atmosphere of class struggle, I put patches on my trousers to
try to look 'proletarian' and wore my hair in the uniform style of two
plaits with no colors, but long hair had not been condemned as yet.  My
grandmother cut it for me, muttering all the while.  Her hair survived,
because she never went out at that time.

The famous teahouses in Chengdu also came under attack as 'decadent." I
did not understand why, but did not ask.  In the summer of 1966 I
learned to suppress my sense of reason.  Most Chinese had been doing
that for a long time.

A Sichuan teahouse is a unique place.  It usually sits in the embrace
of a bamboo grove or under the canopy of a large tree.  Around the low,
square wooden tables are bamboo armchairs which give out a faint aroma
even after years of use.  To prepare the tea a pinch of tea leaves is
dropped into a cup and boiling water is poured on top.

Then a lid is sunk loosely onto the cup, allowing the steam to seep
through the gap, bringing out the fragrance of the jasmine or other
blossoms.  Sichuan has many kinds of tea.

Jasmine alone has five grades.

Teahouses are as important to the Sichuanese as pubs are to the
British.  Older men, in particular, spend a lot of time there, puffing
their long-stemmed pipes over a cup of tea and a plateful of nuts and
melon seeds.  The waiter shuttles between the seats with a kettle of
hot water which he pours from a couple of feet away with pinpoint
accuracy.

A skillful waiter makes the water level higher than the edge of the cup
without it spilling over.  As a child I was always mesmerized watching
the water fall from the spout.  I was rarely taken to a teahouse,
though.  It had an air of indulgence of which my parents disapproved.

Like European cafes, a Sichuan teahouse provides newspapers on bamboo
frames.  Some customers go there to read, but it is primarily a place
to meet and chat, exchanging news and gossip.  There is often
entertainment storytelling punctuated with wooden clappers.

Perhaps because they had an aura of leisure, and if people were sitting
in one they were not out making revolution, teahouses had to be closed.
I went with a couple of dozen pupils between thirteen and sixteen years
old, most of whom were Red Guards, to a small one on the bank of the
Silk River.  Chairs and tables were spread outside under a Chinese
scholar tree.  The summer evening breeze from the river fanned out a
heavy scent from the clusters of white blossoms.  The customers, mostly
men, raised their heads from their chessboards as we approached along
the uneven cobblestones that paved the bank.  We stopped under the
tree.  A few voices from our group started to shout: "Pack up!  Pack
up!  Don't linger in this bourgeois place!"  A boy from my form
snatched a corner of the paper chessboard on the nearest table and
jerked it away.  The wooden pieces scattered on the ground.

The men who had been playing were quite young.  One of them lunged
forward, his fists clenched, but his friend quickly pulled the corner
of his jacket.  Silently they began to pick up the chess pieces.  The
boy who had jerked away their board shouted: "No more chess playing! 
Don't you know it is a bourgeois habit?"  He stooped to sweep up a
handful of pieces and threw them toward the river.

I had been brought up to be courteous and respectful to anyone older
than me, but now to be revolutionary meant being aggressive and
militant.  Gentleness was considered 'bourgeois."  I was repeatedly
criticized for it, and it was one reason given for not allowing me into
the Red Guards.

Over the years of the Cultural Revolution, I was to witness people
being attacked for saying 'thank you' too often, which was branded as
'bourgeois hypocrisy'; courtesy was on the brink of extinction.

But now, outside the teahouse, I could see that most of us, including
the Red Guards, were uneasy about the new style of speaking and lording
it over others.  Not many of us opened our mouths.  Quietly, a few
started to paste rectangular slogans onto the walls of the teahouse and
the tnmk of the scholar tree.

The customers silently began to walk away along the bank.  Watching
their disappearing figures, a feeling of loss overwhelmed me.  A couple
of months before, these adults probably would have told us to get lost.
But now they knew that Mao's backing had given the Red Guards power.

Thinking back, I can see the thrill some children must have felt at
demonstrating their power over adults.  A popular Red Guard slogan
went: "We can soar to heaven, and pierce the earth, because our Great
Leader Chairman Mao is our supreme commander!"  As this declaration
reveals, the Red Guards were not enjoying genuine freedom of
self-expression.  From the start they were nothing but the tool of a
tyrant.

Standing on the riverbank in August 1966, though, I was just confused.
I went into the teahouse with my fellow pupils.  Some asked the manager
to close down.  Others started pasting slogans on the walls.  Many
customers were getting up to go, but in a far corner one old man was
still sitting at his table, calmly sipping his tea.  I stood beside
him, feeling embarrassed that I was supposed to assume the voice of
authority.  He looked at me, and resumed his noisy sipping.  He had a
deeply lined face that was almost stereotypical 'working class' as
shown in propaganda pictures.  His hands reminded me of one of my
textbook stories which described the hands of an old peasant: they
could bundle thorny firewood without feeling any pain.

Perhaps this old man was very sure of his unquestionable background, or
his advanced age, which had hitherto been the object of respect, or
perhaps he simply did not think I was very impressive.  Anyway, he
remained in his seat taking no notice of me.  I summoned up my courage
and pleaded in a low voice, "Please, could you leave?"  Without looking
at me, he said, "Where to?"

"Home, of course," I replied.  He turned to face me.  There was emotion
in his voice, though he spoke quietly.

"Home?  What home?  I share a tiny room with my two grandsons.  I have
a corner surrounded by a bamboo curtain.  Just for the bed.  That's
all.  When the kids are home I come here for some peace and quiet.  Why
do you have to take this away from me?"

His words filled me with shock and shame.  This was the first time I
had heard a firsthand account of such miserable living conditions.  I
turned and walked away.

This teahouse, like all the others in Sichuan, was shut for fifteen
years until 198x, when Deng Xiaoping's reforms decreed it could be
reopened.  In 1985 I went back there with a British friend.  We sat
under the scholar tree.

An old waitress came to fill our cups with a kettle from two feet away.
Around us, people were playing chess.  It was one of the happiest
moments of that trip back.

When Lin Biao called for everything that represented the old culture to
be destroyed, some pupils in my school started to smash things up.
Being more than 2,000 years old, the school had a lot of antiques and
was therefore a prime site for action.  The school gateway had an old
tiled roof with carved eaves.  These were hammered to pieces.

The same happened to the sweeping blue-glazed roof of the big temple
which had been used as a ping-pong hall.

The pair of giant bronze incense burners in front of the temple were
toppled, and some boys urinated into them.

In the back garden, pupils with big hammers and iron rods went along
the sandstone bridges casually breaking the little statues.  On one
side of the sports field was a pair of towering rectangular tablets
made of red sandstone, each twenty feet high.  Some lines about
Confucius were carved on them in beautiful calligraphy.  A huge rope
was tied around them, and two gangs pulled.  It took them a couple of
days, as the foundations were deep.  They had to get some workers from
outside to dig a hole around the tablets.

When the monuments finally crashed down amidst cheers, they lifted part
of the path that ran behind them.

All the things I loved were disappearing.  The saddest thing of all for
me was the ransacking of the library: the golden filed roof, the
delicately sculpted windows, the blue painted chairs .... Bookshelves
were turned upside down, and some pupils tore books to pieces just for
the hell of it.

Afterward, X-shaped white paper strips with black characters were stuck
on what was left of the doors and windows to signal that the building
was sealed.

Books were major targets of Mao's order to destroy.

Because they had not been written within the last few months, and
therefore did not quote Mao on every page, some Red Guards declared
that they were all 'poisonous weeds."  With the exception of Marxist
classics and the works of Stalin, Mao, and the late Lu Xun, whose name
Mme Mao was using for her personal vendettas, books were burning all
across China.  The country lost most of its written heritage.  Many of
the books which survived later went into people's stoves as fuel.

But there was no bonfire at my school.  The head of the school Red
Guards had been a very conscientious student.

A rather feminine-looking seventeen-year-old, he had been made the Red
Guard leader because his father was the Party chief for the province,
rather than because of his own ambition.  While he could not prevent
the general vandalism, he did manage to stop the books from being
burned.

Like everyone else, I was supposed to join in the 'revolutionary
actions."  But I, like most pupils, was able to avoid them, because the
destruction was not organized, and no one made sure we took part.  I
could see that many pupils hated the whole thing, but nobody tried to
stop it.  Like myself, many boys and girls may well have been telling
themselves that they were wrong to feel sorry about the destruction and
needed to reform.  But subconsciously we all knew we would have been
crushed instantly had we raised any objection.

By then 'denunciation meetings' were becoming a major feature of the
Cultural Revolution.  They involved a hysterical crowd and were seldom
without physical brutality.

Peking University had taken the lead, under the personal supervision of
Mao.  At its first denunciation meeting, on i8 June, over sixty
professors and heads of depariments, including the chancellor, were
beaten, kicked, and forced to kneel for hours.  Dunce caps with
humiliating slogans were forced onto their heads.  Ink was poured over
their faces to make them black, the color of evil, and slogans were
pasted all over their bodies.  Two students gripped the arms of each
victim, twisting them around behind his back and pushing them up with
such ferocity as almost to dislocate them.  This posture was called the
'jet plane," and soon became a feature of most denunciation meetings
all over the country.

I was once called by the Red Guards in my form to attend such a
meeting.  Horror made me feel very chilly in the hot summer afternoon
when I saw a dozen or so teachers standing on the platform on the
sports ground, with their heads bent and their arms twisted into the
'jet plane' position.  Then, some were kicked on the back of their
knees and forced to kneel, while others, including my English-language
teacher, an elderly man with the fine manner of a classical gentleman,
were forced to stand on long, narrow benches.  He found it hard to keep
his balance, and swayed and fell, cutting his forehead on the sharp
corner of a bench.  A Red Guard standing next to him instinctively
stooped and extended his hands to help, but immediately straightened up
and assumed an exaggeratedly harsh posture, with his fists clenched,
yelling: "Get back onto the bench!"  He did not want to be seen as soft
on a 'class enemy."  Blood trickled down the teacher's forehead and
coagulated on the side of his face.

He, like the other teachers, was accused of all sorts of outlandish
crimes; but they were really there because they were graded, and
therefore the best, or because some pupils had grudges against them.

I learned in later years that the pupils in my school behaved
relatively mildly because, being in the most prestigious school, they
were successful and academically inclined.  In the schools which took
in wilder boys, there were teachers who were beaten to death.  I
witnessed only one beating in my school.  My philosophy teacher had
been somewhat dismissive to those who had not done well in her classes,
and some of them hated her and now started to accuse her of being
'decadent."  The 'evidence," which reflected the extreme conservatism
of the Cultural Revolution, was that she had met her husband on a bus.
They got to chatting, and fell in love.  Love arising out of a chance
meeting was regarded as a sign of immorality.  The boys took her to an
office and 'took revolutionary actions over her' the euphemism for
beating somebody up.  Before they started, they called for me
especially and made me

39 "Soar to Heaven, and Pierce the Earth' attend.

"What will she think when she sees you, her pet pupil, there!"

I was considered her favorite because she had praised my work often.
But I was also told that I should be there because I had been too soft,
and needed 'a lesson in revolution."

When the beating started, I shrank at the back of the ring of pupils
who crowded into the small office.  A couple of classmates nudged me to
go to the front and join in the hitting.  I ignored them.  In the
center my teacher was being kicked around, rolling in agony on the
floor, her hair askew.

As she cried out, begging them to stop, the boys who had set upon her
said in cold voices, "Now you beg!  Haven't you been ferocious?  Now
beg properly!"  They kicked her again, and ordered her to kowtow to
them and say "Please spare my life, masters!"  To make someone kowtow
and beg was an extreme humiliation.  She sat up and stared blankly
ahead: I met her eyes through her knotted hair.  In them I saw agony,
desperation, and emptiness.  She was gasping for breath, and her face
was ashen gray.  I sneaked out of the room.  Several pupils followed
me.  Behind us I could hear people shouting slogans, but their voices
were tentative and uncertain.  Many pupils must have been scared.  I
walked away swiftly, my heart pounding.  I was afraid I might be caught
and beaten myself.  But no one came after me, and I was not condemned
afterward.

I did not get into trouble in those days, in spite of my obvious lack
of enthusiasm.  Apart from the fact that the Red Guards were loosely
organized, I was, according to the 'theory of bloodlines," born bright
red, because my father was a high official.  Although I was disapproved
of, nobody did anything drastic, except criticize me.

At the time, the Red Guards divided pupils into three categories:
'reds," 'blacks," and 'grays."  The 'reds' were from the families of
'workers, peasants, revolutionary officials, revolutionary officers,
and revolutionary martyrs."

The 'blacks' were those with parents classified as 'land

lords, rich peasants, counterrevolution ari bad elements, and
rightists."  The 'grays' came from ambiguous families such as shop
assistants and clerks.  In my year, all pupils ought to have been
'reds' because of the screening in the enrollment.  But the pressure of
the Cultural Revolution meant that some villains had to be found.  As a
result, more than a dozen became 'grays' or 'blacks."

There was a girl named Ai-ling in my year.  We were old friends, and I
had often been to her house and knew her family well.  Her grandfather
had been a prominent economist, and her family had been enjoying a very
privileged life under the Communists.  Their house was large, elegant,
and luxurious, with an exquisite garden much better than my family's
apartment.  I was especially attracted by their collection of antiques,
in particular the snuff bottles which Ai-ling's grandfather had brought
back from England where he had studied at Oxford in the

19~0S.

Now, suddenly, Ai-ling became a 'black."  I heard that pupils from her
form had raided her house, smashed all the antiques, including the
snuff bottles, and beaten her parents and grandfather with the brass
buckles of their belts.  The next day when I saw her she was wearing a
scarf.  Her classmates had given her a 'yin and yang head."

She had had to have it completely shaved.  She wept with me.  I felt
terribly inadequate because I could not find any words to comfort
her.

In my own form a meeting was organized by the Red Guards at which we
all had to give our family backgrounds so we could be categorized.  I
announced 'revolutionary official' with great relief.  Three or four
pupils said 'office staff."  In the jargon of the day, this was
different from 'officials," who held more senior positions.  The
division was unclear, as there was no definition of what 'senior'
meant.  Nevertheless, these vague labels had to be used on various
forms, all of which had a space for 'family background."  Together with
a girl whose father was a shop assistant, the children of 'office
staff' were branded as 'grays."  It was announced that they were to be
kept under surveillance, sweep the school grounds and clean toilets,
bow their heads at all times, and be prepared to be lectured by any Red
Guard who cared to address them.  They also had to report their
thoughts and behavior every day.

These pupils suddenly looked subdued and shrunken.

Their vigor and enthusiasm, which they had had in abundance up to now,
had deserted them.  One gift bent her head and tears streamed down her
cheeks.  We had been friends.

After the meeting I went over to her to say something comforting, but
when she raised her head I saw resentment, almost hatred, in her eyes.
I walked away without a word, and wandered listlessly through the
grounds.  It was the end of August.  The Cape jasmine bushes spread
their rich fragrance.  It seemed strange there should be any scent at
all.

As dusk was descending I was walking back to the dormitory when I saw
something flash by a second-floor window of a classroom block about
forty yards away.  There was a muffled bang at the foot of the
building.  The hazy branches of some orange trees prevented me from
seeing what was happening, but people started to run in the direction
of the noise.  Out of the confused, suppressed exclamations I made out
the message: "Someone has jumped out of the window!"

I instinctively raised my hands to cover my eyes, and ran to my room. I
was terribly scared.  My mind's eye fixated on the blurry crooked
figure in midair.  Hurriedly I shut the windows, but the noise of
people talking nervously about what had happened filtered through the
thin glass.

A seventeen-year-old girl had attempted suicide.  Before the Cultural
Revolution, she had been one of the leaders of the Communist Youth
League, and had been a model in studying Chairman Mao's works and
learning from Lei Feng.  She had done many good deeds like washing her
comrades' clothes and cleaning out toilets, and frequently gave talks
to the school about how loyally she followed Mao's teachings.  She was
often to be seen strolling deep in conversation with a fellow pupil,
with a conscientious and purposeful look on her face, carrying out
'heart-to heart duties with someone who wanted to join the Youth
League.  But now, suddenly, she had been categorized as a 'black."  Her
father was 'office staff."  He worked for the municipal government, and
was a Party member.  But some of her classmates who found her a 'pain,"
and whose fathers were in higher posts, decided she should be a
'black."  In the last couple of days, she had been put under guard with
other 'blacks' and 'grays' and forced to pull grass out of the sports
ground.  To humiliate her, her classmates had shaved her beautiful
black hair, leaving her head grotesquely bald.  On that evening, the
'reds' in her form had been giving her and the other victims an
insulting lecture.

She retorted that she was more loyal to Chairman Mao than they were.
The 'reds' slapped her and told her she was not fit to talk about her
loyalty to Mao because she was a class enemy.  She ran to the window
and threw herself out.

Stunned and scared, the Red Guards rushed her to a hospital.  She did
not die, but she was crippled for life.

When I saw her many months later on the street, she was bent over on
crutches, her eyes blank.

On the night of her attempted suicide, I could not sleep.

The moment I closed my eyes, an indistinct figure loomed over me,
smeared with blood.  I was terrified and shaking.

The next day I asked for sick leave, which was granted.

Home seemed to be the only escape from the horror at school.  I
desperately wished I would never have to go out again.

17.  "Do You Want Our Children to Become Blacks" My Parents' Dilemma

(August-October 1966)

Home was no relief this time.  My parents seemed distracted, and hardly
noticed me.  When Father was not pacing up and down the apartment, he
was shut in his study.

Mother threw one waste basketful of crushed paper balls after another
into the kitchen stove.  My grandmother also looked as though she was
expecting disaster.  Her intense eyes were fixed on my parents, full of
anxiety.  Timorously, I watched their moods, too afraid to ask what was
wrong.

My parents did not tell me about a conversation they had had some
evenings before.  They had been sitting by an open window, outside
which a loudspeaker tied to a street lamp was blasting out endless
quotations of Mao's, particularly one about all revolutions being
violent by definition - 'the savage tumult of one class overthrowing
another."  The quotations were chanted again and again in a high
pitched shriek that roused fear and, for some, excitement.  Every now
and then there were announcements of 'victories' achieved by Red
Guards: they had raided more homes of 'class enemies' and 'smashed
their dogs' heads."

My father had been looking out at the blazing sunset.

He turned to my mother and said slowly: "I don't understand the
Cultural Revolution.  But I am certain that what is happening is
terribly wrong.  This revolution cannot be justified by any Marxist or
Communist principles.  People have lost their basic rights and
protection.  This is unspeakable.  I am a Communist, and I have a duty
to stop a worse disaster.  I must write to the Party leadership, to
Chairman Mao."

In China there was virtually no channel through which people could
voice a grievance, or influence policy, except appealing to the
leaders.  In this particular case, only Mao could change the situation.
Whatever Father thought, or guessed, about Mao's role, the only thing
he could do was to petition him.

My mother's experience told her that complaining was extremely
dangerous.  People who had done it, and their families, had suffered
vicious retribution.  She was silent for a long time, staring out over
the distant burning sky, trying to control her worry, anger, and
frustration.

"Why do you want to be a moth that throws itself into the fire?"

she said at last.

My father replied, "This is no ordinary fire.  It concerns the life and
death of so many people.  I must do something this time."

My mother said, with exasperation, "All right, you don't care about
yourself.  You have no concern for your wife.  I accept that.  But what
about our children?  You know what will happen to them once you get
into trouble.  Do you want our children to become "blacks"?"

My father said thoughtfully, as though he were trying to persuade
himself, "Every man loves his children.  You know that before a tiger
is about to jump and kill, he always looks back and makes sure that his
cub is all right.  Even a man-eating beast feels that way, let alone a
human being.

396 7)0 You Want Our Children to Become "Blacks '7' But a Communist has
to be more than that.  He has to think about other children.  What
about the children of the victims?"

My mother stood up and walked away.  It was no use.

Once she was on her own, she wept bitterly.

Father began to write his letter, tearing up draft after draft.  He had
always been a perfectionist, and a letter to Chairman Mao was no small
matter.  Not only did he have to formulate exactly what he wanted to
say, he had to try to minimize the potential consequences, particularly
to his family.  In other words, his criticism must not be seen as a
criticism.  He could not afford to offend Mao.

Father had begun thinking about his letter in June.

Waves of scapegoating had claimed several of his colleagues, and he
wanted to speak up for them.  But events had kept overtaking his plans.
Among other things, there had been more and more signs that he was
about to become a victim himself.  One day, my mother saw a prominent
wall poster in the center of Chengdu attacking him by name, calling him
'the number-one opponent of the Cultural Revolution in Sichuan."  This
was based on two accusations: the previous winter he had resistod
printing the article denouncing the Dramas of the Ming Mandarin, which
was Mao's original summons for the Cultural Revolution; and he had
drafted the "April Document," which opposed persecution and attempted
to limit the Cultural Revolution to nonpolitical debate.

When my mother told my father about the poster, he said at once that it
was the doing of the provincial Party leaders.  The two things it
accused him of were known only to a small circle at the top.  Father
felt convinced that they had now made up their minds to scapegoat him,
and he knew why.  Students from universities in Chengdu were beginning
to direct their offensive at the provincial leaders.

University students were entrusted with more information by the
Cultural Revolution Authority than middle-school pupils, and had been
told that Mao's real intention was to destroy the 'capitalist-roaders'
that is, Communist officials.  The students were generally not high
officials' children, as most Communist officials had married only after
the founding of the People's Republic in 1949 anti so did not have
children of university age.  Having no vested interest in the status
quo, the students were happy to turn on the officials.

The Sichuan authorities were outraged by the violence committed by
middle-school children, but the university students really made them
panic.  They felt they had to find a prominent scapegoat to placate the
students.  My father was one of the top officials in the field of
'culture," which was a major target of the Cultural Revolution.  He had
a reputation for insisting on his principles.  At a time when they
needed unanimity and obedience, they felt they could do without him.

Father's predicament was soon confirmed.  On 26 August he was asked to
attend a meeting for the students of Sichuan University, the most
prestigious university in the province.  They had been attacking the
chancellor and the senior staff, and were now raising their sights
toward the provincial Party officials.  The meeting was nominally for
the provincial leaders to hear the students' complaints.

Commissar Li sat on the platform, together with the whole panoply of
top Party officials.  The huge auditorium, the biggest in Chengdu, was
packed.

The students came to the meeting intending to make trouble, and the
hall was soon in pandemonium.  Students, shouting slogans and waving
flags, began jumping onto the stage to try to grab the microphone.
Although my father was not the chairman, it was he who was asked to
bring the situation under control.  While he was confronting the
students, the other Party officials left.

My father shouted: "Are you intelligent students, or are you hooligans?
Will you talk reason?"  In general, officials in China maintain an
impassive manner, in keeping with their status, but my father was
yelling like one of the stu 398 "Do You Want Our Children to Become
"Blacks"?"

dents.  Unfortunately, his genuineness did not impress them, and he
left amid much screaming of slogans.

Immediately afterward, huge wall posters appeared calling him 'the most
obstinate capitalist-roader, the diehard who opposes the Cultural
Revolution."

This meeting became a milestone.  It was from it that the Red Guard
group at Sichuan University took its name - 'z6 August."  This
organization was to become the core of a province wide bloc,
incorporating millions of people, and the major force in the Cultural
Revolution in Sichuan.

After the meeting, the provincial authorities ordered my father not to
leave our apartment under any circumstances for his own 'protection."
My father could see that he had first been deliberately exposed to the
students as a target, and then put under virtual house arrest.  He
added his own anticipated victimization to his letter to Mao.  One
night, with tears in his eyes, he asked my mother to take the letter to
Peking now that he had lost his freedom.

My mother had never wanted him to write the letter, but now she changed
her mind.  What tipped the balance was the fact that he was being
turned into a victim.  This meant that her children would become
'blacks' and she knew what that meant.  Going to Peking and appealing
to the top leaders was her only chance, however remote, of saving her
husband and her children.  She promised to take the letter.

On the last day of August I was awakened from an uneasy nap by a noise
from my parents' quarters.  I tiptoed to the half-opened door of my
father's study.  My father was standing in the middle of the room.
Several people were crowding around him.  I recognized them: they were
from his depa~uaent.  They all looked stern, devoid of their usual
eager-to-please smiles.  My father was saying, "Would you please thank
the provincial authorities for me?  I'm very grateful for their
concern.  But I prefer not to go into hiding.  A Communist should not
be afraid of students."

His voice was calm, but it contained a hint of emotion

which made me afraid.  Then I heard a rather important sounding man's
voice saying threateningly, "But Director Chang, surely the Party knows
best.  The university students are attacking you, and they can be
violent.  The Party thinks you should be placed under protection.  This
is the decision of the Party.  You must know that a Communist has to
obey Party decisions unconditionally."

After a silence, my father said quietly, "I obey the decision of the
Party.  I will go with you."

"But where to?"  I heard my mother asking.  Then an impatient man's
voice:

"The Party's instructions are: no one is to know."  When he came out of
the study my father saw me and took my hand.

"Father is going away for a while," he said.

"Be a good girl to your mother."

My mother and I walked with him to the side gate of the compound.  The
long path was lined with members of his department.  My heart was
pounding and my legs seemed to be made of cotton wool.  Father appeared
very agitated.  His hand was shaking in mine.  I stroked it with my
other hand.

A car was parked outside the gate.  The door was held open for him.
There were two men in the car, one in front and one in the back.
Mother's face was taut, but she was calm.  She looked into my father's
eyes and said, "Don't worry.  I will do it."  Without hugging me or my
mother, my father was gone.  The Chinese show little physical affection
in public, even at extraordinary times.

I did not realize that my father was being taken into custody, because
the act was dressed up as 'protection."

Being fourteen, I had not learned to decipher the regime's hypocritical
style; deviousness was involved here because the authorities had not
made up their minds what to do with my father.  As in most such cases,
the police played no role.  The people who came to take my father away
were members of his department with a verbal authorization from the
Provincial Party Committee.

As soon as Father was gone, my mother threw a few

clothes into a bag and told us she was going to Peking.  My father's
letter was still in draft form, with scribbles and alterations.  The
minute he saw the staff posse coming he had pushed it into her hand.

My grandmother hugged my four-year-old brother Xiao-fang and wept.  I
said I wanted to go with my mother to the station.  There was no lime
to wait for a bus, so we jumped into a tricycle taxi.

I was fearfid and confused.  My mother did not explain what was
happening.  She looked strained and preoccupied, deep in her thoughts.
When I asked her what was going on, she said briefly that I would know
in time, and left it at that.  I assumed she thought it was too
complicated to explain, and I was used to being told I was too young to
know certain things.  I could also tell that my mother was busy sizing
up the situation and planning her next moves, and I did not want to
distract her.  What I did not know was that she was battling to
comprehend the confused situation herself.

We sat in the tricycle taxi silent and tense, my hand in hers.  My
mother kept glancing over her shoulder: she knew the authorities would
not want her to get to Peking, and had only let me come with her so I
could be a witness in case anything happened.  At the station she
bought a 'hard-seat' ticket for the next train to Peking.  It was not
due until dawn, so we sat down on a bench in the waiting room, a kind
of shed with no walls.

I huddled up against her to wait for the long hours to pass.  Silently,
we gazed at the darkness descending over the cement ground of the
square in front of the station.  A few feeble bare bulbs on top of
wooden lampposts were shedding a pale light, reflected in the puddles
of water left over from a heavy thunderstorm that morning.  I felt
chilly in my summer blouse.  My mother wrapped her raincoat around me.
As the night dragged on, she told me to go to sleep.  Exhausted, I
dozed off with my head on her lap.

I was awakened by a movement of her knees.  I lifted my

My Parents' Dilemma 4o i head and saw two people in hooded raincoats
standing in front of us.  They were arguing about something in low
voices.  In my muddled state, I could not work out what they were
saying.  I could not even tell whether they were men or women.  I
vaguely heard my mother say, in a calm, restrained voice, "I will shout
for the Red Guards."  The gray-hooded raincoats fell silent.  They
whispered to each other and then walked away, obviously not wanting to
attract attention.

At dawn, my mother got on the train to Peking.

Years later she told me that the two people were women she knew, junior
officials from my father's depasiment.

They told her the authorities had ruled that her going to Peking was an
'anti-Party' act.  She quoted the Party charter, which said that it was
the right of any Party member to appeal to the leaders.  When the
emissaries indicated that they had men wailing in a car who could seize
her by force, my mother said that if they did she would shout for help
from the Red Guards around the station and tell them they were trying
to stop her going to Peking to see Chairman Mao.  I asked her how she
could be sure the Red Guards would help her rather than the pursuers.

"Suppose they denounced you to the Red Guards as a class enemy who was
trying to escape?"  Mother smiled and said, "I calculated that they
would not take the risk.  I was prepared to gamble everything.  I had
no alternative."

In Peking my mother took my father's letter to a 'grievance office."
Chinese rulers throughout history, having never permitted an
independent legal system, had set up offices where ordinary people
could lodge grievances against their bosses, and the Communists
inherited this tradition.  When during the Cultural Revolution it began
to look as though Communist bosses were losing their power, many people
who had been persecuted by them in the past flooded into Peking to
appeal.  But the Cultural Revolution Authority soon made it clear that
'class enemies' were not allowed to complain, even against
'capitalist-roaders."  If they tried to do so they would be doubly
punished.

Few cases concerning senior officials like my father were presented to
the grievance office, so my mother received special attention.  She was
also one of the very few spouses of victims who had the courage to go
and appeal in Peking, as they were under pressure to 'draw a line'
between themselves and those accused rather than invite trouble by
speaking up for the victims.  My mother was received almost immediately
by Vice-Premier Tao Zhu, who was the head of the Central Department of
Public Affairs and one of the leaders of the Cultural Revolution at the
time.

She gave him my father's letter, and pleaded with him to order the
Sichuan authorities to release my father.

A couple of weeks later, Tao Zhu saw her again.  He gave her a letter
which said my father had acted in a perfectly constitutional manner and
in concert with the Sichuan party leadership, and should be released at
once.  Tao had not investigated the case.  He took my mother's word,
because what had happened to my father was a common occurrence: Party
officials all over China were choosing scapegoats in their panic to
save their own skins.  Tao gave her the letter directly rather than
sending it through normal Party channels, knowing they were in
disarray.

Tao Zhu showed he understood and agreed with the other concerns in my
father's letter: the epidemic of scape boating and the widespread
random violence.  My moO' could see he wanted to control the situation.
As it happened, because of this, he himself was soon to be condemned as
'the third biggest capitalist-roader," after Lin Shaoqi and Deng
Xiaoping.

Meanwhile, my mother hand-copied Tao Zhu's letter, mailed the copy to
my grandmother and asked her to show it to my father's deparunent and
to tell them that she would return only after they released my father.
My mother was worried that if she returned to Sichuan the authorities
there might arrest her, seize the letter and not release my father. She
felt that, on balance, her best bet was to stay in Peking, where she
could continue to exercise pressure.

My grandmother passed on my mother's hand-copied text of Tao Zhu's
letter.  But the provincial authorities said the whole thing was a
misunderstanding, and that they were just protecting my father.  They
insisted that my mother must come back and stop her individualistic
meddling.

Officials came to our apartment several times to try to persuade my
grandmother to go to Peking and bring my mother back.  One said to her,
"I'm really thinking of your daughter.  Why persist in misunderstanding
the Party?  The Party was only trying to protect your son-in-law.  Your
daughter would not listen to the Party and went to Peking.

I'm worried for her that if she does not come back, she will be
regarded as anti-Party.  And you know how serious that is.  Being her
mother, you must do what is best for her.  The Party has promised that
as long as she comes back and makes a self-criticism, she will be
forgiven."

The thought that her daughter was in trouble brought my grandmother to
the verge of collapse.  After several such sessions, she was wavering.
Then one day her mind was made up for her: she was told that my father
was having a nervous breakdown, and only when my mother came home would
they send him to a hospital.

The Party gave my grandmother two tickets, one for herself and one for
Xiao-fang, and they set off to Peking, thirty-six hours away by train.
As soon as my mother heard the news, she sent a telegram to tell my
father's department she was on her way, and started making arrangements
to return home.  She arrived back with my grandmother and Xiao-fang in
the second week of October.

During her absence, the whole of September, I had stayed at home to
keep my grandmother company.  I could see that she was consumed by
worry, but I did not know what was going on.  Where was my father?  Was
he under arrest,

or was he being protected?  Was my family in trouble or not?  I did not
know no one said anything.

I could stay at home because the Red Guards never exercised the
rigorous control the Party did.  Besides, I had a sort of 'patron' in
the Red Guards, Geng, my gauche fifteen-year-old boss, who had made no
effort to summon me back to the school.  But at the end of September he
telephoned to urge me to get back before I October, National Day, or I
would never be able to join the Red Guards.

I was not forced to join the Red Guards.  I was keen to do so.  In
spite of what was happening around me, my aversion and fear had no
clear object, and it never occurred to me to question the Cultural
Revolution or the Red Guards explicitly.  They were Mao's creations,
and Mao was beyond contemplation.

Like many Chinese, I was incapable of rational thinking in those days.
We were so cowed and contorted by fear and indoctrination that to
deviate from the path laid down by Mao would have been inconceivable.
Besides, we had been overwhelmed by deceptive rhetoric, disinformation,
and hypocrisy, which made it virtually impossible to see through the
situation and to form an intelligent judgment.

Back at school, I heard that there had been many complaints from 'reds'
demanding to know why they had not been admitted to the Red Guards.
That was why it was important to be there on National Day, as there was
going to be a big enrollment, incorporating all the rest of the 'reds."
So, at the very time the Cultural Revolution had brought disaster on my
family, I became a Red Guard.

I was thrilled by my red arm band with its gold characters.  It was the
fashion of the day for Red Guards to wear old army uniforms with
leather belts, like the one Mao was seen wearing at the beginning of
the Cultural Revolution.

I was keen to follow the fashion, so as soon as I was enrolled I rushed
home, and from the bottom of an old trunk I dug out a pale-gray Lenin
jacket which had been my mother's uniform in the early 1950S.  It was a
little too big, so I got my grandmother to take it in.  With a leather
belt from a pair of my father's trousers my costume was complete.  But
out on the streets I felt very uncomfortable.

I found my image too aggressive.  Still, I kept the outfit on.

Soon after this my grandmother went to Peking.  I had to stay in the
school, having just joined the Red Guards.

Because of what had happened at home, the school frightened and
startled me all the time.  When I saw the 'blacks' and 'grays' having
to clean the toilets and the grounds, their heads bowed, a creeping
dread came over me, as though I were one of them.  When the Red Guards
went off at night on house raids, my legs went weak, as if they were
heading for my family.  When I noticed pupils whispering near me, my
heart started to palpitate frantically:

were they saying that I had become a 'black," or that my father had
been arrested?

But I found a refuge: the Red Guard reception office.

There were a lot of visitors to the school.  Since September 1966, more
and more young people were on the road, traveling all over the country.
To encourage them to travel around and stir things up, transport, food,
and accommodations were provided free.

The reception office was in what had once been a lecture hall.  The
wandering and often aimless visitors would be given cups of tea and
chatted to.  If they claimed to have serious business, the office would
make an appointment for them to see one of the school Red Guard
leaders.  I zeroed in on this office because the people in it did not
have to participate in actions like guarding the 'blacks' and 'grays,"
or go on house raids.  I also liked it because of the five girls
working there.  There was an air of warmth and lack of zealotry around
them which made me feel soothed the moment I met them.

A lot of people used to come to the office, and many would hang around
to chat with us.  There was often a line at the door, and some returned
again and again.  Looking back now, I can see that the young men really
wanted some female company.  They were not that engrossed in the
revolution.  But I remember being extremely earnest.  I never avoided
their gazes or returned their winks, and I conscientiously took notes
of all the nonsense they spouted.

One hot night two rather coarse middle-aged women turned up at the
reception office, which was boisterous as usual.  They introduced
themselves as the director and deputy director of a residents'
committee near the school.

They talked in a very mysterious and grave manner, as though they were
on some grand mission.  I had always disliked this kind of affectation,
so I turned my back.  But soon I could tell that an explosive piece of
information had been delivered.  The people who had been hanging around
started shouting, "Get a truck!  Get a truck!  Let's all go there!"
Before I knew what was happening, I was swept out of the room by the
crowd and into a truck.  As Mao had ordered the workers to support the
Red Guards, trucks and drivers were permanently at our service.  In the
truck, I was squeezed next to one of the women.  She was retelling her
story, her eyes full of eagerness to ingratiate herself with us.  She
said that a woman in her neighborhood was the wife of a Kuomintang
officer who had fled to Taiwan, and that she had hidden a portrait of
Chiang Kai-shek in her apa~iment.

I did not like the woman, especially her toadying smile.

And I resented her for making me go on my first house raid.  Soon the
truck stopped in front of a narrow alley.  We all got out and followed
the two women down the cobbled path.  It was pitch-dark, the only light
coming from the crevices between the planks of wood that formed the
walls of the houses.  I staggered and slipped, trying to fall behind.

The apa~i,nent of the accused woman consisted of two rooms, and was so
small that it could not hold our truckful of people.  I was only too
happy to stay outside.  But before long someone shouted that space had
been made for those outside to come in and 'receive an education in
class struggle."

As soon as I was pressed into the room with the others, my nostrils
were filled with the stench of feces, urine, and unwashed bodies.  The
room had been turned upside down.  Then I saw the accused woman.  She
was perhaps in her forties, kneeling in the middle of the room, partly
naked.  The room was lit by a bare fifteen-watt bulb.  In its shadows,
the kneeling figure on the floor looked grotesque.

Her hair was in a mess, and part of it seemed to be matted with blood.
Her eyes were bulging out in desperation as she shrieked: "Red Guard
masters!  I do not have a portrait of Chiang Kai-shek!  I swear I do
not!"  She was banging her head on the floor so hard there were loud
thuds and blood oozed from her forehead.  The flesh on her back was
covered with cuts and bloodstains.  When she lifted her bottom in a
kowtow, murky patches were visible and the smell of excrement filled
the air.  I was so frightened that I quickly averted my eyes.  Then I
saw her tormentor, a seventeen-year-old boy named Chian, whom up to now
I had rather liked.  He was lounging in a chair with a leather belt in
his hand, playing with its brass buckle.

"Tell the truth, or I'll hit you again," he said languidly.

Chian's father was an army officer in Tibet.  Most officers sent to
Tibet left their families in Chengdu, the nearest big city in China
proper, because Tibet was considered an uninhabitable and barbaric
place.  Previously I had been rather attracted by Chian's languorous
manner, which had given an impression of gentleness.  Now I murmured,
trying to control the quaking in my voice, "Didn't Chairman Mao teach
us to use verbal struggle [wendou] rather than violent struggle
[wu-dou]?  Maybe we shouldn't... ?"

My feeble protest was echoed by several voices in the room.  But Chian
cast us a disgusted sideways glance and said emphatically: "Draw a line
between yourselves and the class enemy.  Chairman Mao says, "Mercy to
the enemy is cruelty to the people!"  If you are afraid of blood, don't
be Red Guards!"  His face was twisted into ugliness by fanaticism.  The
rest of us fell silent.  Although it was impossible to feel anything
but revulsion at what he was doing, we could not argue with him.  We
had been taught to be ruthless to class enemies.  Failure to do so
would make us class enemies ourselves.  I turned and walked quickly
into the garden at the back.  It was crammed with Red Guards with
shovels.  From inside the house the sound of lashes started again,
accompanied by screams that made my hair stand on end.  The yelling
must have been unbearable for the others too, because many swiftly
straightened up from their digging: "There is nothing here.  Let's
go!

Let's go?  As we passed through the room, I caught sight of Chian
standing casually over his victim.  Outside the door, I saw the woman
informer with the ingratiating eyes.

Now there was a cringing and frightened look there.  She opened her
mouth as if to say something, but no words came out.  As I glanced at
her face, it dawned on me that there was no portrait of Chiang
Kai-shek.  She had denounced the poor woman out of vindictiveness.  The
Red Guards were being used to set He old scores.  I climbed back into
the truck full of disgust and rage.

18.  "More Than Gigantic

Wonderful News'm

Pilgrimage to Peking

(October-December 1966)

I found an excuse to get out of school, and was home again the next
morning.  The apariment was empty.  My father was in detention.  My
mother, grandmother, and Xiao-fang were in Peking.  My teenage siblings
were living their own, separate lives elsewhere.

Jin-ming had resented the Cultural Revolution from the very beginning.
He was in the same school as me, and was in his first year.  He wanted
to become a scientist, but this was denounced by the Cultural
Revolution as 'bourgeois."

He and some boys in his form had formed a gang before the Cultural
Revolution.  They loved adventure and mystery, and had called
themselves the "Iron-Wrought Brotherhood."  Jin-ming was their
number-one brother.  He was tall, and brilliant at his studies.  He had
been giving his form weekly magic shows using his chemistry knowledge,
and had been openly skipping lessons which he was not interested in or
which he had already gone beyond.

And he was fair and generous to the other boys.

When the school Red Guard organization was set up on

August, Jin-ming's 'brotherhood' was merged into it.

He and his gang were given the job of printing leaflets and
distributing them on the streets.  The leaflets had been written by
older Red Guards in their mid-teens and typically had rifles like
"Founding Declaration of the First Brigade of the First Army Division
of the Red Guards of the Number Four School' (all Red Guard
organizations had grand names), "Solemn Statement' (a pupil announced
he was changing his name to "Huang the Guard for Chairman Mao'), "More
Than Gigantic Wonderful News' (a member of the Cultural Revolution
Authority had just given an audience to some Red Guards), and "The
Latest Most Supreme Instructions' (a word or two by Mao had just been
leaked out).

Jin-ming was soon bored stiff by this gibberish.  He started to absent
himself from his missions, and became interested in a girl of his age,
thirteen.  She seemed to him the perfect lady beautiful, gentle, and
slightly aloof, with a touch of shyness.  He did not approach her, but
was content to admire her from afar.

One day the pupils in his form were summoned to go on a house raid. The
older Red Guards said something about 'bourgeois intellectuals." All
members of the family were declared prisoners and ordered to gather in
one room while the Red Guards searched the rest of the house.

Jin-ming was appointed to watch the family.  To his delight, the girl
was the other 'jailer."

There were three 'prisoners': a middle-aged man and his son and
daughter-in-law.  They had obviously been expecting the raid, and sat
with resigned expressions on their faces, staring into Jin-ming's eyes
as though into space.  Jin-ming felt very awkward under their gaze, and
he was also uneasy because of the presence of the girl, who looked
bored and kept glancing toward the door.  When she saw several boys
carrying a huge wooden case full of porcelain, she mumbled to Jin-ming
that she was going to have a look, and left the room.

3i

Facing his captives alone, Jin-ming felt his discomfort growing.  Then
the woman prisoner stood up and said she wanted to go and breast-feed
her baby in the next room.

Jin-ming readily agreed.

The moment she left the room, the object of Jin-ming's affection rushed
in.  Sternly, she asked him why a prisoner was at large.  When Jin-ming
said he had given permission, she yelled at him for being 'soft on
class enemies."  She was wearing a leather belt on what Jin-ming had
thought of as her 'willowy' waist.  Now she pulled it off and pointed
it at his nose a stylized Red Guard posture while she screamed at him.
Jin-ming was struck dumb.  The girl was unrecognizable.  All of a
sudden she was far from gentle, shy, or lovely.  She was all hysterical
ugliness.  Thus was Jin-ming's first love extinguished.

But he shouted back.  The girl left the room and returned with an older
Red Guard, the leader of the group.  He started yelling so much his
spittle splashed on Jinming, and he too pointed his rolled-up belt at
him.  Then he stopped, realizing that they should not be washing their
dirty linen in front of class enemies.  He ordered Jin-ming to go back
to the school to 'wait for adjudication."

That evening, the Red Guards in Jin-ming's form held a meeting without
him.  When the boys came back to the dormitory, their eyes avoided his.
They behaved distantly for a couple of days.  Then they toldJin-ming
they had been arguing with the militant girl.  She had reported
Jin-ming's 'surrender to the class enemies' and had insisted that he be
given a severe punishment.  But the Iron-Wrought Brotherhood defended
him.  Some of them resented the girl, who had been terribly aggressive
toward other boys and girls too.

Still, Jin-ming was punished: he was ordered to pull out grass
alongside the 'blacks' and 'grays."  Mao's instruction to exterminate
grass had led to a constant demand for manpower because of the grass's
obstinate nature.  This

412 Wl ore Than Gigantic Wonderful News' fortuitous by offered a form
of punishment for the newby created 'class enemies."

Jin-ming pulled up grass only for a few days.  His Iron Wrought
Brotherhood could not bear to see him suffer.

But he had been classified as a 'sympathizer with class enemies," and
was never sent on any more raids, which suited him fine.  He soon
embarked on a journey with his brotherhood sight-seeing all over the
country, taking in China's rivers and mountains, but, unlike most Red
Guards, Jin-ming never made the pilgrimage to Peking to see Mao.  He
did not come home until the end of ,966.

My sister Xiao-hong, at fifteen, was a founding member of the Red
Guards at her school.  But she was only one among hundreds, as the
school was crammed with officials' children, many of them competing to
be active.  She hated and feared the atmosphere of militancy and
violence so much that she was soon on the verge of a nervous
collapse.

She came home to ask my parents for help at the beginning of September,
only to find they were not there: my father was in detention and my
mother had gone to Peking.  My grandmother's anxiety made her even more
scared, so she returned to her school.  She volunteered to help 'guard'
the school library, which had been ransacked and sealed, like the one
at my school.  She spent her days and nights reading, devouring all the
forbidden fruits she could.  It was this that held her together.  In
mid-September, she set out on a long tour around the country with her
friends and like Jin-ming she did not come home until the end of the
year.

My brother Xiao-her was almost twelve, and was at the same key primary
school I had attended.  When the Red Guards were formed in the middle
schools, Xiao-her and his friends were eager to join.  To them the Red
Guards meant freedom to live away from home, staying up all night, and
power over adults.  They went to my school and begged to be allowed
into the Red Guards.  To get rid of

Pilgrimage to Peking 4x 3 them, one Red Guard said offnandedly, "You
can form the First Army Division of Unit 4969."  So Xiao-her became the
head of the Propaganda Department of a troop of twenty boys, all the
others being 'commander," 'chief of staff," and so on.  There were no
privates.

Xiao-her joined in hitting teachers twice.  One of the victims was a
sports teacher, who had been condemned as a 'bad element."  Some girls
of Xiao-her's age had accused the teacher of touching their breasts and
thighs during gym lessons.  So the boys set upon him, not least to
impress the girls.  The other teacher was the moral tutor.  As corporal
punishment was banned in schools, she would complain to the parents,
who would beat their sons.

One day, the boys set out on a house raid, and were assigned to go to a
household which was rumored to be that of an ex-Kuomintang family. They
did not know what exactly they were supposed to do there.  Their heads
had been filled with vague notions of finding something like a diary
saying how the family longed for Chiang Kai-shek's comeback and hated
the Communist Party.

The family had five sons, all well-built and tough looking  They stood
by the door, arms akimbo, and looked down at the boys with their most
intimidating stares.  Only one boy attempted to tiptoe in.  One of the
sons picked him up by the scruff of his neck and threw him out with one
hand.  This put an end to any further such 'revolutionary actions' by
Xiao-her's 'division."

So, in the second week of October, while Xiao-her was living at his
school and enjoying his freedom, Jin-ming and my sister were away
traveling, and my mother and grandmother were in Peking, I was alone at
home when one day, without warning, my father appeared on the
doorstep.

It was an eerily quiet homecoming.  My father was a changed person.  He
was abstracted and sunk deep in thought, and did not say where he had
been or what had

4z4 ~14ore Than Gigantic Wonderful News' been happening to him.  I
listened to him pacing his room through sleepless nights, too
frightened and worried to sleep myself.  Two days later, to my
tremendous relief, my mother returned from Peking with my grandmother
and Xiao-fang.

My mother immediately went to my father's deparunent and handed Tao
Zhu's letter to a deputy director.  Straight away, my father was sent
to a health clinic.  My mother was allowed to go with him."

I went there to see them.  It was a lovely place in the country,
bordered on two sides by a beautiful green brook.

My father had a suite with a sitting room in which there was a row of
empty bookshelves, a bedroom with a large double bed, and a bathroom
with shiny white files.  Outside his balcony, several osmanthus trees
spread an intoxicating scent.  When the breeze blew, tiny golden
blossoms floated softly down to the grass less earth.

Both my parents seemed peaceful.  My mother told me they went fishing
in the brook every day.  I felt they were safe, so I told them I was
planning to leave for Peking to see Chairman Mao.  I had longed to make
this trip, like almost everybody else.  But I had not gone because I
felt I should be around to give my parents support.

Making the pilgrimage to Peking was very much encouraged and food,
accommodations, and transport were all free.  But it was not organized.
I left Chengdu two days later with the five other girls from the
reception office.  As the train whistled north, my feelings were a
mixture of excitement and nagging disquiet about my father.  Outside
the window, on the Chengdu Plain, some rice fields had been harvested,
and squares of black soil shone among the gold, forming a rich
patchwork.  The countryside had been only marginally affected by the
upheavals, in spite of repeated instigations by the Cultural Revolution
Authority led by Mme Mao.  Mao wanted the population fed so that they
could 'make revolution," so he did not give his wife his full backing.
The peasants knew that if they got involved and stopped producing food,
they would be the first to starve, as they had learned in the famine
only a few years before.  The cottages among the green bamboo groves
seemed as peaceful and idyllic as ever.  The wind gently swayed the
lingering smoke to form a crown over the graceful bamboo tips and the
concealed chimneys.  It was less than five months since the beginning
of the Cultural Revolution, but my world had changed completely.  I
gazed out at the quiet beauty of the plain, and let a wistful mood
envelop me.  Fortunately, I did not have to worry about being
criticized for being 'nostalgic," which was considered bourgeois, as
none of the other girls had an accusing turn of mind.  With them, I
felt I could relax.

The prosperous Chengdu Plain soon gave way to low hills.  The snowy
mountains of west Sichuan glistened in the distance.  Before very long
we were traveling in and out of the tunnels through the towering Qjn
Mountains, the wild range that cuts Sichuan off from the north of
China.

With Tibet to the west, the hazardous Yangtze Gorges to the east, and
the southern neighbors considered barbarians, Sichuan had always been
rather self-contained, and the Sichuanese were known for their
independent spirit.  Mao had been concerned about their legendary
inclination to seek some margin of independence, and had always made
sure the province was in the firm grip of Peking.

After the Qjn Mountains, the scenery became dramatically different. The
soft greenness gave way to harsh yellow earth, and the thatched
cottages of the Chengdu Plain were replaced by rows of dry mud
cave-huts.  It was in caves like these that my father had spent five
years as a young man.

We were only a hundred miles from Yan'an, where Mao had set up his
headquarters after the Long March.  It was there that my father dreamed
his youthful dreams and became a devoted Communist.  Thinking of him,
my eyes became moist.

The journey took two days and a night.  The attendants

4x6 ~lore Than Gigantic Wonderful News' came to talk to us often and
told us how envious they were that we would be seeing Chairman Mao
soon.

At Peking Station huge slogans welcomed us as "Chairman Mao's guests."
It was after midnight, yet the square in front of the station was lit
~up like daytime.  Searchlights swept through the thousands and
thousands of young people, all wearing red armbands and speaking often
mutually unintelligible dialects.  They were talking, shouting,
giggling, and quarreling against the background of a gigantic chunk of
stolid Soviet-style architecture the station itself.  The only Chinese
features were the pastiche pavilion like roofs on the two clock towers
at each end.

As I stumbled drowsily out into the searchlights, I was enormously
impressed by the building, its ostentatious grandeur and its shiny
marbled modernity.  I had been used to traditional dark timber columns
and rough brick walls.

I looked back, and with a surge of emotion saw a huge portrait of Mao
hanging in the center, under three golden characters, "Peking Station,"
in his calligraphy.

Loudspeakers directed us to the reception rooms in a corner of the
station.  In Peking, as in every other city in China, administrators
were appointed to arrange food and accommodations for the traveling
youngsters.  Dormitories in universities, schools, hotels, and even
offices were pressed into service.  After waiting on line for hours, we
were assigned to Q~mghua University, one of the most prestigious in the
country.  We were taken there by coach and told that food would be
provided in the canteen.  The running of the gigantic machine for the
millions of traveling youngsters was overseen by Zhou Enlai, who dealt
with the daily chores with which Mao could not be bothered.

Without Zhou or somebody like him, the country and with it the Cultural
Revolution would have collapsed, and Mao let it be known that Zhou was
not to be attacked.

We were a very serious group, and all we wanted to do was to see
Chairman Mao.  Unfortunately, we had just missed his fifth review of
Red Guards in Tiananmen

Square.  What were we to do?  Leisure activities and sightseeing were
out irrelevant to the revolution.  So we spent all our time on the
campus copying wall posters.  Mao had said that one purpose of
traveling was to 'exchange information about the Cultural Revolution."
That was what we would do: bring the slogans of the Peking Red Guards
back to Chengdu.

Actually, there was another reason for not going out:

transport was impossibly crowded and the university was out in the
suburbs, about ten miles from the city center.

Still, we had to tell ourselves that our disinclination to move was
correctly motivated.

Staying on the campus was intensely uncomfortable.

Even today I can still smell the latrines down the corridor from our
room, which were so blocked that the water from the washbasins and
urine and loosened excrement from the toilets flooded the tiled floor.
Fortunately, the doorway to the latrines had a ridge, which prevented
the stinking overflow from invading the corridor.  The university
administration was paralyzed, so there was nobody to get repairs done.
But children from the countryside were still using the toilets: manure
was not considered untouchable by peasants.  When they trudged out,
their shoes left highly odorous stains along the corridor and in the
rooms.

A week passed, and still there was no news of another rally at which we
could see Mao.  Subconsciously desperate to get away from our
discomfort, we decided to go to Shanghai to visit the site where the
Communist Party had been founded in 19:zl, and then on to Mao's
birthplace in Hunan, in south-central China.

These pilgrimages turned out to be hell: the trains were unbelievably
packed.  The dominance of the Red Guards by high officials' children
was coming to an end, because their parents were beginning to come
under attack as capitalist-roaders.  The oppressed 'blacks' and 'grays'
began to organize their own Red Guard groups and to travel.  The color
codes were beginning to lose their meaning.  I rem em 4x 8 Wlore Than
Gigantic Wonderful News' her meeting on one train a very beautiful,
slim girl of about eighteen, with unusually big, velvet black eyes and
long, thick eyelashes.  As was the custom, we started by asking each
other what 'family background' we were from.  I was amazed at the
unembarrassed manner with which this lovely girl replied that she was a
'black."  And she seemed confidently to be expecting us 'red' girls to
be friendly with her.

The six of us were very un militant in our behavior, and our seats were
always the center of boisterous chatting.

The oldest member of our group was eighteen, and she was particularly
popular.  Everyone called her "Plumpie," as she was very well padded
all around.  She laughed a lot, with a deep, chesty, operafc sound. She
sang a lot too, but, of course, only songs of Chairman Mao's
quotations.

All songs except these and a few in praise of Mao were banned, like all
other forms of entertainment, and remained so for the ten years of the
Cultural Revolution.

This was the happiest I had been since the start of the

Cultural Revolution, in spite of the persistent worry about my father
and the agony involved in traveling.  Every inch of space in the trains
was occupied, even the luggage racks.

The toilet was jam-packed: no one could get in.  Only our determination
to see the holy sites of China sustained us.

Once, I desperately needed to relieve myself.  I was sitting squeezed
up next to a window, because five people were crammed onto a narrow
seat made for three.  With an incredible struggle I reached the toilet
but when I got there I decided it was impossible to use it.  Even if
the boy who sat on the lid of the tank with his feet on the toilet seat
cover could lift his legs for one moment, even if the girl who sat
between his feet could somehow manage to be held up briefly by the
others filling every usable space around her, I could not bring myself
to do it in front of all these boys and girls.  I returned to my seat
on the verge of tears.  Panic worsened the bursting sensation, and my
legs were shaking.  I resolved to use the toilet at the next stop.

After what seemed an interminable time, the train stopped at a small,
dusk-enveloped station.  The window was opened and I clambered out, but
when I came back I found

I could not get in.

I was perhaps the least athletic of us six.  Previously, whenever I had
had to climb into a train through the window, one of my friends had
always lifted me from the platform while others pulled me from inside.
This time, although I was being helped by about four people from
inside, I could not hoist my body high enough to get my head and elbows
in.  I was sweating like mad, even though it was freezing cold.  At
this point, the train started to pull away.  Panicking, I looked around
to see if there was anyone who could help.  My eyes fell on the thin,
dark face of a boy who had sidled up beside me.  But his intention was
not to lend me a hand.

I had my purse in a pocket of my jacket, and because of my climbing
position it was quite visible.  With two fingers, the boy picked it
out.  He had presumably chosen the moment of departure to snatch it.  I
burst out crying.  The boy paused.  He looked at me, hesitated, and put
the purse back.  Then he took hold of my right leg and hoisted me up. I
landed on the table as the train was beginning to pick up speed.

Because of this incident, I developed a soft spot for adolescent
pickpockets.  In the coming years of the Cultural Revolution, when the
economy was in a shambles, theft was widespread, and I once lost a
whole year's food coupons.  But whenever I heard that policemen or
other custodians of' law and order' had beaten a pickpocket, I always
felt a pang.  Perhaps the boy on that winter platform had shown more
humanity than the hypocritical pillars of society.

Altogether we traveled about 2,000 miles on this trip, in a state of
exhaustion such as I had never experienced in my life.  We visited
Mao's old house, which had been turned into a museum-cum-shrine.  It
was rather grand quite different from my idea of a lodging for
exploited peasants, as I had expected it to be.  A cap ton underneath
an enormous photograph of Mao's mother said that she had been a very
kind person and, because her family was relatively well off, had often
given food to the poor.  So our Great Leader's parents had been rich
peasants!  But rich peasants were class enemies!  Why were Chairman
Mao's parents heroes when other class enemies were objects of hate? The
question frightened me so much that I immediately suppressed it..

When we got back to Peking in mid-November, the capital was freezing.
The reception offices were no longer at the station, because the area
was too small for the huge number of youngsters now pouring in.  A
truck took us to a park where we spent the whole night waiting for
accommodations to be allocated.  We could not sit down because the
ground was covered with frost and it was unbearably cold.  I dozed off
for a second or two standing up.  I was not used to the harsh Peking
winter and, having left home in the autumn, had not brought any winter
clothes with me.  The wind cut through my bones, and the night seemed
never-ending.  So did the line.  It meandered around and around the
ice-covered lake in the middle of the park.

Dawn came and went and we were still in line, absolutely exhausted.  It
was not until dusk fell that we reached our accommodations: the Central
Drama School.  Our room had once been used for singing classes.  Now
there were two rows of straw mattresses on the floor, no sheets or
pillows.  We were met by some air force officers, who said they had
been sent by Chairman Mao to look after us and give us military
training.  We all felt very moved by the concern Chairman Mao showed
us.

Military training for the Red Guards was a new development.  Mao had
decided to put a brake on the random destruction which he had
unleashed.  The hundreds of Red Guards lodged in the Drama School were
organized into a 'regiment' by the air force officers.  We struck up a
good relationship with them, and liked two
officers in particular, whose family backgrounds we learned at once, as
was customary.  The company commander had been a peasant from the
north, while the political commissar came from an intellectual's family
in the famous garden city of Suzhou.  One day they proposed taking the
six of us to the zoo, but asked us not to tell the others because their
jeep could not hold any more people.  Besides, they implied, they were
not supposed to divert us to activities irrelevant to the Cultural
Revolution.  Not wanting to get them into trouble we declined, saying
we wanted to 'stick to making revolution."  The two officers brought us
bagfuls of big ripe apples, which were seldom seen in Chengdu, and
bunches of toffee-coated water chestnuts, which we had all heard of as
a great Peking specialty.  To repay their kindness, we sneaked into
their bedroom and collected their dirty clothes, then washed them with
great enthusiasm.  I remember struggling with the big khaki uniforms,
which were extremely heavy and hard in the icy water.  Mao had told the
people to learn from the armed forces, because he wanted everyone to be
as regimented and indoctrinated with loyalty to him alone as the army
was.  Learning from servicemen had gone hand in hand with the promotion
of affection for them, and numerous books, articles, songs, and dances
featured girls helping soldiers by washing their clothes.

I even washed their underpants, but nothing sexual ever entered my
mind.  I suppose many Chinese girls of my generation were too dominated
by the crushing political upheavals to develop adolescent sexual
feelings.  But not all.  The disappearance of parental control meant it
was a time of promiscuity for some.  When I got back home I heard about
a former classmate of mine, a pretty girl of fifteen, who went off
traveling with some Red Guards from Peking.  She had an affair on the
way and came back pregnant.  She was beaten by her father, followed by
the accusing eyes of the neighbors, and enthusiastically gossiped about
by her comrades.  She hanged
herself, leaving a note saying she was 'too ashamed to live."  No one
challenged this medieval concept of shame, which might have been a
target of a genuine cultural revolution.  But it was never one of Mao's
concerns, and was not among the 'olds' which the Red Guards were
encouraged to destroy.

The Cultural Revolution also produced a large number of militant
puritans, mostly young women.  Another girl from my form once received
a love letter from a boy of sixteen.  She wrote back calling him 'a
traitor to the revolution': "How dare you think about such shameless
things when the class enemies are still rampant, and people in the
capitalist world still live in an abyss of misery!"  Such a style was
affected by many of the girls I knew.  Because Mao called for girls to
be militant, femininity was condemned in the years when my generation
was growing up.  Many girls tried to talk, walk, and act like
aggressive, crude men, and ridiculed those who did not.  There was not
much possibility of expressing femininity anyway.  To start with, we
were not allowed to wear anything but the shapeless blue, grey or green
trousers and jackets.

Our air force officers drilled us round and round the Drama School's
basketball courts every day.  Next to the courts was the canteen.  My
eyes used to steal toward it as soon as we formed up, even if I had
just finished breakfast.

I was obsessed with food, although I was not sure whether this was due
to the lack of meat, or the cold, or the boredom of the drilling.  I
dreamed of the variety of Sichuan cuisine, of crispy duckling,
sweet-and-sour fish, "Drunken Chicken," and dozens of other succulent
delicacies.

None of us six girls was used to having money.  We also thought that
buying things was somehow 'capitalist."  So, in spite of my obsession
with food, I only bought one bunch of toffee-coated water chestnuts,
after my appetite for them had been whetted by the ones our officers
gave us.  I resolved to give myself this treat after a great deal of
agonizing and consultation with the other girls.  When I got home after
the trip I immediately devoured some stale biscuits, while handing my
grandmother the almost untouched money she had given me.  She pulled me
into her arms and kept saying, "What a silly girl!"

I also returned home with rheumatism.  Peking was so cold that water
froze in the taps.  Yet I was drilling, in the open, without an
overcoat.  There was no hot water to warm up our icy feet.  When we
first arrived, we were given a blanket each.  Some days later, more
girls arrived, but there were no more blankets.  We decided to give
them three and share the other three between us six.  Our upbringing
had taught us to help comrades in need.  We had been informed that our
blankets had come from stores reserved for wartime.  Chairman Mao had
ordered them to be taken out for the comfort of his Red Guards.  We
expressed our heartfelt gratitude to Mao.  Now, when we ended up with
hardly any blankets, we were told to be even more grateful to Mao,
because he had given us all China had.

The blankets were small, and could not cover two people unless they
slept close together.  The shapeless nightmares which had started after
I had seen the attempted suicide had become worse after my father was
taken away and my mother left for Peking; and since I slept badly, I
often twisted out from under the blanket.  The room was poorly heated,
and once I fell asleep, an icy chill invaded me.  By the time we left
Peking the joints in my knees were so inflamed that I could hardly bend
them.

My discomfort did not stop there.  Some children from the countryside
had fleas and lice.  One day I came into our room and saw one of my
friends crying.  She had just discovered a blot of tiny white eggs in
the armpit seam of her underwear lice eggs.  This threw me into a
panic, because lice caused unbearable itchiness and were associated
with dirtiness.  From then on, I felt itchy all the time, and examined
my underwear several times a day.  How I longed for Chairman Mao to see
us soon so I could go home!

On the afternoon of 24 November, I was in one of our usual Mao
quotation studying sessions in one of the boys' rooms (officers and
boys would not come into the girls' rooms, out of modesty).  Our nice
company commander came in with an unusually light gait and proposed
conducting us in the most famous song of the Cultural Revolution: "When
Sailing the Seas, We Need the Helmsman."

He had never done this before, and we were all pleasantly surprised. He
waved his arms beating time, his eyes shining, his cheeks flushed. When
he finished, and announced with restrained excitement that he had some
good news, we knew immediately what it was.

"We're going to see Chairman Mao tomorrow!"  he exclaimed.  The rest of
his words were drowned out by our cheers.  After the initial wordless
yelling, our excitement took the form of shouting slogans: "Long live
Chairman Mao!"

"We will follow Chairman Mao forever!"

The company commander told us that no one could leave the campus from
that minute on, and that we should watch one another to make sure of
this.  To be asked to watch one another was quite normal.  Besides,
these were safety measures for Chairman Mao, which we were only too
glad to apply.  After dinner, the officer approached my five companions
and me, and said in a hushed and solemn voice: "Would you like to do
something to ensure Chairman Mao's safety?"

"Of course!"  He signaled for us to keep quiet, and continued in a
whisper: "Would you propose before we leave tomorrow morning that we
all search each other to make sure that no one is carrying anything
they shouldn't?  You know, young people might forget about the rules
.... He had announced the rules earlier that we must not bring anything
metal, not even keys, to the rally.

Most of us could not sleep, and excitedly talked the night away.  At
four o'clock in the morning we got up and gathered in disciplined ranks
for the hour-and-a-half walk to Tiananmen Square.  Before our 'company'
set off, at a wink from the officer, Plumpie stood up and proposed a
search.  I could see that some of the others thought she was wasting
our time, but our company commander cheerfully seconded her proposal.
He suggested we search him first.

A boy was called to do this, and found a big bunch of keys on him.  Our
commander acted as though he had been genuinely careless, and gave
Plumpie a victorious smile.

The rest of us searched each other.  This roundabout way of doing
things reflected a Maoist practice: things had to look as though they
were the wish of the people, rather than commands from above. Hypocrisy
and playacting were taken for granted.

The early-morning streets were bursting with activity.

Red Guards were marching toward Tiananmen Square from all over the
capital.  Deafening slogans surged like roaring waves.  As we chanted,
we raised our hands and our Little Red Books formed a dramatic red line
against the darkness.  We reached the square at dawn.  I was placed in
the seventh row from the front on the wide northern pavement of the
Avenue of Eternal Peace to the east side of Tiananmen Square.  Behind
me were many more rows.

After lining us up tidily, our officers ordered us to sit down on the
hard ground cross-legged.  With my inflamed joints, this was agony, and
I soon got pins and needles in my bottom.  I was deadly cold and drowsy
and exhausted because I could not fall asleep.  The officers conducted
nonstop singing, making different groups challenge each other, to keep
up our spirits.

Shortly before noon, hysterical waves of "Long live Chairman Mao!"
roared from the east.  I had been flagging and was slow to realize that
Mao was about to pass by in an open car.  Suddenly thunderous yelling
exploded all around me.

"Long live Chairman Mao!  Long live Chairman Mao!"  People sitting in
front of me shot up and hopped in delirious excitement, their raised
hands frantically waving their Litfie Red Books.

"Sit down!  Sit down!"

I cried, in vain.  Our company commander had said that we all had to
remain seated throughout.  But few seemed to be observing the rules,
possessed by their urge to set eyes on Mao.

Having been sitting for so long, my legs had gone numb.

For some seconds, all I could see was a boiling sea of the backs of
heads.  When I finally managed to totter to my feet, I caught only the
very end of the motorcade.  Liu Shaoqi, the president, had his face
turned in my direction.

Wall posters had already started attacking Liu as "China's Khrushchev'
and the leading opponent of Mao.

Although he had not been officially denounced, it was clear that his
downfall was imminent.  In press reports of the Red Guard rallies, he
was always given a very undistinguished place.  In this procession,
instead of standing next to Mao, as the number-two man should have
done, he was right at the back, in one of the last cars.

Liu looked subdued and weary.  But I did not have any feelings for him.
Although he was the president, he did not mean anything to my
generation.  We had grown up imbued with the cult of Mao alone.  And if
Liu was against Mao, it seemed to us natural that he should go.

At that moment, with the sea of youngsters screaming their loyalty to
Mao, Liu must have felt how utterly hopeless his situation was.  The
irony was that he himself had been instrumental in promoting Mao's
deification, which had led to this explosion of fanaticism in the youth
of a nation which was largely unreligious.  Liu and his colleagues may
have helped deificao in order to appease him, thinking that he would be
satisfied with abstract glory and leave them to get on with the mundane
work, but Mao wanted absolute power both on earth and in heaven.  And
perhaps there was nothing they could have done: the cult of Mao may
have been unstoppable.

These reflections did not occur to me on the morning of 25 November
1966.  All I cared about then was catching a glimpse of Chairman Mao. I
turned my eyes quickly away from Liu to the front of the motorcade. I
spotted Mao's stalwart back, his right arm steadily waving.  In an
instant, he had disappeared.  My heart sank.  Was that all I would see
of Chairman Mao?  Only a fleeting glimpse of his back?

The sun seemed suddenly to have turned gray.  All around me the Red
Guards were making a huge din.  The girl standing next to me had just
pierced the index finger of her right hand and was squeezing blood out
of it to write something on a neatly folded handkerchief.  I knew
exactly the words she was going to use.  It had been done many times by
other Red Guards and had been publicized ad name am "I am the happiest
person in the world today.  I have seen our Great Leader Chairman Mao!"
Watching her, my despair grew.  Life seemed pointless.  A thought
flickered into my mind: perhaps I should commit suicide?

It vanished almost the next instant.  Looking back, I suppose the idea
was really a subconscious attempt to quantify my devastation at having
my dream smashed, especially after all the hardships I had suffered on
my journey.  The bursting trains, the inflamed knees, the hunger and
cold, the itchiness, the blocked toilets, the exhaustion all in the end
unrewarded.

Our pilgrimage was over and a few days later we headed home.  I had had
enough of the trip, and I longed for warmth and comfort, and a hot
bath.  But the thought of home was tinged with apprehension.  No matter
how uncomfortable, the journey had never been frightening, as my life
immediately prior to it had been.  Living in close contact with
thousands and thousands of Red Guards for well over a month, I had
never seen any violence, or felt terror.  The gigantic crowds,
hysterical though they were, were well disciplined and peaceful.  The
people I met were friendly.

Just before I left Peking, a letter came from my mother.

It said my father had fully recovered and everyone in Chengdu was fine.
But she added at the end that both she

4z8 Wlore Than Gigantic Wonder~l News' and my father were being
criticized as capitalist-roaders.

My heart sank.  By now it had become clear to me that
capitalist-roaders Communist officials were the main targets of the
Cultural Revolution.  I was soon to see what this meant for my family
and for me.

19.  "Where There Is a Will to Condemn, There Is Evidence'-My Parents
Tormented

(December 1966-1967)

A capitalist-roader was supposed to be a powerful official who was
pursuing capitalist policies.  But in reality no officials had any
choice about which policies they pursued.

The orders of Mao and those of his opponents were all presented as
coming from the Party, and the officials had to obey all of them even
though in doing so they were obliged to carry out many zigzags and even
U-turns.  If they really disliked a particular order, the most they
could do was engage in passive resistance, which they had to try hard
to disguise.  It was therefore impossible to determine whether
officials were capitalist-roaders or not on the basis of their work.

Many officials had their own views, but the Party rule was that they
must not reveal them to the public.  Nor did they dare to.  So whatever
the officials' sympathies were, they were unknown to the general
public.

But ordinary people were the very force Mao now ordered to attack
capitalist-roaders without, of course, the benefit of either
information or the right to exercise

43 "Where There Is a Will to Condemn, There Is Evidence' any
independent judgment.  So what happened was that officials came under
attack as capitalist-roaders because of the positions they held.
Seniority alone was not the cflteflon.  The decisive factor was whether
a person was the leader of a relatively self-contained unit or not. The
whole population was organized into units, and the people who
represented power to ordinary people were their immediate bosses unit
leaders.  In designating these people for attack, Mao was tapping into
the most obvious pool of resentment, in the same way that he had
incited pupils against teachers.  Unit leaders were also the key links
in the chain of the Communist power structure which Mao wanted to get
rid of.

It was because they were leaders of deparl,uents that both my parents
were denounced as capitalist-roaders.

"Where there is a will to condemn, there is evidence," as the Chinese
saying has it.  On this basis, all unit leaders across China, big and
small, were summarily denounced by people under them as
capitalist-roaders for implementing policies that were alleged to be
'capitalist' and anti Chairman Mao."  These included allowing free
markets in the countryside, advocating better professional skills for
workers, permitting relative literary and artistic freedom, and
encouraging competitiveness in sports now termed 'bourgeois
cups-and-medals mania."  Until now most officials had had no idea that
Mao had disliked these policies after all, the directives had all come
from the Party, which was led by him.  Now they were told, out of the
blue, that all these policies had come from the 'bourgeois
headquarters' within the Party.

In every unit there were people who became activists.

They were called Rebel Red Guards, or "Rebels' for short.

They wrote wall posters and slogans proclaiming "Down with the
capitalist-roaders," and held denunciation meetings against their
bosses.  The denunciations often sounded hollow, because the accused
simply said that they had been carrying out Party orders Mao had always
told them to

My Parents Tormented 43 i obey Party orders unconditionally, and had
never told them of the existence of the 'bourgeois headquarters."  How
were they to know?  And how could they have acted otherwise?

The officials had many supporters, some of whom rallied to their
defense.  They were called the "Loyalists."  Verbal and physical
battles broke out between them and the Rebels.  Because Mao never said
explicitly that all Party bosses should be condemned, some militants
became hesitant: what if the bosses they attacked turned out not to be
capitalist-roaders?  Beyond the posters and slogans and denunciation
meetings, ordinary people did not know what they were expected to do.

So when I returned to Chengdu in December 1966 I sensed a distinct
uncertainty in the air.

My parents were living at home.  The health clinic where my father had
been staying had asked them to leave in November because
capitalist-roaders were supposed to go back to their units to be
denounced.  The small canteen in the compound had been closed down, and
we all had to get our food from the big canteen, which went on working
normally.  My parents continued to receive their salaries every month,
in spite of the fact that the Party system was paralyzed and they did
not go to work.  Since their departments dealt with culture, and their
bosses in Peking were particularly hated by the Maos and had been
purged at the start of the Cultural Revolution, my parents were in the
direct line of fire.  They were attacked in wall posters with standard
abuse like "Bombard Chang Shou-yu' and "Burn Xia De-hong."  The
accusations against them were the same as those made against almost
every director of every Department of Public Affairs up and down the
country.

Meetings were convened in my father's department to denounce him.  He
was yelled at.  As with most political struggles in China, the real
impetus came from personal animosity.  Father's foremost accuser was a
Mrs.  Shau, a prim and fiercely self-righteous deputy section chief
who

432 "Where There Is a Will to Condemn, There Is Evidence' had long been
aspiring to get rid of the prefix 'deputy."

She considered that her promotion had been blocked by my father, and
was determined to take revenge.  Once she spat in his face and slapped
him.  But in general the anger was limited.  Many of the staff liked
and respected my father and were not fierce to him.  Outside his
department, some organizations for which he had been responsible, like
the Sichuan Daily, also held denunciation meetings against him.  But
the staff there bore no personal grudges against him, and the meetings
were formalities.

Against my mother there were no denunciation meetings at all.  As a
grass-roots official, she had looked after more individual units than
my father schools, hospitals, and entertainment groups.  Normally,
someone in her position would have been denounced by people from these
organizations.  But she was left alone by all of them.  She had been
responsible for solving their personal problems, such as housing
transfers, and pensions.  And she had done her job with unfailing
helpfulness and efficiency.  She had tried her best in previous
campaigns not to victimize anyone, and had in fact managed to protect
many.  People knew the risks she had run, and repaid her by refusing to
turn on her.

On my first evening back home my grandmother made 'cloud-swallowing'
dumplings and steamed rice in palm leaves filled with 'eight
treasures."  My mother gave me a cheerful account of what had been
happening to her and my father.  She said they had agreed they did not
want to be officials anymore after the Cultural Revolution.  They were
going to apply to be ordinary citizens, and enjoy a normal family life.
As I was to realize later, this was no more than a self-deluding
fantasy, because the Communist

Party allowed no opting out; but at the time they needed something to
hold on to.

My father also said: "Even a capitalist president can become an
ordinary citizen overnight.  It's a good thing not to be given
permanent power.  Otherwise officials will tend to abuse their power."
He then apologized to me for ha~Sng been dictatorial with the family.

"You are like singing cicadas silenced by chilling winter," he said,
'and it is good that you young people should rebel against us, the
older generation."  Then he said, half to me, half to himself, 'l think
there is nothing wrong with officials like me being subject to
criticism even a bit of hardship and loss of face."

This was another confused attempt by my parents to try to cope with the
Cultural Revolution.  They did not resent the prospect of losing their
privileged positions in fact, they were trying to see this as something
positive.

Nineteen sixty-seven came.  Suddenly, the Cultural Revolution switched
into high gear.  In its first stage, with the Red Guard movement, an
atmosphere of terror had been created.  Now Mao turned to his major
goal: to replace the 'bourgeois headquarters' and the existing Party
hierarchy with his personal power system.  Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping
were formally denounced and detained, as was Tao Zhu.

On 9 January, the People'sDaily and the radio announced that a "January
Storm' had started from Shanghai, where Rebels had taken control.  Mao
called on people throughout China to emulate them and seize power from
the capitalist-roaders.

"Seize power' (duo-quart)!  This was a magic phrase in China.  Power
did not mean influence over policies it meant license over people.  In
addition to money, it brought privilege, awe, and fawning, and the
opportunity to take revenge.  In China, there were virtually no safety
valves for ordinary people.  The whole country was like a pressure
cooker in which a gigantic head of compressed steam had built up. There
were no football matches, pressure groups, law suits, or even violent
films.  It was impossible to voice any kind of protest about the system
and its injustices, unthinkable to stage a demonstration. Even talking
about politics an important form of relieving pressure in most
societies was taboo.  Subordinates had very little chance of redress
against their bosses.  But if you were a boss of some kind, you had a
chance to vent your frustration.  So when Mao launched his call to
'seize power," he found a huge constituency of people who wanted to
take revenge on somebody.  Although power was dangerous, it was more
desirable than powerlessness, particularly to people who had never had
it.  Now it looked to the general public as if Mao was saying that
power was up for grabs.

In practically every unit in China, the morale of the Rebels was
immensely boosted.  So were their numbers.

All sorts of people -workers, teachers, shop assistants, even the staff
of government offices started calling themselves "Rebels."  Following
the example of Shanghai, they physically beat the now disorientated
"Loyalists' into surrender.  The earlier Red Guard groups, like the one
in my school, were disintegrating, because they had been organized
around the children of high officials, who were under attack.  Some
early Red Guards who opposed the new phase of the Cultural Revolution
were arrested.  One of the sons of Commissar Li was beaten to death by
Rebels who accused him of having let slip a remark against Mme Mao.

The people in my father's depafiment who had been in the posse which
had taken him away to be detained were now Rebels.  Mrs.  Shau was
chief of a Rebel group for all the Sichuan government offices, in
addition to being its branch leader in my father's depa~uuent.

No sooner were the Rebels formed than they split into factions and
fought for power in almost every work unit in China.  All sides accused
their opponents of being 'anti Cultural Revolution," or of being loyal
to the old Party system.  In Chengdu, the numerous groups quickly
coalesced into two opposing blocs, headed by two universiF Rebel
groups: the more militant 'z6 August' from Sichuan University, and the
relatively moderate "Red Chengdu' from Chengdu University.  Each
commanded a following of millions of people throughout the province. In
my father's department, Mrs.  Shau's group was affiliated with 26
August, and the opposing group mainly consisting of more moderate
people whom my father had liked and promoted, and who liked him with
the Red Chengdu.

Outside our apartment, beyond the compound walls, 26 August and Red
Chengdu each rigged up loudspeakers to trees and electricity poles,
which blasted out abuse of each other day and night.  One night, I
heard that 26 August had gathered hundreds of supporters and attacked a
factory which was a stronghold of Red Chengdu.  They captured the
workers and tortured them, using methods including 'singing fountains'
(splitting their skulls open so the blood burst out) and 'landscape
paintings' (slashing their faces into patterns).  Red Chengdu's
broadcasts said several workers had become martyrs by jumping from the
top of the building.  I gathered they had killed themselves because
they were unable to stand the torture.

One major target of the Rebels was the professional elite in every
unit, not only prominent doctors, artists, writers, and scientists, but
also engineers and graded workers, even model night-soil collectors
(people who collect human waste, which was extremely valuable to the
peasants).  They were accused of having been promoted by
capitalistroaders, but were really the object of their colleagues'
jealousy.  Other personal scores were also settled in the name of the
revolution.

The "January Storm' triggered brutal violence against the
capitalist-roaders.  Power was now being seized from Party officials,
and people were spurred on to abuse them.

Those who had hated their Party bosses grabbed the opportunity to take
revenge, although the victims of previous persecutions were not allowed
to act.  It was some time before Mao got around to making new
appointments, as he did not know whom to appoint at this stage, so
ambitious careerists were eager to show their militancy in the hope
that this would get them chosen as the new holders of power.  Rival
factions competed to outdo each other in brutality.  Much of the
population colluded, driven by intimidation, conformism, devotion to
Mao, desire to set He personal scores, or just the releasing of
frustration.

Physical abuse finally caught up with my mother.  It did not come from
people working under her, but mainly from ex-convicts who were working
in street workshops in her Eastern District robbers, rapists, drug
smugglers, and pimps.  Ulalike 'political criminals," who were on the
receiving end of the Cultural Revolution, these common criminals were
encouraged to attack designated victims.  They had nothing against my
mother personally, but she had been one of the top leaders in her
district, and that was enough.

At meetings held to denounce her, these ex-convicts were particularly
active.  One day she came home with her face twisted in pain.  She had
been ordered to kneel on broken glass.  My grandmother spent the
evening picking fragments of glass from her knees with tweezers and a
needle.  The next day she made my mother a pair of thick kneepads.  She
also made her a padded waist protector, because the tender structure of
the waist was where the assailants always aimed their punches.

Several times my mother was paraded through the streets with a dunce
cap on her head, and a heavy placard hanging from her neck on which her
name was written with a big cross over it to show her humiliation and
her demise.  Every few steps, she and her colleagues were forced to go
down on their knees and kowtow to the crowds.  Children would be
jeering at her.  Some would shout that their kowtowing did not make
enough noise and demand that they do it again.  My mother and her
colleagues then had to bang their foreheads loudly on the stone
pavement.

One day that winter there was a denunciation meeting at a street
workshop.  Before the meeting, while the participants had lunch in the
canteen, my mother and her colleagues were ordered to kneel for one and
a half hours on grit-covered ground in the open.  It was raining and
she got soaked to the skin; the biting wind sent icy chills through her
wet clothes and into her bones.  When the meeting started, she had to
stand bent double on the platform, trying to control her shivers.  As
the wild, empty screaming went on, her waist and neck became unbearably
painful.  She twisted herself slightly, and tried to lift her head a
bit to ease the aching.  Suddenly she felt a heavy blow across the back
of her head, which knocked her to the ground.

It was only some time later that she learned what had happened.  A
woman sitting in the front row, a brothel owner who had been imprisoned
when the Communists clamped down on prostitution, had fixated on my
mother, perhaps because she was the only woman on the platform.

The moment my mother lifted her head, this woman jumped up and thrust
an awl straight at her left eye.  The Rebel guard standing behind my
mother saw it coming and struck her to the ground.  Had it not been for
him, my mother would have lost her eye.

My mother did not tell us about this incident at the time.

She seldom referred to what happened to her at all.  When she had to
mention something like the broken glass she said it casually, trying to
make it sound as undramatic as possible.  She never showed the bruises
on her body, and she was always composed, even cheerful.  She did not
want us to worry about her.  But my grandmother could tell how much she
was suffering.  She would follow my mother anxiously with her eyes,
trying to hide her own pain.

One day our former maid came to see us.  She and her husband were among
the few who never broke off with our family through the whole of the
Cultural Revolution.  I felt immensely grateful for the warmth they
brought us, especially as they ran the risk of being accused as
'sympathizers of capitalist-roaders."  Awkwardly, she mentioned to my
grand mother that she had just seen my mother being paraded through the
streets.  My grandmother pressed her to say more, then suddenly
collapsed, the back of her head hitting the floor with a loud bang. She
had lost consciousness.

Gradually, she came to.  With tears rolling down her cheeks, she said,
"What has my daughter done to deserve this?"

My mother developed a hemorrhage from her womb, and for the next six
years, until she had a hysterectomy in 1973, she bled most days.
Sometimes it was so severe she would faint and had to be taken to a
hospital.  Doctors prescribed hormones to control the flow of blood,
and my sister and I gave her the injections.  My mother knew it was
dangerous to depend on hormones, but there was no alternative.  It was
the only way she could get through the denunciation meetings.

In the meantime, the Rebels in my father's department stepped up their
assaults on him.  Being one of the most important in the provincial
government, the depa~isuent had more than its share of opportunists.
Formerly obedient instruments of the old Party system, many now became
fiercely militant Rebels, led by Mrs.  Shall under the banner of 26
August.

One day, a group of them barged into our apariment and marched into my
father's study.  They looked at the bookshelves, and declared him a
real 'diehard' because he still had his 'reactionary books."  Earlier,
in the wake of the book burning by the teenage Red Guards, many people
had set fire to their collections.  But not my father.  Now he made a
faint attempt to protect his books by pointing at the sets of Marxist
hardbacks.

"Don't try to fool us Red Guards!"  yelled Mrs.  Shau.

"You have plenty of "poisonous weeds"!"  She picked up some Chinese
classics printed on flimsy rice paper.

"What do you mean, "us Red Guards"?"  my father retorted.

"You are old enough to be their mother and you ought to have more
sense, too."

Mrs.  Shau slapped my father hard.  The crowd barked at him
indignantly, although a few tried to hide their giggles Then they
pulled out his books and threw them into huge jute sacks they had
brought with them.  When all the bags were full, they carried them
downstairs, telling my father they were going to burn them on the
grounds of the department the next day after a denunciation meeting
against him.  They ordered him to watch the bonfire 'to be taught a
lesson."  In the meantime, they said, he must burn the rest of his
collection.

When I came home that afternoon, I found my father in the kitchen.  He
had lit a fire in the big cement sink, and was hurling his books into
the flames.

This was the first time in my life I had seen him weeping.

It was agonized, broken, and wild, the weeping of a man who was not
used to shedding tears.  Every now and then, in fits of violent sobs,
he stamped his feet on the floor and banged his head against the
wall.

I was so frightened that for some time I did not dare to do anything to
comfort him.  Eventually I put my arms around him and held him from the
back, but I did not know what to say.  He did not utter a word either.
My father had spent every spare penny on his books.  They were his
life.  After the bonfire, I could tell that something had happened to
his mind.

He had to go to many denunciation meetings.  Mrs.  Shau and her group
usually got a large number of Rebels from outside to increase the size
of the crowd and to lend a hand in the violence.  A standard opening
was to chant:

"Ten thousand years, another ten thousand years, and yet another ten
thousand years to our Great Teacher, Great Leader, Great Commander, and
Great Helmsman Chairman Mao!"  Each time the three 'ten thousand's and
four 'great's were shouted out, everyone raised their Litfie Red Books
in unison.  My father would not do this.  He said that the 'ten
thousand years' was how emperors used to be addressed, and it was
unfitting for Chairman Mao, a Communisc

This brought down a torrent of hysterical yells and slaps.

At one meeting, all the targets were ordered to kneel and kowtow to a
huge portrait of Mao at the back of the platform.  While the others did
as they were told, my father refused.  He said that kneeling and
kowtowing were undignified feudal practices which the Communists were
committed to eliminating.  The Rebels screamed, kicked his knees, and
struck him on the head, but he still struggled to stand upright.

"I will not kneel!  I will not kowtowl' he said furiously.  The enraged
crowd demanded, "Bow your head and admit your crimes!"  He replied, "I
have committed no crime.  I will not bend my head!"

Several large young men jumped on him to try to force him down, but as
soon as they let go he stood up straight, raised his head, and stared
defiantly at the audience.  His assailants yanked his hair and pulled
his neck.  My father struggled fiercely.  As the hysterical crowd
screamed that he was 'anti-Culttu'al Revolution," he shouted angrily,
"What kind of Cultural Revolution is this?  There is nothing "cultural"
about it!  There is only brutality!"

The men who were beating him howled, "The Cultural Revolution is led by
Chairman Mao!  How dare you oppose it?"  My father raised his voice
higher: "I do oppose it, even if it is led by Chairman Mao!"

There was total silence.

"Opposing Chairman Mao' was a crime punishable by death.  Many people
had died simply because they had been accused of it, without any
evidence.

The Rebels were stunned to see that my father did not seem to be
afraid.  After they recovered from their initial shock, they began to
beat him again, calling on him to withdraw his blasphemous words.  He
refused.  Enraged, they tied him up and dragged him to the local
police, demanding that they arrest him.  But the policemen there would
not take him.  They liked law and order and Party officials, and hated
the Rebels.  They said they needed permission to arrest an official as
senior as my father, and no one had given such an order.

My father was to be beaten up repeatedly.  But he stuck to his guns. He
was the only person in the compound to behave like this, indeed the
only one I knew of at all, and many people, including Rebels, secretly
admired him.

Every now and then a complete stranger passing us in the street would
murmur stealthily how my father had impressed them.  Some boys told my
brothers they wanted to have bones as strong as my father's.

After their day's torment, both my parents would come home to my
grandmother's nursing hand.  By then, she had set aside her resentment
of my father, and he had also mellowed toward her.  She applied
ointment to his wounds, stuck on special poultices to reduce his
bruising, and got him to drink potions made with a white powder called
bai-yao to help cure his internal injuries.

My parents were under permanent orders to stay at home and wait to be
summoned to the next meeting.  Going into hiding was out of the
question.  The whole of China was like a prison.  Every house, every
street was watched by the people themselves.  In this vast land, there
was nowhere anyone could hide.

My parents could not go out for relaxation either.

"Relaxation' had become an obsolete concept: books, paintings, musical
instruments, sports, cards, chess, teahouses, bars all had disappeared.
The parks were desolate, vandalized wastelands in which the flowers and
the grass had been uprooted and the tame birds and goldfish killed.
Films, plays, and concerts had all been banned: Mme Mao had cleared the
stages and the screens for the eight 'revolutionary operas' which she
had had a hand in producing, and which were all anyone was allowed to
put on.  In the provinces, people did not dare to perform even these. 
One director had been condemned because the makeup he had put on the
torn red hero of one of the operas was considered by Mme Mao to be
excessive.  He was thrown into prison for 'exaggerating the hardship in
the revolutionary struggle."  We hardly even thought of going out for a
walk.

The atmosphere outside was terrifying, with the violent street-corner
denunciation meetings and all the sinister wall posters and slogans;
people were walking around like zombies, with harsh or cowed
expressions on their faces.

What was more, my parents' bruised faces marked them as condemned, and
if they went out they ran the risk of being abused.

As an indication of the terror of the day, no one dared to burn or
throw away any newspapers.  Every front page carried Mao's portrait,
and every few lines featured Mao's quotations.  These papers had to be
treasured and it would bring disaster if anyone saw you disposing of
them.  Keeping them was also a problem: mice might gnaw into Mao's
portrait, or the papers might simply rot either of these would be
interpreted as a crime against Mao.  Indeed, the first large-scale
factional fighting in Chengdu was triggered by some Red Guards
accidentally sitting on old newspapers which had Mao's face on them.  A
schoolfriend of my mother's was hounded to suicide because she wrote
"Heartily love Chairman Mao' on a wall poster with one brush stroke
inadvertently shorter, making the character 'heartily' look like the
one meaning 'sadly."

One day in February 1967, in the depths of this overwhelming terror, my
parents had a long conversation which I only came to know about years
later.  My mother was sitting on the edge of their bed, and my father
was in a wicker chair opposite.  He told her that he now knew what the
Cultural Revolution was really about, and the realization had shattered
his whole world.  He could see clearly that it had nothing to do with
democratization, or with giving ordinary people more say.  It was a
bloody purge to increase Mao's personal power.

My father talked slowly and deliberately, choosing his words
carefully.

"But Chairman Mao has always been so magnanimous," my mother said.

"He even spared Pu Yi.

Why can't he tolerate his comrades-in-arms who fought for a new China
with him?  How can he be so harsh on them?"

My father said quietly, but intensely, "What was Pu Yi?

He was a war criminal, with no support from the people.

He couldn't do anything.  But..."  He fell into a meaningful silence.
My mother understood him: Mao would not tolerate any possible
challenge.  Then she asked, "But why all of us, who after all only
carry out orders?  And why incriminate all these innocent people?  And
so much destruction and suffering?"

My father replied, "Maybe Chairman Mao feels he could not achieve his
goal without turning the whole place upside down.  He has always been
thorough and he has never been fainthearted about casualties."

After a charged pause, my father went on: "This cannot be a revolution
in any sense of the term.  To secure personal power at such cost to the
country and the people has to be wrong.  In fact, I think it is
criminal."

My mother scented disaster.  After reasoning like this, her husband had
to act.  As she expected, he said, "I am going to write a letter to
Chairman Mao."

My mother dropped her head into her hands.

"What's the use?"  she burst out.

"How could you possibly imagine Chairman Mao would listen to you?  Why
do you want to destroy yourself- and for nothing?  Don't count on me to
take it to Peking this time!"

My father leaned over and kissed her.

"I wasn't thinking about your delivering it.  I'm going to post it."
Then he lifted her head and looked into her eyes.  In a tone of despair
he said, 'what else can I do?  what alternatives do I have?  I must
speak up.  It might help.  And I must do it even if just for my
conscience."

"Why is your conscience so important?"  my mother said.

"More than your children?  Do you want them to become "blacks"?"

There was a long pause.  Then my father said hesitantly, "I suppose you
must divorce me and bring up the children your way."  Silence fell
between them again, making her think that perhaps he had not made up
his mind about writing the letter, because he was aware of its
consequences.  It would surely be catastrophic.

Days passed.  In late February, an airplane flew low over Chengdu
spreading thousands of sparkling sheets which floated down out of the
leaden sky.  On them was printed a copy of a letter dated 17 February
and signed by the Central Military Committee, the top body of senior
army men.  The letter told the Rebels to desist from their violent
actions.  Although it did not condemn the Cultural Revolution directly,
it was obviously trying to halt it.  A colleague showed the leaflet to
my mother.  My parents had a surge of hope.  Perhaps China's old and
much-respected marshals were going to intervene.  There was a big
demonstration through the streets of central Chengdu in support of the
marshals' call.

The leaflets were the result of upheavals behind closed doors in
Peking.  In late January Mao had for the first time called on the army
to support the Rebels.  Most of the top military leaders except Defense
Minister Lin Biao were furious.  On 14 and 16 February, they held two
long meetings with political leaders.  Mao himself stayed away, as did
Lin Biao, his deputy.  Zhou Enlai presided.  The marshals joined forces
with Politburo members who had not yet been purged.  These marshals had
been the commanders of the Communist army, veterans of the Long March,
and heroes of the revolution.  They condemned the Cultural Revolution
for persecuting innocent people and destabilizing the country.  One of
the vice-premiers, Tan Zhenlin, burst out in a fury, "I've followed
Chairman Mao all my life.  Now I'm not following him anymore!"
Immediately after these meetings the marshals began to take steps to
try to stop the violence.  Because it was particularly bad in Sichuan,
they issued the letter of 17 February especially for the province.

Zhou Enlai declined to throw his weight behind the majority, and stuck
with Mao.  The personality cult had endowed Mao with demonic power.
Retribution against

!:

the opposition was swift.  Mao stage-managed mob attacks on the
dissident Politburo members and military commanders, who were subjected
to house raids and brutal denunciation meetings.  When Mao gave the
word to punish the marshals, the army did not make a move to support
them.

This single feeble attempt to stand up to Mao and his Cultural
Revolution was termed the "February Adverse Current."  The regime
released a selective account of it to generate more intense violence
against the capitalistroaders.

The February meetings were a turning point for Mao.

He saw that virtually everyone opposed his policies.  This led to the
total discarding in all but name of the Party.

The Politburo was effectively replaced by the Cultural Revolution
Authority.  Lin Biao soon began to purge commanders loyal to the
marshals, and the role of the Central Military Committee was taken over
by his personal office, which he controlled through his wife.  Mao's
cabal now was like a medieval court, structured around wives, cousins,
and fawning courtiers.  Mao sent delegates to the provinces to organize
"Revolutionary Committees," which were to be the new instruments of his
personal power, replacing the Party system all the way down to the
grass roots.

In Sichuan, Mao's delegates turned out to be my parents' old
acquaintances, the Tings.  After my family had left Yibin, the Tings
had practically taken control of the region.  Mr.  Ting had become its
Party secretary; Mrs.  Ting was Party chief of the city of Yibin, the
capital.

The Tings had used their positions to engage in endless persecutions
and personal vendettas.  One involved a man who had been Mrs.  Ting's
bodyguard in the early 195os.

She had tried to seduce him several times, and one day she complained
about having stomach trouble and got the young man to massage her
abdomen.  Then she guided his hand down to her private parts.  The
bodyguard immediately pulled his hand back and walked away.  Mrs.  Ting
accused him of trying to rape her and had him sentenced to three years
in a labor camp.

An anonymous letter exposing the whole affair reached the Sichuan Party
Committee, which ordered an investigation.  Being the defendants, the
Tings were not supposed to see this letter, but a crony of theirs
showed it to them.

They got every member of the Yibin government to write a report on some
issue or other in order to check their handwriting.  They were never
able to identify the author, but the investigation came to nothing.

In Yibin, officials and ordinary people alike were terrified of the
Tings.  The recurrent political campaigns and the quota system provided
ideal opportunities for them to engage in victimization.

In 1959 the Tings got rid of the governor of Yibin, the man who had
succeeded my father in 1953.  He was a veteran of the Long March, and
was very popular, which made the Tings'envious.  He was called "Straw
Sandal Li' because he always wore peasant's sandals a sign that he
wanted to keep close to his roots in the soil.  Indeed, during the
Great Leap Forward, he showed little alacrity in forcing the peasants
to produce steel, and in 1959 he spoke up about the famine.  The Tings
denounced him as a 'rightist opportunist' and had him demoted to
purchasing agent for the canteen of a brewery.  He died in the famine,
although his job should have meant he had a better opportunity to fill
his stomach than most.  The autopsy showed there was only straw in his
stomach.  He had remained an honest man to his death.

Another case, also in 1959, involved a doctor whom the Tings condemned
as a class enemy because he made a truthful diagnosis of hunger victims
and the famine was officially unmentionable.

There were scores of cases like these so many that people risked their
lives to write to the provincial authorities to denounce the Tings.  In
1962, when the moderates had the upper hand in the central government,
they launched a nationwide investigation into the previous campaigns
and rehabilitated many of the victims.  A team was formed by the
Sichuan government to investigate the Tings, who were found guilty of
gross abuse of power.

They were sacked and detained, and in 1965 General Secretary Deng
Xiaoping signed an order expelling them from the Party.

When the Cultural Revolution started, the Tings somehow escaped and got
to Peking, where they appealed to the Cultural Revolution Authority.
They presented themselves as heroes upholding 'class struggle," for
which, they claimed, they had been persecuted by the old Party
authorities.  My mother actually bumped into them once at the grievance
office.  They asked her warmly for her address in Peking.  She declined
to give it to them.

The Tings were picked up by Chen Boda, one of the leaders of the
Cultural Revolution Authority, and my father's old boss in Yan'an.
Through him, Mme Mao received them, and immediately recognized them as
kindred spirits.  Mme Mao's motivation for the Cultural Revolution had
much less to do with policy than with set fling personal scores some of
the pettiest kind.  She had a hand in the persecution of Mme Liu Shaoqi
because, as she herself told the Red Guards, she was furious about Mme
Liu's overseas trips with her husband, the president.  Mao only went
abroad twice, both times to Russia, and both times without Mme Mao.
What was worse, on her trips abroad Mme Liu was seen wearing smart
clothes and jewelry that no one could wear in Mao's austere China.

Mme Liu was accused of being a CIA agent and thrown into prison, barely
escaping death.

Back in the 193os, before she had met Mao, Mme Mao had been a minor
actress in Shanghai, and had felt cold-shouldered by the lite raft
there.  Some of them were Communist underground leaders, who after 1949
became leading figures in the Central Department of Public Affairs.
Partly to avenge her real or imagined humiliation in

Shanghai thirty years before, Mme Mao went to extreme lengths to find
'anti-Chairman Mao, anti-socialist' elements in their work.  As Mao
went into retreat during the famine, she managed to get closer to him
and whispered much venomous pillow talk in his ear.  In order to bring
her foes down, she condemned the entire system under them, which meant
the departments of Public Affairs all over the country.

She also took revenge on actors and actresses from the Shanghai period
who had aroused her jealousy.  An actress called Wang Ying had played a
role which Mme Mao had coveted.  Thirty years later, in 1966, Mme Mao
had her and her husband imprisoned for life.  Wang Ying committed
suicide in prison in 1974.

Another well-known actress, Sun Wei-shi, had once appeared decades
before with Mine Mao in a play in Yan'an in front of Mao.  Sun's
performance was apparently more of a hit than Mme Mao's, and she became
a very popular figure among the top leaders, including Mao.

Being Zhou Enlai's adopted daughter, she did not feel the need to
butter up Mme Mao.  In 1968, Mme Mao had her and her brother arrested
and tortured to death.  Even Zhou Enlai's power could not protect
her.

Mme Mao's vendettas gradually became known to the general public by
word of mouth; her character also revealed itself in her speeches,
which were reproduced on wall posters.  She was to become almost
universally hated, but at the beginning of 1967 her evils were still
little known.

Mme Mao and the Tings belonged to the same breed, who had a name in
Mao's China -zheng-ren, people persecuting officials."  The
tirelessness and single mindedness with which they engaged in
persecution, and the bloodthirsty methods they used, were on a truly
horrific scale.  In March 1967, a document signed by Mao announced that
the Tings had been rehabilitated and empowered to organize the Sichuan
Revolutionary Committee.

A transitional authority called the Sichuan Preparatory

Revolutionary Committee was set up.  It was composed of two generals
the chief political commissar and the commander of the Chengdu Military
Region (one of

China's eight military regions) and the Tings.  Mao had decreed that
every Revolutionary Committee should have three components: the local
army, representatives of the

Rebels, and 'revolutionary officials."  The latter were to be chosen
from among former officials, and this was at the discretion of the
Tings, who were in effect running the committee.

In late March 1967 the Tings came to see my father.

They wanted to include him in their committee.  My father enjoyed high
prestige among his colleagues for being honest and fair.  Even the
Tings appreciated his qualities, particularly as they knew that when
they had been in disgrace my father had not, like some, added his
personal denunciations.  Besides, they needed someone with his
abilities.

My father greeted them as courtesy required, but my 'grandmother
welcomed them with enthusiasm.  She had heard lit He about their
vendettas, and she knew that it was Mrs.  Ting who had authorized the
precious American medicines which had cured my mother of TB when she
was pregnant with me.

When the Tings went into my father's quarters, my grandmother quickly
rolled out some dough, and soon the loud rhythmic melody of chopping
filled the kitchen.  She minced pork, cut a bundle of tender young
chives, hashed an assortment of spices, and poured hot rapeseed oil
onto chili powder to make the sauce for the traditional welcoming meal
of dumplings.

In my father's study, the Tings told him about their rehabilitation and
their new status.  They said they had been to his deparisaaent and been
briefed by the Rebels there about the trouble he had gotten himself
into.  However, they said, they had always liked him in those early
years in Yibin, still had high regard for him, and wanted to work with
him again.  They promised that all the incriminating things he had said
and done could be forgotten if he cooperated.  Not only that, he could
rise again in the new power structure, taking charge of all cultural
affairs in Sichuan, for example.  They made it clear it was an offer he
could not afford to refuse.

My father had heard about the Tings' appointment from my mother, who
had read it on wall posters.  He had said to my mother at the time: "We
mustn't believe in rumors.

This is impossible!"  It was incredible to him to see this couple
placed in vital positions by Mao.  Now he tried to restrain his
disgust, and said, "I'm sorry, I can't accept your offer."

Mrs.  Ting snapped, "We are doing you a big favor.  Other people would
have begged for this on their knees.  Do you realize what a spot you
are in, and who we are now?"

My father's anger rose.  He said, "Whatever I have said or done I take
responsibility for myself.  I do not want to get mixed up with you." In
the heated exchanges that followed, he went on to say that he thought
their punishment had been just, and they should never have been trusted
with important jobs.  Stunned, they told ~ to be careful what he said:
it was Chairman Mao himself who had rehabilitated them and had called
them 'good officials."

My father's outrage spurred him on.

"But Chairman Mao could not have known all the facts about you.  What
sort of' good officials" are you?  You have committed unforgivable
mistakes."  He checked himself from saying 'crimes."

"How dare you challenge Chairman Mao's words!"

exclaimed Mrs.  Ting.

"Deputy Commander Lin Biao said:

"Every word of Chairman Mao's is universal absolute truth, and every
word equals ten thousand words"!"

"If a word means one word," my father said, 'it is already a man's
supreme achievement.  It is not humanly possible for one word to mean
ten thousand.  What Deputy Commander Lin Biao said was rhetorical, and
should not be taken literally."

The Tings could not believe their ears, according to their account
afterward.  They warned my father that his way of thinking, talking,
and behaving was against the Cultural Revolution, which was led by
Chairman Mao.  To this my father said he would like a chance to debate
with Chairman Mao about the whole thing.  These words were so suicidal
that the Tings were speechless.  After a silence, they stood up to
leave.

My grandmother heard angry footsteps and rushed out of the kitchen, her
hands dusted with wheat flour into which she had been dipping the
dumplings.  She collided with Mrs.  Ting and asked the couple to stay
for lunch.

Mrs.  Ting ignored her, stormed out of the apartment, and started to
tramp downstairs.  At the landing she stopped, turned around, and said
furiously to my father, who had come out with them, "Are you crazy? I'm
asking you for the last time: Do you still refuse my help?  You realize
I can do anything to you now."

"I want nothing to do with you," my father said.

"You and I are different species."

Leaving my star fled and fearful grandmother at the top of the stairs,
my father went into his study.  He came out almost at once, and carried
an ink stone to the bathroom.

He dripped a few drops of water onto the stone and walked thoughtfully
back into the study.  Then he sat down at his desk, and started
grinding a stick of ink round and round the stone, forming a thick
black liquid.  He spread a blank sheet of paper in front of him.  In no
time, he had finished his second letter to Mao.  He started by saying:
"Chairman Mao, I appeal to you, as one Communist to another, to stop
the Cultural Revolution."  He went on to describe the disasters into
which it had thrown China.  The letter ended with the words: "I fear
the worst for our Party and our country if people like Liu Jie-ting and
Zhang Xi-ting are given power over the lives of tens of millions of
people."

He addressed the envelope to "Chairman Mao, Peking," and took it to the
post office at the top of the street.  He sent it by registered
airmail.  The clerk behind the counter took the envelope and glanced at
it, maintaining an expression of total blankness.  Then my father
walked home to wait.

20.  '1 Will Not Sell My Soul' My Father Arrested

(1967-1968)

On the afternoon of the third day after my father posted his letter to
Mao, my mother answered a knock on the door of our apartment.  Three
men came in, all wearing the same baggy blue uniform like clothes as
every other man in China.  My father knew one of them: he had been a
caretaker in his department and was a militant Rebel.

One of the others, a tall man with boils on his thin face, announced
that they were Rebels from the police and that they had come to arrest
him, 'a counterrevolutionary in action bombarding Chairman Mao and the
Cultural Revolution."  Then he and the third man, who was shorter and
stouter, gripped my father by the arms, and gestured to him to go.

They did not show any identity cards, much less an arrest warrant.  But
there was no doubt that they were Rebel plainclothes policemen.  Their
authority was unquestionable, because they came with a Rebel from my
father's department.

Although they did not mention his letter to Mao, my father knew it must
have been intercepted, as was almost inevitable.  He had known that he
would probably be arrested, because not only had he committed his
blasphemy to paper, but there was now an authority the Tings to
sanction his arrest.  Even so, he had wanted to take the only chance
there was, however slight.  He was silent and tense, but did not
protest.  As he was walking out of the apartment, he paused and said
softly to my mother: "Don't bear a grudge against our Party.  Have
faith that it will correct its mistakes, however grave they may be.
Divorce me and give my love to our children.  Don't alarm them."

When I came home later that afternoon, I found both of my parents gone.
My grandmother told me my mother had gone to Peking to appeal for my
father, who had been taken away by Rebels from his par anent  She did
not say 'the police," because that would have been too frightening,
being more disastrous and final than detention by Rebels.

I rushed to my father's deparl,nent to ask where he was.

I got no answer except assorted barks, led by Mrs.  Shau, of "You must
draw a line from your stinking capitalist-roader father' and "Wherever
he is, it serves him right."  I forced back my furious tears.  I was
filled with loathing for these supposedly intelligent adults.  They did
not have to be so merciless, so brutal.  A kinder look, a gentler tone,
or even silence would have been perfectly possible, even in those
days.

It was from this time that I developed my way of judging the Chinese by
dividing them into two kinds: one humane, and one not.  It took an
upheaval like the Cultural Revolution to bring out these
characteristics in people, whether they were teenage Red Guards, adult
Rebels, or capitalistroaders.

Meanwhile, my mother was waiting at the station for the train that was
to take her to Peking a second time.  She felt much more despondent now
than six months before.

There had still been a chance for some justice then, but it was
virtually hopeless now.  My mother did not give in to despair.  She was
determined to fight.

She had decided that the one person she had to see was

L~

Premier Zhou Enlai.  No one else would do.  If she sa~ anyone else it
would only hasten the demise of her husband, herself, and her family.
She knew that Zhou was tar more moderate than Mme Mao and the Cultural
Revolution Authority and that he exercised considerable power over the
Rebels, to whom he gave orders almost even' day.

But getting to see him was like trying to walk into the White House, or
see the Pope alone.  Even if she reached Peking without being caught,
and got to the right grievance office, she could not specify whom she
wanted to see, as that would be taken as an insult to, even an attack
on, other leaders.  Her anxiety grew, and she did not know whether her
absence from home had already been discovered by the Rebels.  She was
meant to be waiting to be summoned to her next denunciation meeting,
but there was a possible loophole.  One Rebel group might think she was
in the hands of another.

As she waited, she saw a huge banner with the words "The Red Chengdu
Petition Delegation to Peking."  Clustered around it was a crowd of
about 200 people in their early twenties.  Their other banners made it
clear they were university students, going to Peking to protest against
the Tings.  What was more, the banners proclaimed that they had secured
a meeting with Premier Zhou.

Compared with its rival Rebel group, 26 August, Red Chengdu was
relatively moderate.  The Tings had thrown their weight behind 26
August, but Red Chengdu did not surrender.  The power of the Tings was
never absolute, even though they were backed by Mao and the Cultural
Revolution Authority.

At this time, the Cultural Revolution was dominated by intense
factional fighting between Rebel groups.  This had begun almost as soon
as Mao had given the signal to seize power from the capitalist-roaders;
now, three months later, most of the Rebel leaders were emerging as
something very different from the ousted Communist officials: they were
undisciplined opportunists, and were not even fanatical Maoists.  Mao
had instructed them to unite and share power, but they only paid lip
service to this injunction.

They verbally attacked each other with Mao's quotations, making cynical
use of his guru-like elusiveness it was easy to select a quotation of
Mao's to suit any situation, or even both sides of the same argument.
Mao knew that his vapid 'philosophy' was boomeranging on him, but he
could not intervene explicitly without losing his mystical
remoteness.

In order to destroy 26 August, Red Chengdu knew it had to bring down
the Tings.  They knew the Tings' reputation for vindictiveness and
their lust for power, which were widely discussed, in hushed tones by
some, more openly by others.  Even Mao's endorsement of the couple was
not enough to get Red Chengdu to fall into line.  It was against this
background that Red Chengdu was sending the students to Peking.  Zhou
Enlai had promised to receive them because Red Chengdu, as one of the
two Rebel camps in Sichuan, had millions of supporters.

My mother followed the Red Chengdu crowd as they were waved through the
ticket barrier onto the platform where the Peking express was puffing.
She was trying to climb into a carriage with them when she was stopped
by a male student.

"Who are you?"  he shouted.  My mother, at thirty-five, hardly looked
like a student.

"You're not one of us.  Get off{'

My mother clung tightly to the handle of the door.

"I am going to Peking, too, to appeal against the Tings{' she cried.

"I know them from the past."  The man looked at her in disbelief.  But
from behind him came two voices, a man's and a woman's: "Let her in{
Let's hear what she has to say{'

My mother squeezed into the packed compartment, and was seated between
the man and the woman.  They introduced themselves as staff officers of
Red Chengdu.  The man was called Yong, and the woman Yan.  They were
both students at Chengdu University.

j~

From what they said, my mother could see that the students did not know
very much about the Tings.  She told them what she could remember about
some of the many cases of persecution in Yibin before the Cultural
Revolution; about Mrs.  Ting's attempt to seduce my father in 1953; the
couple's recent visit to my father, and his refusal to collaborate with
them.  She said the Tings had had my father arrested because he had
written to Chairman Mao to oppose their appointment as the new leaders
of Sichuan.

Yan and Yong promised they would take her to their meeting with Zhou
Enlai.  All night, my mother sat wide awake planning what she should
say to him, and how.

When the delegation arrived at Peking Station, a representative of the
premier was waiting for them.  They were taken to a government
guesthouse, and told that Zhou would see them the next evening.

The next day, while the students were out, my mother prepared a written
plea to Zhou.  She might not get a chance to talk to him, and in any
case it was better to petition him in writing.  At 9 p.m. she went with
the students to the Great Hall of the People on the west side of
Tiananmen Square.  The meeting was in the Sichuan Room, which my father
had helped decorate in 1959.  The students sat in an arc facing the
premier.  There were not enough seats, so some sat on the carpeted
floor.  My mother sat in the back row.

She knew her speech had to be succinct and effective, and she rehearsed
it again in her head as the meeting got under way.  She was too
preoccupied to hear what the students were saying.  She only noted how
the premier reacted.  Every now and then he nodded acknowledgment.

He never indicated approval or disagreement.  He just listened, and
occasionally made general remarks about 'following Chairman Mao' and
'the need to unite."  An aide took notes.

Suddenly she heard the premier saying, as though in conclusion:
"Anything else?"  She shot up from her seat.

"Premier, I have something to say."

Zhou raised his eyes.  My mother was obviously not a student.

"Who are you?"  he asked.  My mother gave her name and position, and
followed immediately with: "My husband has been arrested as a
"counterrevolutionary in action."  I am here to seek justice for him."
She then gave my father's name and position.

Zhou's eyes became intent.  My father had an important position.

"The students can go," he said.

"I'll talk to you privately."

My mother longed to talk to Zhou alone, but she had decided to
sacrifice this chance for a more important goal.

"Premier, I would like the students to stay to be my witnesses."  While
saying this, she handed her petition to the student in front, who
passed it on to Zhou.

The premier nodded: "All right.  Go ahead."

Quickly but clearly, my mother said my father had been arrested for
what he had written in a letter to Chairman Mao.  My father disagreed
with the Tings' appointment as the new leaders of Sichuan, because of
their record of abuse of power which he had witnessed in Yibin.  Apart
from that, she said briefly: "My husband's letter also contained
serious mistakes about the Cultural Revolution."

She had thought carefully about how she would put this.

She had to give a true account to Zhou, but she could not repeat my
father's exact words for fear of the Rebels.  She had to be as abstract
as possible: "My husband held some seriously erroneous views.  However,
he did not spread his views in public.  He was following the charter of
the Communist Party and speaking his mind to Chairman Mao.  According
to the charter, this is the legitimate right of a Party member, and
should not be used as an excuse to arrest him.  I am here to appeal for
justice for him."

When my mother's eyes met Zhou Enlai's, she saw that he had fully
understood the real content of my father's letter, and her dilemma of
not being able to spell it out.

He glanced at my mother's petition, then turned to an aide sitting
behind him and whispered something.  The hall was deadly quiet.  All
eyes were on the premier.

The aide handed Zhou some sheets of paper with the letterhead of the
State Council (the cabinet).  Zhou started writing in his slightly
strained way his right arm had been broken years before when he fell
from a horse in Yan'an.

When he finished, he gave the paper to the aide, who read it out.

'"One: As a Communist Party member, Chang Shou-yu is entitled to write
to the Party leadership.  No matter what serious mistakes the letter
contains, it may not be used to accuse him of being a
counterrevolutionary.  Two: As Deputy Director of the Depaximent of
Public Affairs of Sichuan Province, Chang Shou-yu has to submit himself
to investigation and criticism by the people.  Three: Any final
adjudication on Chang Shou-yu must wait fill the end of the Cultural
Revolution.  Zhou Enlai."

My mother was speechless with relief.  The note was not addressed to
the new leaders in Sichuan, which would normally have been the case, so
she was not bound to hand it in to them, or to anyone.  Zhou intended
her to keep it and show it to whoever might prove useful.

Yan and Yong were sitting on my mother's left.  When she turned to
them, she saw they were beaming with joy.

She caught the train back to Chengdu two days later, keeping with Yan
and Yong all the time, as she was worried the Tings might get wind of
the note and send their henchmen to grab it and her.  Yan and Yong also
thought it was vital for her to stick with them, "In case z6 August
abducts you."  They insisted on accompanying her to our apactment from
the station.  My grandmother gave them pork-and chive pancakes, which
they devoured in no time.

I immediately took to Yan and Yong.  Rebels, and yet so kind, so
friendly and warm to my family!  It was unbelievable.  I could also
tell at once that they were in love: the way they glanced at each
other, the way they teased and touched each other, was very unusual in
company.  I heard my grandmother sigh to my mother that it would be
nice to give them some presents for their wedding.  My mother said this
would be impossible, and would get them into trouble if it became
known.  Accepting 'bribes' from a capitalist-roader was no small
offense.

Yan was twenty-four, and had been in her third year studying accounting
at Chengdu University.  Her lively face was dominated by a pair of
thick-rimmed spectacles.  She laughed frequently, throwing her head
back.  It was a very heart-warming laugh.  In China in those days,
dark-blue or gray jacket and trousers were the standard gear for men,
women, and children.  No pan ems were allowed.  In spite of the
uniformity, some women managed to wear their clothes with signs of care
and thoughtfulness.  But not Yan.

She always looked as though she had put her buttons in the wrong holes,
and her short hair was pulled back impatiently into an untidy tail.  It
seemed that not even being in love could induce her to pay attention to
her looks.

Yong looked more fashion conscious.  He wore a pair of straw sandals,
which were set off by rolled-up trouser legs.

Straw sandals were a sort of fashion among some students because of
their association with the peasants.  Yong seemed exceedingly
intelligent and sensitive.  I was fascinated by him.

After a happy meal, Yan and Yong took their leave.  My mother walked
downstairs with them, and they whispered to her that she must keep Zhou
Enlai's note in a safe place.

My mother said nothing to me or my siblings about her meeting with
Zhou.

That evening, my mother went to see an old colleague of hers and showed
him Zhou's note.  Chen Mo had worked with my parents in Yibin in the
early 195os, and got on well with both of them.  He had also managed to
maintain a good relationship with the Tings, and when they were
rehabilitated he threw in his lot with them.  My

3/I3, Father:~Irrested 46 l mother asked him, in tears, to help secure
my father's release for old times' sake, and he promised to have a word
with the Tings.

Time passed, and then, in April, my father suddenly reappeared.  I was
tremendously relieved and happy to see him, but almost immediately my
joy turned to horror.

There was a strange light in his eyes.  He would not say where he had
been, and when he did speak, I could hardly understand his words.  He
was sleepless for days and nights on end, and paced up and down the
apartment, talking to himself.  One day he forced the whole family to
go and stand in the pouring rain, telling us this was 'to experience
the revolutionary storm."  Another day, after collecting his salary
packet, he threw it into the kitchen stove, saying that this was 'to
break with private property."  The dreadful truth dawned on us: my
father had gone insane.

My mother became the focus of his madness.  He raged at her, calling
her 'shameless," 'a coward," and accusing her of 'selling her soul."
Then, without warning, he would become embarrassingly loving toward her
in front of the rest of us saying over and over again how much he loved
her, how he had been an unworthy husband, and begging her to 'forgive
me and come back to me."

On his first day back he had looked at my mother suspiciously and asked
her what she had been doing.  She told him she had been to Peking to
appeal for his release.  He shook his head incredulously, and asked her
to produce evidence.  She decided not to tell him about the note from
Zhou Enlai.  She could see he was not himself, and was worried he might
hand in the note, even to the Tings, if 'the Party' ordered him to. She
could not even name Yan and Yong as her witnesses: my father would
think it was wrong to get involved with a Red Guard faction.

He kept coming back to the issue obsessively.  Every day he would
cross-examine my mother, and apparent inconsistencies emerged in her
story.  My father's suspicion and confusion grew.  His rage toward my
mother began to verge on violence.  My siblings and I wanted to help my
mother, and tried to make her story, about which we were vague
ourselves, sound more convincing.  Of course, when my father started to
question us, it became even more muddled.

What had happened was that while my father was in prison, his
interrogators had constantly told him he would be deserted by his wife
and family if he did not write his 'confession."  Insisting on
confessions was a standard practice.  Forcing victims to admit their
'guilt' was vital in crushing their morale.  But my father said he had
nothing to confess, and would not write anything.

His interrogators then told him that my mother had denounced him.  When
he asked for her to be allowed to visit him, he was told she had been
given permission, but had refused, to show that she was 'drawing a
line' between herself and him.  When the interrogators realized that my
father was beginning to hear things a sign of schizophrenia- they drew
his attention to a faint buzz of conversation from the next room,
saying that my mother was in there, but would not see him unless he
wrote his confession.  The interrogators play-acted so vividly that my
father thought he really heard my mother's voice.  His mind began to
collapse.  Still he would not write the confession.

As he was being released, one of his interrogators told him he was
being allowed home to be kept under the eyes of his wife, 'who has been
assigned by the Party to watch you."  Home, he was told, was to be his
new prison.  He did not know the reason for his sudden release, and in
his confusion he latched onto this explanation.

My mother knew nothing about what had happened to him in prison.  When
my father asked her why he had been released, she could not give him a
satisfactory answer.  Not only could she not tell him about Zhou
Enlai's note, she could not mention going to see Chen Mo, who was the
right-hand man of the Tings.  My father would not have tolerated his
wife's 'begging for a favor' from the Tings.

In this vicious circle, both my mother's dilemma and my father's
insanity grew, and fed off each other.

My mother tried to get medical treatment for him.  She went to the
clinic that had been attached to the old provincial government.  She
tried the mental hospitals.  But as soon as the people at the
registration desks heard my father's name, they shook their heads. They
could not take him without sanction from the authorities and they were
not prepared to ask for that themselves.

My mother went to the dominant Rebel group in my father's department
and asked them to authorize hospitalization.  This was the group led by
Mrs.  Shau, and firmly in the hands of the Tings.  Mrs.  Shau snarled
at my mother that my father was faking mental illness in order to
escape his punishment, and that my mother was helping him, using her
own medical background (her stepfather, Dr.  Xia, having been a
doctor).  My father was 'a dog that has fallen into the water, and must
be flogged and beaten with absolutely no charity," said one Rebel,
quoting a current slogan vaunting the merciless ness of the Cultural
Revolution.

Under instructions from the Tings, the Rebels hounded my father with a
wall-poster campaign.  Apparently, the Tings had reported to Mme Mao
the 'criminal words' my father had used at the denunciation meeting, in
his conversation with them, and in his letter to Mao.  According to the
posters, Mme Mao had risen to her feet in indignation and said, "For
the man who dares to attack the Great Leader so blatantly,
imprisonment, even the death sentence, is too kind!  He must be
thoroughly punished before we have done with him!"

The terror such wall posters induced in me was immense.  Mme Mao had
denounced my father!  This was surely the end for him.  But,
paradoxically, one of Mme Mao's evil traits was actually to help us:
Mme Mao was more dedicated to her personal vendettas than to real
issues, and because she did not know my father and had no personal
grudge against him, she did not pursue him.

We were not to know this, however, and I tried to take comfort in the
thought that her reported comment might only be a rumor.  In theory,
wall posters were unofficial, since they were written by the 'masses'
and not part of the official media.  But, deep down, I knew that what
they said was tale.

With the Tings' venom and Mme Mao's condemnation, the Rebels'
denunciation meetings became more brutal, even though my father was
still allowed to live at home.

One day he came back with one of his eyes badly damaged.

Another day I saw him standing on a slow-moving truck, being paraded
through the streets.  A huge placard hung from a thin wire that was
eating into his neck, and his arms were twisted ferociously behind his
back.  He was struggling to keep his head up under the forceful pushing
of some Rebels.  What made me saddest of all was that he appeared
indifferent to his physical pain.  In his insanity, his mind seemed to
be detached from his body.

He tore to pieces any photographs in the family album which had the
Tings in them.  He burned his quilt covers and sheets, and much of the
family's clothing.  He broke the legs of chairs and tables and burned
them, too.

One afternoon my mother was having a rest on their bed and Father was
reclining on his favorite bamboo armchair in his study, when he
suddenly jumped up and stamped into the bedroom.  We heard the banging
and dashed after him and found him gripping my mother's neck.  We
screamed and tried to pull him away.  It looked as if my mother was
going to be strangled.  But then he let go with a jerk, and strode out
of the room.

My mother sat up slowly, her face ashen.  She cupped her left ear in
her hand.  My father had awakened her by striking her on the side of
the head.  Her voice was weak, but she was calm.

"Don't worry, I'm all right," she said to my sobbing grandmother.  Then
she turned to us and said, "See how your father is.  Then go to your
rooms."  She leaned back against the oval mirror framed in camphor wood
which formed the headboard of the bed.  In the mirror I saw her right
hand clutching the pillow.  My grandmother sat by my parents' door all
night.  I could not sleep either.  What would happen if my father
attacked my mother with their door locked?

My mother's left ear was permanently damaged, and became almost totally
deaf.  She decided it was too dangerous for her to stay at home, and
the next day she went to her department to find a place to move to. The
Rebels there were very sympathetic.  They gave her a room in the
gardener's lodge in the corner of the garden.  It was terribly small,
about eight feet by ten.  Only a bed and a desk could be squeezed in,
with no space even to walk between them.

That night, I slept there with my mother, my grandmother, and
Xiao-fang, all crammed together on the bed.

We could not stretch our legs or turn.  The bleeding from my mother's
womb worsened.  We were very frightened because, having just moved to
this new place, we had no stove and could not sterilize the syringe and
needle, and therefore could not give her an injection.  In the end, I
was so exhausted I dropped into a fitful sleep.  But I knew that
neither my grandmother nor my mother closed their eyes.

Over the next few days, while Jin-ming went on living with Father, I
stayed at my mother's new place helping to look after her.  Living in
the next room was a young Rebel leader from my mother's district.  I
had not said hello to him because I was not sure whether he would want
to be spoken to by someone from the family of a capitalistroader, but
to my surprise he greeted us normally when we ran into each other.  He
treated my mother with courtesy, although he was a bit stiff.  This was
a great relief after the ostentatious frostiness of the Rebels in my
father's department.

One morning a couple of days after we moved in, my mother was washing
her face under the eaves because there was no space inside when this
man called out to her and asked if she would like to swap rooms.  His
was twice as big as ours.  We moved that afternoon.  He also helped us
to get another bed so we could sleep in relative comfort.

We were very touched.

This young man had a severe squint and a very pretty girlfriend who
stayed overnight with him, which was almost unheard of in those days.
They did not seem to mind us knowing.  Of course, capitalist-roaders
were in no position to tell tales.  When I bumped into them in the
mornings, they always gave me a very kind smile which told me they were
happy.  I realized then that when people are happy they become kind.

When my mother's health improved, I went back to Father.  The apartment
was in a dreadful state: the windows were broken, and there were bits
of burned furniture and clothing all over the floor.  My father seemed
indifferent to whether I was there or not; he just paced incessantly
around and around.  At night I locked my bedroom door, because he could
not sleep and would insist on talking to me, endlessly, without making
sense.  But there was a small window over the door which could not be
locked.  One night I woke up to see him slithering through the tiny
aperture and jumping nimbly to the floor.

But he paid no attention to me.  He aimlessly picked up various pieces
of heavy mahogany furniture and let them drop with seemingly little
effort.  In his insanity he had become super humanly agile and
powerful. Staying with him was a nightmare.  Many times, I wanted to
run away to my mother, but I could not bring myself to leave him.

A couple of times he slapped me, which he had never done before, and I
would go and hide in the back garden under the balcony of the
apartment.  In the chill of the spring nights I listened desperately
for the silence upstairs which meant he had gone to sleep.

One day, I missed his presence.  I was seized by a presentiment and
rushed out of the door.  A neighbor who

?

lived on the top floor was walking down the stairs.  We had stopped
greeting each other some time before in order to avoid trouble, but
this time he said: "I saw your father going out onto the roof."

Our apattsnent block had five stories.  I raced to the top floor.  On
the landing to the left a small window gave onto the flat, shingled
roof of the four-story block next door.

The roof had low iron rails around the edge.  As I was trying to climb
through the window, I saw my father at the edge of the roof.  I thought
I saw him lifting his left leg over the railing.

"Father," I called, in a voice which was trembling, although I was
trying to force it to sound normal.  My instinct told me I must not
alarm him.

He paused, and turned toward me: "What are you doing here?"

"Please come and help me get through the window."

Somehow, I coaxed him away from the edge of the roof.

I grabbed his hand and led him onto the landing.  I was shaking.
Something seemed to have touched him, and an almost normal expression
replaced his usual blank indifference or the intense introspective
rolling of his eyes.  He carried me downstairs to a sofa and even
fetched a towel to wipe away my tears.  But the signs of normality were
short-lived.  Before I had recovered from the shock, I had to scramble
up and run because he raised his hand and was about to hit me.

Instead of allowing my father medical treatment, the Rebels found his
insanity a source of entertainment.  A poster serial appeared every
other day entitled "The Inside Story of Madman Chang."  Its authors,
from my father's department, ridiculed and lavished sarcasm on my
father.

The posters were pasted up in a prime site just outside the department,
and drew large, appreciative crowds.  I forced myself to read them,
although I was aware of the stares from other readers, many of whom
knew who I was.  I heard them whispering to those who did not know my
identity.  My heart would tremble with rage and unbearable pain for my
father, but I knew that reports of my reactions would reach my father's
persecutors.  I wanted to look calm, and to let them know that they
could not demoralize us.  I had no fear or sense of humiliation, only
contempt for them.

What had turned people into monsters?  What was the reason for all this
pointless brutality?  It was in this period that my devotion to Mao
began to wane.  Before when people had been persecuted I could not be
absolutely sure of their innocence; but I knew my parents.  Doubts
about Mao's infallibility crept into my mind, but at that stage, like
many people, I mainly blamed his wife and the Cultural Revolution
Authority.  Mao himself, the godlike Emperor, was still beyond
questioning.

We watched my father deteriorate mentally and physically with each
passing day.  My mother went to ask Chen Mo for help again.  He
promised to see what he could do.

We waited, but nothing happened: his silence meant he must have failed
to get the Tings to allow my father to have treatment.  In desperation,
my mother went to the Red Chengdu headquarters to see Yan and Yong.

The dominant group at Sichuan Medical College was part of Red Chengdu.
The college had a psychiatric hospital attached to it, and a word from
Red Chengdu headquarters could get my father in.  Yan and Yong were
very sympathetic, but they would have to convince their comrades.

Humanitarian considerations had been condemned by Mao as 'bourgeois
hypocrisy," and it went without saying that there should be no mercy
for 'class enemies."  Yan and Yong had to give a political reason for
treating my father.

They had a good one: he was being persecuted by the Tings.  He could
supply ammunition against them, perhaps even help to bring them down.
This, in turn, could bring about the collapse of z6 August.

There was another reason.  Mao had said the new Revolutionary
Committees must contain 'revolutionary officials'

as well as Rebels and members of the armed forces.  Both Red Chengdu
and 26 August were trying to find officials to represent them on the
Sichuan Revolutiona~ Commiuee.

Besides, the Rebels were beginning to find out how complex politics
was, and how daunting a task it was actually to run an administration.
They needed competent politicians as advisers.  Red Chengdu thought my
father was an ideal candidate, and sanctioned medical treatment.

Red Chengdu knew that my father had been denounced for saying
blasphemous things against Mao and the Cultural Revolution, and that
Mme.  Mao had condemned him.

But these claims had only been made by their enemies in wall posters,
where truth and lies were often mixed up.

They could, therefore, dismiss them.

My father was admitted to the mental hospital of Sichuan Medical
College.  It was in the suburbs of Chengdu, surrounded by rice fields.
Bamboo leaves swayed over the brick walls and the iron main gate.  A
second gate shut off a walled courtyard green with moss the residential
area for the doctors and nurses.  At the end of the courtyard, a flight
of red sandstone stairs led into the windowless side of a two-story
building flanked by solid, high walls.  The stairs were the only access
to the inside the psychiatric wards.

The two male nurses who came for my father were dressed in ordinary
clothes, and told him they were taking him to another denunciation
meeting.  When they reached the hospital my father straggled to get
away.  They dragged him upstairs into a small empty room, shutting the
door behind them so my mother and I would not have to see them putting
him into a straitjacket.  I was heartbroken to see him being so roughly
handled, but I knew it was for his own good.

The psychiatrist, Dr.  Su, was in his thirties, with a gentle face and
professional manner.  He told my mother he would spend a week observing
my father before he gave a diagnosis.  At the end of the week, he
reached his conclusion:

schizophrenia.  My father was given electric shocks and insulin
injections, for which he had to be tied tight onto the bed.  In a few
days, he began to recover his sanity.  With tears in his eyes, he
begged my mother to ask the doctor to change the treatment.

"It is so painful."  His voice broke.

"It feels worse than death."  But Dr.  Su said there was no other
way.

The next time I saw my father, he was sitting on his bed chatting to my
mother and Yan and Yong.  They were all smiling.  My father was even
laughing.  He looked well again.

I had to pretend to go to the toilet to wipe away my tears.

On the orders of Red Chengdu, my father received special food and a
full-time nurse~Yan and Yong visited him often, with members of his
department who were sympathetic to him and who had themselves been
subjected to denunciation meetings by Mrs.  Shau's group.  My father
liked Yan and Yong very much, and although he could be unobservant, he
realized they were in love, and teased them charmingly.  I could see
they enjoyed this greatly.  At last, I felt, the nightmare was over;
now that my father was well, we could face any disasters together.

The treatment lasted about forty days.  By mid-July he was back to
normal.  He was discharged, and he and my mother were taken to Chengdu
University, where they were given a suite in a small self contained
courtyard.

Student guards were placed on the gate.  My father was provided with a
pseudonym and told that he should not go out of the courtyard during
the day, for his safety.  My mother fetched their meals from a special
kitchen.  Yan and Yong came to see him every day, as did the Red
Chengdu leaders, who were all very courteous to him.

I visited my parents there often, riding a borrowed bicycle for an hour
on potholed country roads.  My father seemed peaceful.  He would say
over and over again how grateful he felt to these students for enabling
him to get treatment.

When it was dark, he was allowed out, and we went for
long, quiet strolls on the campus, followed at
a distance by a couple of guards.  We wandered along the lanes lined
with hedges of Cape jasmine.  The fist-sized white flowers gave off a
strong fragrance in the summer breeze.  It seemed like a dream of
serenity, so far away from the terror and violence.  I knew this was my
father's prison, but I wished he would never have to come out.

In the summer of 1967, factional fighting among the Rebels was
escalating into mini civil war all over China.

The antagonism between the Rebel factions was far greater than their
supposed anger toward the capitalist-roaders, because they were
fighting tooth and nail for power.  Kang Sheng, Mao's intelligence
chief, and Mme Mao led the Cultural Revolution Authority in stirring up
more animosity by calling the factional fighting 'an extension of the
struggle between the Communists and the Kuomintang' without specifying
which group was which.  The Cultural Revolution Authority ordered the
army to 'arm the Rebels for self-defense," without telling them which
factions to support.  Inevitably, different army units armed different
factions on the basis of their own preferences.

The armed forces were in great upheaval already, because Lin Biao was
busy trying to purge his opponents and replace them with his own men.
Eventually Mao realized that he could not afford instability in the
army, and reined in Lin Biao.  However, he appeared to be in two minds
about the factional fighting among the Rebels.  On the one hand, he
wanted the factions to unite so that his personal power structure could
be established.  On the other hand, he seemed incapable of repressing
his love of fighting: as bloody wars spread across China he said, "It
is not a bad thing to let the young have some practice in using arms we
haven't had a war for so long."

In Sichuan, the battles were especially fierce, partly because the
province was the center of China's arms industry.  Tanks, armored cars,
and artillery were taken from the production lines and warehouses by
both sides.  Another cause was the Tings, who set out to eliminate
their opponents.  In Yibin there was brutal fighting with guns, hand
grenades, mortars, and machine guns.  Over a hundred people died in the
city of Yibin alone.  In the end Red Chengdu was forced to abandon the
city.

Many went to the nearby city of Luzhou, which was held by Red Chengdu.
The Tings dispatched over 5,000 members of 26 August to attack the
city, and eventually seized it, killing nearly 300 and wounding many
more.

In Chengdu, the fighting was sporadic, and only the most fanatical
joined in.  Even so, I saw parades of tens of thousands of Rebels
carrying the blood-soaked corpses of people killed in bat ties and
people shooting rifles in the streets.

It was under these circumstances that Red Chengdu made three requests
of my father: to announce his support for them; to tell them about the
Tings; and to become an adviser and eventually represent them on the
Sichuan Revolution Committee.

He refused.  He said he could not back one group against another, nor
could he provide information against the Tings, as that might aggravate
the situation and create more animosity.  He also said he would not
represent a faction on the Sichuan Revolutionary Committee indeed, he
had no desire to be on it at all.

Eventually, the friendly atmosphere turned ugly.  The chiefs of Red
Chengdu were split.  One group said they had never encountered anyone
so incredibly obstinate and perverse.  My father had been persecuted to
the brink of death, yet he refused to let other people avenge him.  He
dared to oppose the powerful Rebels who had saved his life.  He turned
down an offer to be rehabilitated and return to power.  In anger and
exasperation, some shouted: "Let's give him a good beating.  We should
at least break a couple of his bones to teach him a lesson!"

But an and Yong spoke up for him, as did a few others.

?

"It is rare to see a character like him," said Yong.

"It is not right to punish him.  He would not bend even if he were
beaten to death.  And to torture him is to bring shame on us all.  Here
is a man of principle!"

Despite the threat of beating, and his gratitude to these Rebels, my
father would not go against his principles.  One night at the end of
September 1967 a car brought him and my mother home.  Yan and Yong
could no longer protect him.  They accompanied my parents home, and
said goodbye.

My parents immediately fell into the hands of the Tings and Mrs. Shau's
group.  The Tings made it clear that the attitude staff members took
toward my father would determine their future.  Mrs.  Shau was promised
the equivalent of my father's job in the forthcoming Sichuan
Revolutionary Committee, provided my father was 'thoroughly smashed."
Those who showed sympathy to my father were themselves condemned.

One day two men from Mrs.  Shau's group came to our apatunent to take
my father away to a 'meeting."  Later they returned and told me and my
brothers to go to his depa~i,nent to bring him back.

My father was leaning against a wall in the courtyard of the
department, in a position which showed that he had been trying to stand
up.  His face was black and blue, and unbelievably swollen.  His head
had been half shaved, clearly in a very rough manner.

There had been no denunciation meeting.  When he arrived at the office,
he was immediately yanked into a small room, where half a dozen large
strangers set upon him.  They punched and kicked the lower part of his
body, especially his genitals.  They forced water down his mouth and
nose and then stamped on his stomach.  Water, blood, and excreta were
pressed out.  My father fainted.

When he came to, the thugs had disappeared.  My father felt terribly
thirsty.  He dragged himself out of the room, and scooped some water
from a puddle in the courtyard.

He tried to stand up, but was unable to stay on his feet.

Members of Mrs.  Shau's group were in the courtyard, but no one lifted
a finger to help him.

The thugs came from the 26 August faction in Chongqing, about x5o miles
from Chengdu.  There had been large-scale battles there, with heavy
artillery lobbing shells across the Yangtze.  26 August was driven out
of the city, and many members fled to Chengdu, where some were
accommodated in our compound.  They were restless and frustrated, and
told Mrs.  Shau's group that their fists 'itched to put an end to their
vegetarian life and to taste some blood and meat."  My father was
offered up to them.

That night, my father, who had never once moaned after his previous
beatings, cried out in agony.  The next morning, my fourteen-year-old
brother Jin-ming raced to the compound kitchen as soon as it was open
to borrow a cart to take him to the hospital.  Xiao-her, then thirteen,
went out and bought a hair clipper, and cut the remaining hair from my
father's half-shaved head.  When he saw his bald head in the mirror, my
father gave a wry smile.

"This is good.  I won't have to worry about my hair being pulled next
time I'm at a denunciation meeting."

We put my father on the cart and pulled him to a nearby orthopedic
hospital.  This time we did not need authorization to get him looked
at, as his ailment had nothing to do with the mind.  Mental illness was
a very sensitive area.

Bones had no ideological color.  The doctor was very warm.

When I saw how carefully he touched my father, a lump rose in my
throat.  I had seen so much shoving, slapping, and hitting, and so
little gentleness.

The doctor said two of my father's ribs were broken.  But he could not
be hospitalized.  That needed authorization.

Besides, there were far too many severe injuries for the hospital to
accommodate.  It was crams ed with people who had been wounded in the
denunciation meetings and the factional fightng.  I saw a young man on
a stretcher with a jl third of his head gone.  His companion told us he
had been hit by a hand grenade.

My mother went to see Chen Mo again, and asked him to put in a word
with the Tings to stop my father's beatings.

A few days later Chen told my mother the Tings were prepared to
'forgive' my father if he would write a wall poster singing the praises
of 'good officials' Liu Jie-ting and Zhang Xi-ting.  He emphasized that
they had just been given renewed full, explicit backing by the Cultural
Revolution Authority, and Zhou Enlai had specifically stated that he
regarded the Tings as 'good officials."  To continue to oppose them,
Chen told my mother, was tantamount to 'throwing an egg against a
rock."  when my mother told my father, he said, "There's nothing good
to say about them."

"But," she implored him tearfully, 'this is not to get your job back,
or even for rehabilitation, it's for your life!  What is a poster
compared to a life?"

"I will not sell my soul," answered my father.

For over a year, until the end of 1968, my father was in and out of
detention, along with most of the former leading officials in the
provincial government.  Our apa~uHent was constantly raided and turned
upside down.  Detention was now called "Mao Zedong Thought Study
Courses."  The pressure in these 'courses' was such that many groveled
to the Tings; some committed suicide.  But my father never gave in to
the Tings' demands to work with them.  He would say later how much
having a loving family had helped him.  Most of those who committed
suicide did so after their families had disowned them.  We visited my
father in detention whenever we were allowed, which was seldom, and
surrounded him with affection whenever he was home for a fleeting
stay.

The Tings knew that my father loved my mother very much, and tried to
break him through her.  Intense pressure was put on her to denounce
him.  She had many reasons to resent my father.  He had not invited her
mother to their wedding.  He had let her walk hundreds of agonizing
miles,

and had not given her much sympathy in her crises.  In Yibin he had
refused to let her go to a better hospital for a dangerous birth.  He
had always given the Party and the revolution priority over her.  But
my mother had understood and respected my father and had above all
never ceased to love him.  She would particularly stand by him now that
he was in trouble.  No amount of suffering could bring her to denounce
him.

My mother's own department turned a deaf ear to the Tings' orders to
torment her, but Mrs.  Shau's group was happy to oblige, and so were
some other organizations which had nothing to do with her.  Altogether,
she had to go through about a hundred denunciation meetings.  Once she
was taken to a rally of tens of thousands of people in the People's
Park in the center of Chengdu to be denounced.  Most of the
participants had no idea who she was.  She was not nearly important
enough to merit such a mass event.

My mother was condemned for all sorts of things, not least for having a
warlord general as a father.  The fact that General Xue had died when
she was barely two made no difference.

In those days, every capitalist-roader had one or more teams
investigating his or her past in minute detail, because Mao wanted the
history of everyone working for him thoroughly checked.  At different
times my mother had four different teams investigating her, the last of
which contained about fifteen people.  They were sent to various parts
of China.  It was through these investigations that my mother came to
know the whereabouts of her old friends and relatives with whom she had
lost contact for years.

Most of the investigators just went sight-seeing and returned with
nothing incriminating, but one group came back with a 'scoop."

Back in Jinzhou in the late 194os, Dr.  Xia had let a room to the
Communist agent Yu-wn, who had been my mother's boss, in charge of
collecting military information and smuggling it out of the city.
Yu-wu's own controller, who was unknown to my mother then, had been
pretending to work for the Kuomintang.  During the Cultural Revolution,
he was put under intense pressure to confess to being a Kuomintang spy,
and was tortured atrociously.  In the end, he 'confessed," inventing a
spy ring which included Yu-wu.

Yu-wu was tortured ferociously as well.  In order to avoid
incriminating other people, he killed himself by slashing his wrists.
He did not mention my mother.  But the investigation team found out
about their connection and claimed that she was a member of the 'spy
ring."

Her teenage contact with the Kuomintang was dragged up.  All the
questions that had come up in 1955 were gone over again.  This time
they were not asked in order to get an answer.  My mother was simply
ordered to admit that she was a Kuomintang spy.  She argued that the
investigation in 1955 had cleared her, but she was told that the chief
investigator then, Mr.  Kuang, was a 'traitor and Kuomintang spy'
himself.

Mr.  Kuang had been imprisoned by the Kuomintang in his youth.  The
Kuomintang had promised to release underground Communists if they
signed a recantation for publication in the local newspaper.  At first
he and his comrades had refused, but the Party instructed them to
accept.  They were told the Party needed them, and did not mind
'anti-Communist statements' which were not sincere.  Mr.  Kuang
followed orders and was duly released.

Many others had done the same thing.  In one famous case in 1936,
sixty-one imprisoned Communists were released this way.  The order to
'recant' was given by the Party Central Committee and delivered by Liu
Shaoqi.

Some of these sixty-one subsequently became top officials in the
Communist government, including vice-premiers, ministers, and first
secretaries of provinces.  During the Cultural Revolution, Mme Mao and
Kang Sheng announced that they were 'sixty-one big traitors and
spies."

The verdict was endorsed by Mao personally, and these people were
subjected to the cruelest tortures.  Even people remotely connected
with them got into deadly trouble.

Following this precedent, hundreds of thousands of former underground
workers and their contacts, some of the bravest men and women who had
fought for a Communist China, were charged with being 'traitors and
spies' and suffered detention, brutal denunciation meetings, and
torture.  According to a later official account, in the province next
to Sichuan, Yunnan, over 14,000 people died.

In Hebei province, which surrounds Peking, 84,000 were detained and
tortured; thousands died.  My mother learned years later that her first
boyfriend, Cousin Hu, was among them.  She had thought he had been
executed by the Kuomintang, but his father had in fact bought him out
of prison with gold bars.  No one would ever tell my mother how he
died.

Mr.  Kuang fell under the same accusation.  Under torture, he attempted
suicide, unsuccessfully.  The fact that he had cleared my mother in
1956 was alleged to prove her 'guilt."  She was kept in various forms
of detention on and off for nearly two years from late 1967 to October
1969.  Her conditions depended largely on her guards.

Some were kind to her when they were alone.  One of them, the wife of
an army officer, got medicine for her hemorrhage.  She also asked her
husband, who had access to privileged food supplies, to bring my mother
milk, eggs, and chicken every week.

Thanks to kindhearted guards like her, my mother was allowed home
several times for a few days.  The Tings learned of this, and the kind
guards were replaced by a sour4 aced woman whom my mother did not know,
who tormented and tortured her for pleasure.  When the fancy took her,
she would make my mother stand bent over in the courtyard for hours. In
the winter, she would make her kneel in cold water until she passed
out.  Twice she put my mother on what was called a 'tiger bench."  My
mother had

?

343' Father.4rrested 479 to sit on a narrow bench with her legs
stretched out in front of her.  Her torso was tied to a pillar and her
thighs to the bench so she could not move or bend her legs.  Then
bricks were forced under her heels.  The intention was to break the
knees or the hipbones.  Twenty years before, in Jinzhou, she had been
threatened with this in the Kuomintang torture chamber.  The 'tiger
bench' had to stop because the guard needed men to help her push in the
bricks; they helped reluctantly a couple of times, but then refused to
have any more to do with it.  Years later the woman was diagnosed as a
psychopath, and today is in a psychiatric hospital.

My mother signed many 'confessions," admitting that she had sympathized
with a 'capitalist road."  But she refused to denounce my father, and
she denied all 'spy' charges, which she knew would inevitably lead to
the incrimination of others.

During her detention we were often not allowed to see her, and even had
no idea where she was.  I would wander the streets outside the possible
place in the hope of catching sight of her.

There was a period when she was detained in a deserted cinema on the
main shopping street.  There we were occasionally permitted to deliver
a parcel for her to a warden, or to see her for a few minutes, although
never on her own.  When a fierce guard was on duty, we had to sit under
freezing eyes.  One day in autumn 1968 I went there to deliver a food
parcel and was told it could not be accepted.  No reason was given, and
I was told not to send things anymore.  When my grandmother heard the
news she passed out.  She thought my mother must be dead.

It was unbearable not knowing what had happened to my mother.  I took
my six-year-old brother Xiao-fang by the hand and went to the cinema.
We walked up and down the street in front of the gate.  We searched the
rows of windows on the second floor.  In desperation we screamed
"Mother!  Mother!"  at the top of our voices again and again.

Passersby stared at us, but I took no notice.  I just wanted to see
her.  My brother cried.  But my mother did not appear.

Years later, she told me that she had heard us.  In fact, her
psychopath guard had opened the window slightly so our voices would be
louder.  My mother was told that if she agreed to denounce my father,
and to confess to being a Kuomintang spy, she could see us
immediately.

"Otherwise," said the guard, 'you may never get out of this building
alive."  My mother said no.  All the time, she dug her nails into her
palms to stop her tears from falling.

21.  "Giving Charcoal in Snow'~ My Siblings and My Friends
(1967-1968)

Throughout 1967 and 1968, while Mao struggled to set up his personal
power system, he kept his victims, like my parents, in a state of
uncertainty and suffering.

Human anguish did not concern Mao.  People existed only to help him
realize his strategic plans.  But his purpose was not genocide, and my
family, like many other victims, were not deliberately starved.  My
parents still received their salaries every month in spite of the fact
that not only were they doing no work, they were also being denounced
and tormented.  The main compound canteen was working normally to
enable the Rebels to carry on with their 'revolution," and we, like the
families of other capitalist-roaders, were fed.  We also got the same
rations from the state as everyone else in the cities.

Much of the urban population was kept 'on hold' for the revolution. Mao
wanted the population to fight, but to live.

He protected the extremely capable premier, Zhou Enlai, so that he
could keep the economy going.  He knew he needed another first-class
administrator in reserve in case anything happened to Zhou, so he kept
Deng Xiaoping in relative security.  The country was not allowed to
collapse totally.

But, as the revolution dragged on, large parts of the economy slipped
into paralysis.  The urban population increased by several tens of
millions, but virtually no new housing or other service facilities were
built in the towns.

Nearly everything, from salt, toothpaste, and toilet paper to every
kind of food and clothing, either was rationed or disappeared
completely.  In Chengdu there was no sugar for a year, and six months
passed without a single bar of soap.

Starting from June 1966, there was no schooling.  The teachers either
had been denounced or were organizing their own Rebel groups.  No
school meant no control.  But what could we do with our freedom?  There
were virtually no books, no music, no films, no theater, no museums, no
teahouses, almost no way of keeping oneself occupied except cards,
which, though not officially sanctioned, made a stealthy comeback.
Unlike most revolutions, in Mao's there was nothing to do.  Naturally,
"Red Guardship' became many youngsters' full-time occupation.  The only
ways they could release their energy and frustration were in violent
denunciations and in physical and verbal bat ties with each other.

Joining the Red Guards was not compulsory.  With the disintegration of
the Party system, control over individuals loosened, and most of the
population was left alone.  Many people just stayed idle at home, and
one result was an explosion of petty fights.  Surliness replaced the
good service and polite behavior of the pre-Cultural Revolution days.
It became extremely common to see people quarreling on the streets with
shop assistants, with bus conductors, with passersby.  Another result
was that, since no one was looking after birth control, there was a
baby boom.

The population increased during the Cultural Revolution by two hundred
million.

By the end of 1966 my teenage siblings and I had decided that we had
had enough of being Red Guards.

Children in condemned families were supposed to 'draw a line' between
themselves and their parents, and many did so.  One of President Liu
Shaoqi's daughters wrote wall posters 'exposing' her father.  I knew
children who changed their surnames to demonstrate that they were
disowning their fathers, others who never visited their parents in
detention, and some who even took part in denunciation meetings against
their parents.

Once, when my mother was under tremendous pressure to divorce my
father, she asked us what we thought.  Standing by him meant we could
become 'blacks'; we had all seen the discrimination and torment such
people suffered.

But we said we would stick by him, come what may.  My mother said she
was pleased and proud of us.  Our devotion to our parents was increased
by our empathy for their suffering, our admiration for their integrity
and courage, and our loathing for their tormentors.  We came to feel a
new degree of respect, and love, for our parents.

We grew up fast.  We had no rival ties no squabbles, and no resentment
of each other, none of the usual problems or pleasures of teenagers.
The Cultural Revolution destroyed normal adolescence, with all its
pitfalls, and threw us straight into sensible adulthood in our early
teens.

At the age of fourteen, my love for my parents had an intensity that
could not have existed under normal circumstances.  My life revolved
entirely around them.  Whenever they were briefly at home, I would
watch their moods, trying to provide amusing company.  When they were
in detention, I would repeatedly go to the disdainful-looking Rebels
and demand a visit.  Sometimes I would be allowed a few minutes to sit
and talk with one of my parents, in the company of a guard.  I would
tell them how much I loved them.  I became well known among the former
staff of the Sichuan government and the Eastern District of Chengdu,
and an irritation to my parents' tormentors, who also hated me for
refusing to show fear of them.  Once Mrs.  Shau screamed that I 'looked
straight through' her.  Their fury led them to invent the accusation,
printed on one of their wall posters, that Red Chengdu had given my
father treatment because I had used my body to seduce Yong.

Apart from being with my parents, I spent most of my abundant free time
with friends.  After I came back from Peking in December 1966, I went
for a month to an airplane maintenance factory on the outskirts of
Chengdu with Plumpie and Ching-ching, a friend of hers.  We needed
something to occupy ourselves, and the most important thing we could
do, according to Mao, was to go to factories to stir up rebellious
actions against capitalistroaders.  Upheaval was invading industry too
slowly for Mao's liking.

The only action the three of us stirred up was the attention of some
young men from the now defunct factory basketball team.  We spent a lot
of time strolling on the country roads together, enjoying the rich
evening scent of the early bean blossoms.  But soon, as my parents'
suffering worsened, I went home, leaving Mao's orders and my
participation in the Cultural Revolution behind once and for all.

My friendship with Plumpie, Ching-ching, and the basketball players
lasted.  Also in our circle were my sister Xiao-hong and several other
girls from my school.  They were all older than I. We would meet
frequently in the home of one or another of us, and linger there for
the whole day, and often the night as well, having nothing else to
do.

We had endless discussions about which of the basketball players
fancied whom.  The captain of the team, a handsome nineteen-year-old
called Sai, was the center of speculation.  The girls wondered whether
he liked me or Ching-ching more.  He was reticent and reserved, and
Ching-ching was very keen on him.  Every time we were going to see him,
she would meticulously wash and comb her shoulder-length hair,
carefully iron and adjust her clothes to look stylish, and even put on
a lit He powder and rouge and pencil her eyebrows.  We all teased her
gently

I was also drawn to Sai.  I could feel my heart pound whenever I
thought of him, and would wake up at night seeing his face and feeling
feverishly hot.  I often murmured his name and talked to him in my mind
whenever I felt fear or worry.  But I never revealed anything to him,
or to my friends, or even to myself explicitly.  I only timidly
fantasized about him.  My parents dominated my life and my conscious
thoughts.  Any indulgence in my own affairs was immediately suppressed
as being disloyal.  The Cultural Revolution had deprived me of, or
spared me, a normal girlhood with tantrums, bickerings, and
boyfriends.

But I was not without vanity.  I sewed big blue wax-dyed,
abstract-patterned patches on the knees and seat of my trousers, which
had faded to pale gray.  My friends would laugh at the sight of them.
My grandmother was scandalized, and complained, "No other girls dress
like you."

But I insisted.  I was not trying to make myself look beautiful, just
different.

One day one of my friends told us that her parents, both distinguished
actors, had just committed suicide, unable to stand the denunciations.
Not long after, news came that the brother of another gift had killed
himself.  He had been a student at the Peking Aeronautical College, and
he and some fellow students had been denounced for trying to organize
an anti-Mao party.  He threw himself out of a third-floor window when
the police came to arrest him.

Some of his fellow 'conspirators' were executed; others were given life
sentences, the normal punishment for anyone attempting to organize an
opposition, which was rare.

Tragedies like this were part of our everyday life.

The families of Plumpie, Ching-ching, and some others were nor hit. And
they remained my friends.  They were not harassed by my parents'
persecutors, who could not extend their power to that degree.  But they
still ran risks by not swimming with the tide.  My friends were among
the millions who held sacred the traditional Chinese code of loyalty
'giving charcoal in snow."  The fact that they were there helped me
through the worst years of the Cultural Revolution.

They gave me a lot of practical help, too.  Toward the end of 1967 Red
Chengdu began to attack our compound, which was controlled by 26
August, and our block was turned into a fortress.  We were ordered to
move from our third-floor aparisuent into some ground-floor rooms in
the next block.

My parents were in detention at the time.  My father's department,
which would normally have looked after the move, now only gave us our
marching orders.  As there were no furniture-removal companies, without
the help of our friends my family would have ended up without a bed.

Still, we moved only the most essential furniture, leaving things like
my father's heavy bookcases behind; we could not lift them, let alone
can them down several flights of stairs.

Our new quarters were in an apasis~lent already occupied by the family
of another capitalist-roader, who were now ordered to vacate half of
it.  Apaximents were being reorganized like this all over the compound
so the top floors could be used as command posts.  My sister and I
shared a room.  We kept the window facing the now deserted back garden
permanently shut, because the moment it was opened, a strong stench
would flood in from the blocked drains outside.  At night, we heard
cries for surrender from outside the compound wall, and sporadic
shooting.  One night I was awakened by the sound of shattering glass: a
bullet had come through the window and embedded itself in the wall
opposite.  Strangely, I was not frightened.  After the horrors I had
been through, bullets had lost their effect.

To occupy myself, I began writing poetry in classical styles.  The
first poem with which I felt satisfied was written on my sixteenth
birthday, z5 March 1968.  There was no birthday celebration.  Both my
parents were in detention That night, as I lay in bed listening to the
gunshots and the Rebels' loudspeakers blaring out bloodcurdling
diatribes, I reached a turning point.  I had always been told, and had
believed, that I was living in a paradise on earth, socialist China,
whereas the capitalist world was hell.  Now I asked myself."  If this
is paradise, what then is hell?  I decided that I would like to see for
myself whether there was indeed a place more full of pain.  For the
first time, I consciously hated the regime I lived under, and craved an
alternative.

Still, I subconsciously avoided Mao.  He had been part of my life ever
since I was a child.  He was the idol, the god, the inspiration.  The
purpose of my life had been formulated in his name.  A couple of years
before, I would happily have died for him.  Although his magic power
had vanished from inside me, he was still sacred and un doubtable  Even
now, I did not challenge him.

It was in this mood that I composed my poem.  I wrote about the death
of my indoctrinated and innocent past as dead leaves being swept from a
tree by the whirlwind and carried to a world of no return.  I described
my bewilderment at the new world, at not knowing what and how to think.
It was a poem of groping in the dark, searching.

I wrote the poem down, and was lying in bed going over it in my head
when I heard banging on the door.  From the sound, I knew it was a
house raid.  Mrs.  Shau's Rebels had raided our apa,iment several
times.  They had taken away 'bourgeois luxury items' like my
grandmother's elegant clothes from the pre-Communist days, my mother's
fur lined Manchurian coat, and my father's suits- even though they were
Mao-style.  They even confiscated my woolen trousers.  They kept coming
back to try to find 'evidence' against my father.  I had grown used to
our quarters being turned upside down.

I was seized with anxiety about what would happen if they saw my poem.
When my father first came under attack he asked my mother to burn his
poems; he knew how writing, any writing, could be twisted against its
author.

But my mother could not bring herself to destroy them all.

She kept a few which he had written for her.  These cost him several
brutal denunciation meetings.

In one poem my father poked fun at himself for failing to climb to the
top of a scenic mountain.  Mrs.  Shau and her comrades accused him of
'lamenting his frustrated ambition to usurp China's supreme
leadership."

In another, he described working at night:

The light shines whiter when the night grows darker,

My pen races to meet the dawn... The Rebels claimed he was referring to
socialist China as 'dark night," and that he was working with his pen
to welcome a 'white dawn' - a Kuomintang comeback (white was the color
of counterrevolution).  In those days it was commonplace for such
ridiculous interpretations to be forced upon someone's writings.  Mao,
who was a lover of classical poetry, did not think of making it an
exception to this ghastly rule.  Writing poetry became a highly
dangerous occupation.

When the pounding on the door began, I quickly ran to the toilet, and
locked the door while my grandmother answered Mrs.  Shau and her posse.
My hands trembling, I managed to tear the poem into tiny pieces, throw
them into the bowl, and flush the toilet.  I searched the floor
carefully to make sure no pieces had fallen out.  But the paper did not
all disappear the first time.  I had to wait and flush again.  By now
the Rebels were banging on the door of the toilet, curtly ordering me
to come out immediately.

I did not answer.

My brother Jin-ming also got a fright that night.  Ever since the
Cultural Revolution had started, he had been frequenting a black market
specializing in books.  The commercial instinct of the Chinese is so
strong that black markets, Mao's greatest capitalist Mte noire, existed
right through the crushing pressure of the Cultural Revolution.

In the center of Chengdu, in the middle of the main shopping street,
was a bronze statue of Sun Yat-sen, who had led the 19x i republican
revolution which had overthrown 2,000 years of imperial rule.  The
statue had been erected before the Communists came to power.  Mao was
not particularly keen on any revolutionary leaders before himself,
including Sun.  But it was politic to lay claim to his tradition, so
the statue was allowed to stay, and the patch of ground around it
became a plant nursery.  When the Cultural Revolution broke out, Red
Guards attacked emblems of Sun Yat-sen until Zhou Enlai slapped a
protection order on them.  The statue survived, but the plant nursery
was abandoned as 'bourgeois decadence."  When Red Guards began raiding
people's houses and burning their books, a small crowd started to
gather on this deserted ground to deal in the volumes which had escaped
the bonfires.  All manner of people were to be found there: Red Guards
who wanted to make some cash from the books they had confiscated;
frustrated entrepreneurs who smelled money; scholars who did not want
their books to be burned but were afraid of keeping them; and book
lovers.  The books being traded had all been published or sanctioned
under the Communist regime before the Cultural Revolution.  Apart from
Chinese classics, they included Shakespeare, Dickens, Byron, Shelley,
Shaw, Thackeray, Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Turgenev, Chekhov, Ibsen,
Balzac, Maupassant, Flaubert, Dumas, Zola, and many other world
classics.  Even Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, who had been a great
favorite in China.

The price of the books depended on a variety of factors.

If they had a library stamp in them, most people shunned them.  The
Communist government had such a reputation for control and order that
people did not want to risk being caught with illegally gotten state
property, for which they would be severely punished.  They were much
happier buy 49o "Giving Charcoal in Snowing privately owned books with
no identification marks.

Novels with erotic passages commanded the highest prices, and also
carried the greatest danger.  Stendhars Le Rouge et le Noir, considered
erotic, cost the equivalent of two weeks' wages for an average
person.

Jin-ming went to this black market every day.  His initial capital came
from books which he had obtained from a paper recycling shop, to which
frightened citizens were selling their collections as scrap paper.
Jin-ming had chatted up a shop assistant and bought a lot of these
books, which he resold at much higher prices.  He then bought more
books at the black market, read them, sold them, and bought more.

Between the start of the Cultural Revolution and the end of 1968, at
least a thousand books passed through his hands.  He read at the rate
of one or two a day.  He only dared to keep a dozen or so at any one
time, and had to hide them carefully.  One of his hiding places was
under an abandoned water tower in the compound, until a downpour
destroyed a stock of his favorites, including Jack London's The Call of
the Wild.  He kept a few at home stashed in the mattresses and the
corners of our storeroom.  On the night of the house raid he had Le
Rouge et le Noir hidden in his bed.  But, as always, he had torn the
cover off and replaced it with that of The Selected Works of Mao
Zedong, and Mrs.  Shau and her comrades did not examine it.

Jin-ming dealt in other black-market goods as well.  His enthusiasm for
science had not waned.  At the time, the only black market dealing in
scientific goods in Chengdu traded in semi-conductor radio parts: this
branch of industry was in favor because it 'spread Chairman Mao's
words."

Jin-ming bought parts and made his own radios, which he sold at good
prices.  He bought more parts for his real purpose: testing various
theories in physics which had been nagging him.

To get money for his experiments, he even dealt in Mao badges.  Many
factories had stopped normal production

to produce aluminum badges with Mao's head on them.

Collecting of any kind, including stamps and paintings, had been banned
as a 'bourgeois habit."  So people's instinct for collecting turned to
this sanctioned object although they could only deal in it
clandestinely.  Jin-ming made a small fortune.  Litfie did the Great
Helmsman know that even the image of his head had become a piece of
property for capitalist speculation, the very activity he had tried so
hard to stamp out.

There were repeated clamp downs  Often truckloads of Rebels would
arrive, seal off the streets, and grab anyone who looked suspicious.
Sometimes they sent spies who pretended to be browsing.  Then a whistle
would blow and they would swoop on the dealers.  Those who were caught
had their belongings confiscated.  They were usually beaten.  One
regular punishment was 'bloodletting' stabbing them in the buttocks.
Some were tortured, and all were threatened with double punishment if
they did not stop.  But most came back, again and again.

My second brother, Xiao-her, was twelve at the beginning of 1967.
Having nothing to do, he soon found himself involved in a street gang.
Virtually nonexistent before the Cultural Revolution, these were now
flourishing.  A gang was called a 'dock," and its leader the
'helmsman."  Everyone else was a 'brother," and had a nickname, usually
with some connection with animals: "Thin Dog' if a boy was thin; "Gray
Wolf' if he had a lock of gray hair.  Xiao-her was called "Black Hoof'
because part of his name, her, means 'black," and also because he was
dark, and was swift at running errands, which was one of his duties, as
he was younger than most of the gang members.

At first the gangsters treated him as a revered guest, because they had
rarely known any high officials' children.

Gang members tended to come from poor families, and had often been
school dropouts before the Cultural Revolution.  Their families were
not targets of the revolution, and they were not interested in it,
either.

Some boys sought to imitate the ways of the high officials' children,
disregarding the fact that the high officials had been toppled.  In
their Red Guard days, the high officials' children favored old
Communist army uniforms, as they were the only people who had access to
these through their parents.  Some street boys got the old gear through
black-market trading, or dyed their clothes green.  But they lacked the
haughty air of the elite, and their green was often not quite the right
shade.  They were sneered at by high officials' children, as well as by
their own friends, as 'pseuds."

Later the high officials' children switched to wearing dark-blue
jackets and trousers.  Although most of the population was wearing blue
at the time, theirs was a particular shade, and it was also unusual to
wear the same color top and bottom.  After they had made this their
distinguishing sign, boys and girls from other backgrounds had to avoid
it, if they did not want to be treated as pseuds.  The same went for a
certain kind of shoes: black cord uppers with white plastic soles and a
white plastic band showing in between.

Some gang members invented their own style.  They wore many layers of
shirts under an outer garment, and turned out all their collars.  The
more collars you named out, the smarter you were considered to be.
Often Xiao-her wore six or seven shirts under his jacket and two even
in the boiling summer heat.  Jogging pants always had to show under
their shortened trousers.  They also wore white sneakers without laces,
and sported army caps, with cardboard strips tucked inside to make the
peaks stick up so they looked imposing.

One of the main ways in which Xiao-her's 'brothers' occupied their
empty days was stealing.  Whatever they got, their haul had to be
handed over to the helmsman to be divided up evenly among them.
Xiao-her was too afraid to steal anything, but his brothers gave him
his share without demur.

Theft was extremely widespread during the Cultural Revolution,
particularly pick pocketing and stealing bicycles.  Most people I knew
had their pockets picked at least once.  For me, shopping trips often
involved either losing my own purse or seeing someone yelling because
their purse had been stolen.  The police, who had split into factions,
exercised only token surveillance.

When foreigners first came to China in large numbers in the 197os, many
were impressed by the 'moral cleanliness' of the society: a discarded
sock would follow its owner a thousand miles from Peking to Guangzhou,
cleaned and folded and placed in his hotel room.  The visitors did not
realize that only foreigners and Chinese under close surveillance
received such attention, or that no one would dare to steal from
foreigners, because taking even a handkerchief was likely to be
punished by death.  The clean folded sock bore no relation to the real
state of society: it was just part of the regime's theater.

Xiao-her's brothers were also obsessed with chasing gifts.  The twelve-
and thirteen-year-olds like Xiao-her were often too shy to go after
gifts themselves, so they became the older boys' messengers, delivering
their error fiddled love letters.  Xiao-her would knock on a door,
praying that it would be opened by the girl herself and not her father
or brother, who was sure to slap him across the head.  Sometimes, when
fear got the upper hand, he would slip the letter under the door.

When a girl rejected a proposal, Xiao-her and other younger boys became
the tool of revenge of the spurned lover, making noises outside her
house and firing catapults at her window.  When the girl came out, they
spat at her, swore at her, shook their middle fingers at her, and
yelled dirty words which they did not fully understand.  Abusive
Chinese terms for women are rather graphic: 'shuffle' (for the shape of
her genitals), 'horse saddle' (for the image of being mounted), over
spilling oil lamp' ('too frequent' discharge), and 'worn-out shoes'
(much 'used').

Some girls tried to find protectors in the gangs, and the more capable
ones became helms women themselves.  The girls who became involved in
this male world sported their own picturesque sobriquets, like "Dewy
Black Peony," "Broken Wine Vessel,"

"Snake Enchantress."

The third major occupation of the gangs was fighting, at the slightest
provocation.  Xiao-her was very excited by the fights, but much to his
regret, he was endowed with what he called 'a cowardly disposition." He
would run away at the first sign that a battle was turning ugly. Thanks
to his lack of bravado, he survived intact while many boys were
injured, even killed, in these pointless exchanges.

One afternoon, he and some of his brothers were loitering about as
usual when a member of the gang rushed over and said the home of a
brother had just been raided by another dock, and this brother had been
subjected to a 'bloodletting."  They went back to their own 'dockyard'
to collect their weapons sticks, bricks, knives, wire whips, and
cudgels.  Xiao-her tucked a three-section cudgel into his leather belt.
They ran to the house where the incident had occurred, but found that
their enemies had gone and their wounded brother had been taken to a
hospital by his family.  Xiao-her's helmsman wrote a letter, peppered
with errors, throwing down the gauntlet to the other gang, and Xiao-her
was charged with delivering it.

The letter demanded a formal fight in the People's Sports Stadium,
where there was plenty of space.  The stadium no longer hosted any kind
of sport now, competitive games having been condemned by Mao.  Athletes
had to devote themselves to the Cultural Revolution.

On the appointed day, Xiao-her's gang of several dozen boys waited on
the running track.  Two slow hours passed, then a man in his early
twenties limped into the stadium.

It was "Lame Man' Tang, a famous figure in the Chengdu underworld.  In
spite of his relative youth, he was treated with the respect normally
reserved for the old.

Lame Man Tang had become lame from polio.  His

father had been a Kuomintang official, and so the son was allocated an
undesirable job in a small workshop located in his old family house,
which the Communists had confiscated.  Employees in small units like
this did not enjoy the benefits available to workers in big factories,
such as guaranteed employment, free health services, and a pension.

His background had prevented Tang from going on to higher education,
but he was extremely bright, and became the defaao chief of the Chengdu
underworld.  Now he had come at the request of the other dock, to ask
for a truce.

He produced several cartons of the best cigarettes and handed them
around.  He delivered apologies from the other dock, and their promise
to foot the bills for the damaged house and the medical care.
Xiao-her's helmsman accepted: it was impossible to say no to Lame Man
Tang.

Lame Man Tang was soon arrested.  By the beginning of 1968, a new,
fourth stage of the Cultural Revolution had started.  Phase One had
been the teenage Red Guards;

then came the Rebels and the attacks on capitalist-roaders;

the third phase had been the factional wars among the Rebels.  Mao now
decided to halt the factional fighting.  To bring about obedience, he
spread terror to show that no one was immune.  A sizable part of the
hitherto unaffected population, including some Rebels, now became
victims.

New political campaigns were cranked up one after another to consume
new class enemies.  The largest of these witch hunts "Clean Up the
Class Ranks," claimed Lame Man Tang.  He was released after the end of
the Cultural Revolution in 1976, and in the early 1980s he became an
entrepreneur and a millionaire, one of the richest men in Chengdu.  His
dilapidated family house was returned to him.  He tore it down and
built a grand two-story edifice.

When the craze for discos hit China he was often to be seen sitting in
the most prominent spot, benignly watching the young boys and girls of
his entourage dancing while he slowly counted out a thick wad of bank
notes with emphatic, deliberate nonchalance, paying for the whole crowd
and reveling in his newfound power money.

The "Clean Up the Class Ranks' campaign ruined the lives of millions.
In one single case, the so-called Inner Mongolia People's Party affair,
some ten percent of the adult Mongolian population were subjected to
torture or physical maltreatment; at least twenty thousand died.  This
particular campaign was modeled on pilot studies of six factories and
two universities in Peking, which were under Mao's personal
supervision.  In a report on one of the six factories, the Xinhua
Printing Unit, there was a passage which read: "After this woman was
labeled a counterrevolutionary, one day when she was doing forced labor
and the guard turned his eyes away, she rushed up to the fourth floor
of the women's dormitory, jumped out of a window, and killed herself.
Of course, it is inevitable that counterrevolution ari should kill
themselves.  But it is a pity that we now have one less "negative
example."  Mao wrote on this report: "This is the best written of all
the similar reports I have read."

This and other campaigns were managed by the Revolutionary Committees
which were being set up all over the country.  The Sichuan Provincial
Revolutionary Committee was established on 1 June 1968.  Its leaders
were the same four people who had headed the Preparatory Committee the
two army chiefs and the Tings.  The committee included the chiefs of
the two major Rebel camps, Red Chengdu and 26 August, and some
'revolutionary officials."

This consolidation of Mao's new power system had profound effects on my
family.  One of the first results was a decision to withhold part of
the salaries of the capitalistroaders and only to leave each dependent
a small monthly cash allowance.  Our family income was cut by more than
half.  Although we were not starving, we could no longer afford to buy
from the black market, and the state supply of food was deteriorating
fast.  The meat ration, for instance, was half a pound per person per
month.  My grandmother worried and planned day and night to enable us
children to eat better, and to produce food parcels for our parents in
detention.

The next decision of the Revolutionary Committee was to order all the
capitalist-roaders out of the compound to make room for the new
leaders.  My family was assigned some rooms at the top of a three-story
house which had been the office of a now defunct magazine.  There was
no running water or toilet on the top floor.  We had to go downstairs
even to brush our teeth, or to pour away a cup of leftover tea.  But I
did not mind, because the house was so elegant, and I was thirsty for
beautiful things.

Unlike our apartment in the compound, which was in a featureless cement
block, our new residence was a splendid brick-and-timber double-fronted
mansion with exquisitely framed reddish-brown colored windows under
gracefully curving eaves.  The back garden was dense with mulberry
trees, and the front garden had a thick vine trellis, a grove of
oleander, a paper mulberry, and a huge nameless tree whose pepper like
fruit grew in little clusters inside the folds of its boat-shaped brown
and crispy leaves.  I particularly loved the ornamental bananas and
their long arc of leaves, an unusual sight in a nontropical climate.

In those days, beauty was so despised that my family was sent to this
lovely house as a punishment.  The main room was big and rectangular,
with a parquet floor.  Three sides were glass, which made it
brilliantly light and on a clear day offered a panoramic view of the
distant snowy mountains of west Sichuan.  The balcony was not made of
the usual cement, but of wood painted a reddish brown color, with
"Greek key' patterned railings.  Another room which opened onto the
balcony had an unusually high, pointed ceiling about twenty feet in
height with exposed, faded scarlet beams.  I fell in love with our new
residence at once.

Later I realized that in winter the rectangular room was a battlefield
of bitter winds from all directions through the thin glass, and dust
fell like rain from the high ceiling when the wind blew.  Still, on a
calm night, lying in bed with the moonlight filtering through the
windows, and the shadow of the tall paper mulberry tree dancing on the
wall, I was filled with joy.  I was so relieved to be out of the
compound and all its dirty politics that I hoped my family would never
go near it again.

I loved our new street as well.  It was called Meteorite Street,
because hundreds of years before a meteorite had fallen there.  The
street was paved with crushed cobblestones, which I much preferred to
the asphalt surface of the street outside the compound.

The only thing that reminded me of the compound was some of our
neighbors, who worked in my father's department and belonged to Mrs.
Shau's Rebels.  When they looked at us it was with expressions of
steely rigidity, and on the rare, unavoidable occasions when we had to
communicate, they spoke to us in barks.  One of them had been the
editor of the closed-down magazine, and his wife had been a
schoolteacher.  They had a boy of six called Jo-jo, the same age as my
brother Xiao-fang.  A minor government official, with a five-year-old
daughter, came to stay with them, and the three children often played
together in the garden.  My grandmother was anxious about Xiao-fang
playing with them, but she dared not forbid him our neighbors might
interpret this as hostility toward Chairman Mao's Rebels.

At the foot of the wine-red spiral staircase which led to our rooms was
a big half-moon-shaped table.  In the old days, a huge porcelain vase
would have been placed on it with a bouquet of winter jasmine or peach
blossom.  Now it was bare, and the three children often played on it.

One day, they were playing 'doctor': Jo-jo was the doctor, Xiao-fang a
nurse, and the five-year-old girl the patient.

She lay on her stomach on the table and pulled her skirt up for an
injection.  Xiao-fang held a piece of wood from the back of a broken
chair as his 'needle."  At this moment, the girl's mother came up the
sandstone steps onto the landing.  She screamed and snatched her
daughter off the table.

She found a few scratches on the child's inner thigh.

Instead of taking her to a hospital, she fetched some Rebels from my
father's office a couple of streets away.  A crowd soon marched into
the front garden.  My mother, who happened to be home for a few days
from detention, was immediately seized.  Xiao-fang was grabbed and
yelled at by the adults.  They told him they would 'beat him to death'
if he refused to say who had taught him to 'rape the girl."

They tried to force him to say it was his elder brothers.

Xiao-fang was unable to say a word, even to cry.  Jo-jo looked badly
scared.  He cried and said it was he who had asked Xiao-fang to give
the injection.  The little girl cried, too, saying she had not had her
injection.  But the adults shouted at them to shut up, and continued to
hector Xiaofang.  Eventually, at my mother's suggestion, the crowd,
jostling my mother and dragging Xiao-fang, stormed off to the Sichuan
People's Hospital.

As soon as they entered the outpatients' department, the angry mother
of the girl and the dramatically heated crowd started to make
accusations to the doctors, nurses, and the other patients: "The son of
a capitalist-roader has raped the daughter of a Rebel!  The
capitalist-roader parents must be made to pay!"  While the girl was
being examined in the doctor's room a young man in the corridor, a
complete stranger, shouted, "Why don't you grab the capitalistroader
parents and beat them to death?"

When the doctor finished examining the girl, she came out and announced
that there was absolutely no sign that the girl had been raped.  The
scratches on her legs were not recent, and they could not have been
caused by Xiao-fang's piece of wood which, as she showed the crowd, was
painted and smooth.  They were probably caused by climbing a tree.  The
crowd dispersed, reluctantly.

That evening, Xiao-fang was delirious.  His face was dark red and he
screamed and raved incoherently.  The next day, my mother carried him
to a hospital, where a doctor gave him a large dose of tranquilizers.
After a few days he was well again, but he stopped playing with other
children.  With this incident, he practically said goodbye to his
childhood at the age of six.

Our move to Meteorite Street had been left to the resources of my
grandmother and us five children.  But by then we had the help of my
sister Xiao-hong's boyfriend, Cheng-yi.

Cheng-yi's father had been a minor official under the Kuomintang and
had not been able to get a proper job after 1949, partly because of his
undesirable past and partly because he had TB and a gastric ulcer.  He
did odd jobs like street cleaning and collecting the fees at a communal
water tap.  During the famine he and his wife, who were living in
Chongqing, died from illnesses aggravated by starvation.

Cheng-yi was a worker in an airplane engine factory, and had met my
sister at the beginning of 1968.  Like most people in the factory, he
was an inactive member of its major Rebel group, which was affiliated
with 26 August.

In those days, there was no entertainment, so most Rebel groups set up
their own song-and-dance troupes, which performed the few sanctioned
songs of Mao quotations and eulogies.  Cheng-yi, who was a good
musician, was a member of one such troupe.  Though she was not in the
factory, my sister, who loved dancing, joined it, together with Plumpie
and Ching-ching.  She and Cheng-yi soon fell in love.  The relationship
came under pressure from all sides: from his sister and his fellow
workers, who were worried 'that a liaison with a capitalist-roader
family would jeopardize his future; from our circle of high officials'
children, who scorned him for not being 'one of us," and from the
unreasonable me, who regarded my sister's desire to

live her own life as deserting our parents.  But their love survived,
and sustained my sister through the following difficult years.  I soon
came to like and respect Cheng-yi very much, as did all my family. 
Because he wore glasses, we took to calling him "Specs."

Another musician from the troupe, a friend of Specs, was a carpenter
and the son of a truck driver.  He was a jolly young man with a
spectacularly large nose which made him look somewhat un-Chinese.  In
those days the only foreigners whose pictures we saw often were
Albanians, because tiny, faraway Albania was China's only ally even the
North Koreans were considered to be too decadent.

His friends nicknamed him "AI," short for "Albanian."

AI came with a cart to help us move to Meteorite Street.

Not wanting to overtax him, I suggested we leave some things behind.
But he wanted us to take everything.  With a nonchalant smile, he
clenched his fists and proudly flexed his taut, bulging muscles.  My
brothers poked the hard lumps with great admiration.

AI was very keen on Plumpie.  The day after the move, he invited her,
Ching-ching, and me to lunch at his home, one of the common windowless
Chengdu houses with mud floors, which opened directly onto the
pavement.  This was the first time I had been in one of these houses.
When we reached Al's street, I saw a group of young men hanging about
on the corner.  Their eyes followed us as they said a pointed hello to
AI.  He flushed with pride, and went over to talk to them.  He came
back with an animated smile on his face.  In a casual tone he said, "I
told them you were high officials' children, and that I had made
friends with you so I could lay my hands on privileged goods when the
Cultural Revolution is over."

I was stunned.  First, what he said seemed to suggest that people
thought officials' children had access to consumer goods, which was not
the case.  Second, I was amazed at his obvious pleasure at being
associated with us, and the prestige this clearly gave him in the eyes
of his friends.  At the moment when my parents were in detention and we
had just been thrown out of the compound, when the Sichuan
Revolutionary Committee had been established and the capitalist-roaders
had been ousted, when the Cultural Revolution seemed to have won, AI
and his friends still apparently took it for granted that officials
like my parents would come back.

I was to encounter a similar attitude again and again.

Whenever I went out of the imposing gate of our courtyard, I was always
aware of the stares from people on Meteorite Street, stares which were
a mixture of curiosity and awe.

It was clear to me that the general public regarded the Revolutionary
Committees, rather than the capitalistroaders, as transient.

In the autumn of 1968 a new type of team came to take over my school;
they were called "Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams."  Made up of
soldiers or workers who had not been involved in factional fighting,
their task was to restore order.  In my school, as in all others, the
team recalled all the pupils who had been in the school when the
Cultural Revolution started two years before, so they could be kept
under control.  Those few who were out of the city were tracked down
and summoned back by telegram.  Few dared to stay away.

Back at school, the teachers who had not fallen victim did no teaching.
They did not dare.  The old textbooks had all been condemned as
'bourgeois poison," and nobody was brave enough to write new ones.  So
we just sat in classes reciting Mao's articles and reading People's
Daily editorials.

We sang songs of Mao's quotations, or gathered to dance 'loyalty
dances," gyrating and waving our Little Red Books.

Making 'loyalty dances' compulsory was one of the major orders issued
by the Revolutionary Committees throughout China.  This absurd twisting
was mandatory everywhere:

in schools and factories, on the streets, in shops, on railway

My Siblings and~r Friends 5o3 platforms, even in hospitals for the
patients who could still move.

On the whole, the propaganda team sent to my school was fairly benign.
Others were not.  The one at Chengdu University was hand-picked by the
Tings because the university had been the headquarters of their enemy
Red Chengdu.  Yan and Yong suffered more than most.  The Tings
instructed the propaganda team to put pressure on them to condemn my
father.  They refused.  They later told my mother that they so admired
my father's courage that they decided to take a stand.

By the end of 1968, all university students in China had been summarily
'graduated' en masse, without any exam, assigned jobs, and dispersed to
every corner of the land.

Yan and Yong were warned that if they did not denounce my father, they
would have no future.  But they stuck to their guns.  Yan was sent to a
small coal mine in the mountains of east Sichuan.  This was just about
the worst job possible; the work conditions were extremely primitive
and there were virtually no safety measures.  Women, like men, had to
crawl down the pit on all fours to drag the coal baskets out.  Yan's
fate was partly the result of the twisted rhetoric of the time: Mme Mao
had been insisting on women doing the same kind of work as men, and one
of the slogans of the day was Mao's saying "Women can hold up half the
sky."  But women knew that when they were given the privilege of this
equality they were in for hard physical labor.

Immediately after the expulsion of university students, middle-school
pupils like me discovered that we were to be exiled to faraway rural
and mountainous areas to do backbreaking farm labor.  Mao intended me
to spend the rest of my life as a peasant.

22.  "Thought Reform through Labor'-To the Edge of the Himahyas
(January-June 1909)

In i 969 my parents, my sister, my brother Jin-ming, and I were
expelled from Chengdu one after another, and sent to distant parts of
the Sichuan wilderness.  We were among millions of urban dwellers to be
exiled to the countryside.

In this way, young people would not be roaming the cities with nothing
to do, creating trouble out of sheer boredom, and adults like my
parents would have a 'future."  They were part of the old
administration which had been replaced by Mao's Revolutionary
Committees, and packing them off to the sticks to do hard labor was a
convenient solution.

According to Mao's rhetoric, we were sent to the countryside 'to be
reformed."  Mao advocated 'thought reform through labor' for everyone,
but never explained the relationship between the two.  Of course, no
one asked for clarification.  Merely to contemplate such a question was
tantamount to treason.  In reality, everyone in China knew that hard
labor, particularly in the countryside, was always punishment.  It was
noticeable that none of Mao's

To the Edge of the Himalayas 505 henchmen, the members of the newly
established Revolutionary Committees, army officers and very few of
their children had to do it.

The first of us to be expelled was my father.  Just after New Year 1969
he was sent to Miyi County in the region of Xichang, on the eastern
edge of the Himalayas, an area so remote that it is China's satellite
launch base today.  It lies about 300 miles from Chengdu, four days'
journey by truck, as there was no railway.  In ancient times, the area
was used for dumping exiles, because its mountains and waters were said
to be permeated with a mysterious 'evil air."  In today's terms, the
'evil air' was subtropical diseases.

A camp was set up there to accommodate the former staff of the
provincial government.  There were thousands of such camps throughout
China.  They were called 'cadres' schools," but apart from the fact
that they were not schools, they were not just for officials either.
Writers, scholars, scientists, teachers, doctors, and actors who had
become 'useless' in Mao's know-nothing new order were also dispatched
there.

Among officials, it was not only capitalist-roaders like my father and
other class enemies who were packed off to the camps.  Most of their
Rebel colleagues were also expelled, as the new Sichuan Revolutionary
Committee could not accommodate anything like all of them, having
filled its posts with Rebels from other backgrounds like workers and
students, and with army men.

"Thought reform through labor' became a handy way of dealing with the
surplus Rebels.  In my father's depa,iment only a few stayed in
Chengdu.  Mrs.  Shau became deputy director of Public Affairs on the
Sichuan Revolutionary Committee.

All Rebel organizations were now disbanded.

The 'cadres' schools' were not concentration camps or gulags, but they
were isolated places of detention where the inmates had restricted
freedom and had to do hard labor under strict supervision.  Because
every cultivable area in China is densely populated, only in arid or
moun 506 "Thought Reform through Labor' tai nous areas was there space
to contain the exiles from the cities.  The inmates were supposed to
produce food and be self supporting.  Although they were still paid
salaries, there was lit He for them to buy.  Life was very harsh.

In order to prepare for his trip, my father was released from his place
of detention in Chengdu a few days before his departure.  The only
thing he wanted to do was to see my mother.  She was still being
detained, and he thought he might never see her again.  He wrote to the
Revolutionary Committee, as humbly as he could, begging to be allowed
to see her.  His request was turned down.

The cinema in which my mother was being kept was on what used to be the
busiest shopping street in Chengdu.

Now the shops were half empty, but the black market for semiconductor
parts which my brother Jin-ming frequented was nearby, and he sometimes
saw my mother walking along the street in a line of detainees, carrying
a bowl and a pair of chopsticks.  The canteen in the cinema did not
operate every day, so the detainees had to go out for their meals from
time to time.  Jin-ming's discovery meant we could sometimes see our
mother by waiting on the street.  Occasionally she did not appear with
the other detainees, and we would be consumed by anxiety.  We did not
know that those were the times when her psychopath guard was punishing
her by denying her permission to go and eat.  But perhaps the next day
we would catch sight of her, one among a dozen or so silent and
grim-looking men and women, their heads bowed, all wearing white
armbands with four sinister black characters: 'ox devil, snake
demon."

I took my father to the street for several days running, and we waited
there from dawn fill lunchtime.  But there was no sign of her.  We
would walk up and down, stamping our feet on the frost-covered pavement
to keep warm.  One morning, we were again watching the thick fog lift
to reveal the lifeless cement buildings, when my mother appeared.

Having seen her children many times on the street, she

To the Edge of the Himalayas 5o7 looked up quickly to see whether we
were there this time Her eyes met my father's.  Their lips quivered,
but no sounds came out.  They just locked eyes until the guard shouted
at my mother to lower her head.  Long after she had turned the corner,
my father stood gazing after her.

A couple of days later, my father was gone.  Despite his calm and
reserve, I detected signs his nerves were on the verge of snapping.  I
was desperately worried that he might go out of his mind again,
particularly now that he had to suffer his physical and mental torment
in solitude, without his family nearby.  I resolved to go and keep him
company soon, but it was extremely difficult to find transport to Miyi,
as public services to such remote areas were paralyzed.  So when I was
told some days later that my school was being dispatched to a place
called Ningnan, which was only about fifty miles from his camp, I was
delighted.

In January 1969, every middle school in Chengdu was sent to a rural
area somewhere in Sichuan.  We were to live in villages among the
peasants and be 'reeducated' by them.  What exactly they were supposed
to educate us in was not made specific, but Mao always maintained that
people with some education were inferior to illiterate peasants, and
needed to reform to be more like them.  One of his sayings was:
"Peasants have dirty hands and cowshitsodden feet, but they are much
cleaner than intellectuals."

My school and my sister's were full of children of capitalist-roaders,
so they were sent to particularly godforsaken places.  None of the
children of members of the Revolutionary Committees went.  They joined
the armed services, which was the only, and much cushier, alternative
to the countryside.  Starting at this time, one of the clearest signs
of power was for one's children to be in the army.

Altogether, some fifteen million young people were sent to the country
in what was one of the largest population movements in history.  It was
an indication of the order within the chaos that this was swiftly and
supremely well organized.  Everyone was given a subsidy to help buy
extra clothes, quilts, sheets, suitcases, mosquito nets, and plastic
sheets for wrapping up bedrolls.  Minute attention was paid to such
details as providing us with sneakers, water cans, and torches.  Most
of these things had to be manufactured specially, as they were not
available in the poorly stocked shops.  Those from poor families could
apply for extra financial help.  For the first year we were to be
provided by the state with pocket money and food rations, including
rice, cooking oil, and meat.  These were to be collected from the
village to which we were assigned.

Since the Great Leap Forward, the countryside had been organized into
communes, each of which grouped together a number of villages and could
contain anywhere from 2,000 to 20,000 households.  Under the commune
came production brigades which, in turn, governed several production
teams.  A production team was roughly equivalent to a village, and was
the basic unit of rural life.  In my school, up to eight pupils were
assigned to each production team, and we were allowed to choose with
whom we wanted to form a group.  I chose my friends from Plumpie's
form.  My sister chose to go with me instead of with her school: we
were allowed to opt to go to a place with a relative.  My brother
Jin-ming, though he was in the same school as I, stayed in Chengdu
because he was not yet sixteen, which was the cutoff age.  Plumpie did
not go either, because she was an only child.

I looked forward to Ningnan.  I had had no real experience of physical
hardship and lit He appreciated what it meant.  I imagined an idyllic
environment where there was no politics.  An official had come from
Ningnan to talk to us, and he had described the subtropical climate
with its high blue sky, huge red hibiscus flowers, foot-long bananas,
and the Golden Sand River the upper part of the Yangtze shining in the
bright sun, rippled by gentle breezes.

I was living in a world of gray mist and black wall slogans, and
sunshine and tropical vegetation were like a dream to

?

~v me.  Listening to the official, I pictured myself in a mountain of
blossoms with a golden fiver at my feet.  He mentioned the mysterious
'evil air' which I had read about in classical literature, but even
that added a touch of ancient eroticism.  Danger existed for me only in
political campaigns.

I was also eager to go because I thought it would be easy to visit my
father.  But I failed to notice that between us lay pathless mountains
10,000 feet high.  I have never been much good at maps.

On 27 January 1969, my school set off for Ningnan.

Each pupil was allowed to take one suitcase and a bedroll.

We were loaded into trucks, about three dozen of us in each.  There
were only a few seats; most of us sat on our bedrolls or on the floor.
The column of trucks bumped up and down country roads for three days
before we reached the border of Xichang.  We passed through the Chengdu
Plain and the mountains along the eastern edge of the Himalayas, where
the trucks had to put on chains.  I tried to sit near the back so I
could watch the dramatic snow showers and hail which whitened the
universe, and which almost instantly cleared into turquoise sky and
dazzling sunshine.  This tempestuous beauty left me speechless.  In the
distance to the west rose a peak almost 25,000 feet high, beyond which
lay the ancient wilderness in which were born many of the world's
flora.  I only realized when I came to the West that such everyday
sights as rhododendrons, chrysanthemums, most roses, and many other
flowers came from here.  It was still inhabited by pandas.

The second evening we entered a place called Asbestos County, named
after its major product.  Somewhere in the mountains, our convoy
stopped so we could use the toilets two mud huts containing round
communal pits covered with maggots.  But if the sight inside the toilet
was revolting, the one outside was horrifying.  The faces of the
workers were ashen, the color of lead, and devoid of any animation.

Terrified, I asked a nice propaganda team man, Dong-an,

5xo "Thought RqCorrn through Labor' who was taking us to our
destination, who these zombie like people were.  Convicts from a
lao-gai ('reform through labor') camp, he replied.  Because asbestos
mining was highly noxious, it was mainly done by forced labor, with few
safety or health precautions.  This was my first, and only, encounter
with China's gulag.

On the fifth day, the truck unloaded us at a granary at the top of a
mountain.  Propaganda publicity had led me to expect a ceremony with
people beating drums and pinning red paper flowers on the new arrivals
with great fanfare, but all that happened was that a commune official
came to meet us at the grain station.  He made a speech of welcome in
the stilted jargon of the newspapers.  A couple of dozen peasants were
there to help us with our bedrolls and suitcases.  Their faces were
blank and inscrutable, and their speech was unintelligible to me.

My sister and I walked to our new home with the two other girls and
four boys who made up our group.  The four peasants who carried some of
our luggage walked in complete silence, and did not seem to understand
the questions we put to them.  We fell into silence, too.  For hours we
trekked in single file, deeper and deeper into the great universe of
dark-green mountains.  But I was far too exhausted to notice their
beauty.  Once, after I had been struggling to support myself against a
rock to catch my breath, I looked around, into the distance.  Our group
seemed so insignificant amid the vast, boundless mountain world, with
no roads, no houses, and no other human beings in sight, only the wind
soughing through the forests, and the purling of hidden streams.  I
felt I was disappearing into a hushed, alien wilderness.

At dusk, we arrived at the lightless village.  There was no
electricity, and oil was too precious to be wasted if it was not
completely dark.  People stood by their doors and stared at us with
open-mouthed blankness; I did not know flit denoted interest or
indifference.  It was stares like these which many foreigners
encountered in China after it was first opened in the 197OS.  Indeed,
we were like foreigners to the peasants and they to us.

The village had prepared a residence for us, made of timber and mud and
comprising two big rooms one for the four boys, and one for the four
girls.  A corridor led to the village hall, where a brick stove had
been built for us to cook on.

I fell exhausted onto the hard plank of wood that was the bed I was to
share with my sister.  Some children followed us, making excited
noises.  They now started banging on our door, but when we opened it
they would scamper away, only to reappear to rap on the door again.
They peeped into our window, which was just a square hole in the wall,
with no shutter, and screamed odd noises.  At first we smiled and
invited them in, but our friendliness met no response.  I was desperate
for a wash.  We nailed an old shirt onto the window frame as a curtain
and began to dip our towels into the freezing water in our washbasins.
I tried to ignore the children's giggles as they repeatedly flipped up
the 'curtain."  We had to keep our padded jackets on while we washed.

One of the boys in our group acted as leader and liaison with the
villagers.  We had a few days, he told us, to get all our daily
necessities like water, kerosene, and firewood organized; after that we
would have to start working in the fields.

Everything at Ningnan was done manually, the way it had been for at
least 2,000 years.  There was no machinery and no draft animals,
either.  The peasants were too short of food to be able to afford any
for horses or donkeys.  For our arrival the villagers had filled a
round earthenware water tank for us.  The next day I realized how
precious every drop was.  To get water, we had to climb for thirty
minutes up narrow paths to the well, carrying a pair of wooden barrels
on a shoulder pole.  They weighed ninety pounds when they were full. My
shoulders ached agonizingly even when they were empty.  I was vastly
relieved when the boys gallantly declared
that fetching water was their job.

They cooked, too, as three out of us four girls, me included, had never
cooked in our lives, having come from the kind of families we did.  Now
I began to learn to cook the hard way.  The grain came un husked and
had to be put into a stone mortar and beaten with all one's might with
a heavy pestle.  Then the mixture had to be poured into a big shallow
bamboo basket, which was swung with a particular movement of the arms
so that the light shells gathered on top and could be scooped away,
leaving the rice behind.  After a couple of minutes my arms became
unbearably sore and soon were shaking so much I could not pick up the
basket.  It was an exhausting battle for every meal.

Then we had to collect fuel.  It was two hours' walk to the woods
designated by the forest protection regulations as the area where we
could collect firewood.  We were only allowed to chop small branches,
so we climbed up the short pines and slashed ferociously with our
knives.  The logs were bundled together and carried on our backs.  I
was the youngest in our group, so I only had to carry a basket of
feathery pine needles.  The journey home was another couple of hours,
up and down mountain paths.  I was so exhausted when I got back that I
felt my load must weigh 140 pounds at least.  I could not believe my
eyes when I put my basket on the scales: it came to only five pounds.

This would burn up in no lime: it was not enough even to boil a wok of
water.

On one of the first trips to gather fuel, I tore the seat of my
trousers getting down from a tree.  I was so embarrassed I hid in the
woods and came out last so no one could walk behind me and see.  The
boys, who were all perfect gentlemen, kept insisting I should go in
front so they would not walk too fast for me.  I had to repeat many
times that I was happy to go last, and that I was not just being
polite.

To the Edge of the Himalayas 513 Even going to the toilet was no easy
job.  It involved climbing down a steep, slippery slope to a deep pit
next To the goaffold.  One always had either one's bottom or one's head
toward the goats, who were keen to butt at intruders.

I was so nervous I could not move my bowels for days.

Once out of the goat fold it was a struggle to clamber up the slope
again.  Every time I came back I had new bruises on me somewhere.

On our first day working with the peasants, I was assigned to carry
goat droppings and manure from our toilet up to the tiny fields which
had just been burned free of bushes and grass.  The ground was now
covered by a layer of plant ash that, together with the goat and human
excrement, was to fertilize the soil for the spring plowing, which was
done manually.

I loaded the heavy basket on my back and desperately crawled up the
slope on all fours.  The manure was fairly dry, but still some of it
began to soak through onto my cotton jacket and through to my underwear
and my back.

It also slopped over the top of the basket and seeped into my hair.
When I finally arrived at the field I saw the peasant women skillfully
unloading by bending their waists sideways and tilting the baskets in
such a way that the contents poured out.  But I could not make mine
pour.  In my desperation to get rid of the weight on my back I tried to
take the basket off.  I slipped my right arm out of its strap, and
suddenly the basket lurched with a tremendous pull to the left, taking
my left shoulder with it.  I fell to the ground into the manure.  Some
time later, a friend dislocated her knee like this.  I only strained my
waist slightly.

Hardship was part of the 'thought reform."  In theory, it was to be
relished, as it brought one closer to becoming a new person, more like
the peasants.  Before the Cultural Revolution, I had subscribed
wholeheartedly to this naive attitude, and had deliberately done hard
work in order to make myself a better person.  Once in the spring of x
966 my form was helping with some roadwork.  The girls were asked to do
light jobs like separating out stones which were then broken up by the
boys.  I offered to do the boys' work and ended up with horribly
swollen arms from crushing stones with a huge sledgehammer which I
could hardly lift.  Now, scarcely three years later, my indoctrination
was collapsing.  With the psychological support of blind belief gone, I
found myself hating the hardship in the mountains of Ningnan.  It
seemed utterly pointless.

I developed a serious skin rash as soon as I arrived.  For over three
years this rash recurred the moment I was in the country, and no
medicine seemed able to cure it.  I was tormented by itchiness day and
night, and could not stop myself from scratching.  Within three weeks
of star fng my new life I had several sores running with pus, and my
legs were swollen from infections.  I was also hit by diarrhea and
vomiting.  I was hatefully weak and sick all the time when I needed
physical strength most, and the commune clinic was thirty-odd miles
away.

I soon came to the conclusion that I had lit He chance of visiting my
father from Ningnan.  The nearest proper road was a day's hard walk
away, and even when one got there, there was no public transport.
Trucks were few and far between, and they were extremely unlikely to be
going from where I was to Miyi.  Fortunately, the propaganda team man,
Dong-an, came to our village to check that we were settled in all
right, and when he saw I was ill he kindly suggested I should go back
to Chengdu for treatment.  He was returning with the last of the trucks
which had brought us to Ningnan.  Twenty-six days after I had arrived,
I set off back to Chengdu.

As I was leaving I realized that I had hardly got to know the peasants
in our village.  My only acquaintance was the village accountant who,
being the most educated man around, came to see us often to claim some
intellectual kinship.  His home was the only one I had been in, and
what I remember most were the suspicious stares on his young wife's
weather-beaten face.  She was cleaning the bloody intestines of a pig,
and had a silent baby on her back.  When I said hello, she shot me an
indifferent look and did not return my greeting.  I felt alien and
awkward, and soon left.

In the few days I actually worked with the villagers, I had lit He
spare energy and did not talk to them properly.

They seemed remote, uninterested, separated from me by the impenetrable
Ningnan mountains.  I knew we were supposed to make the effort to visit
them, as my friends and my sister, who were in better shape, were doing
in the evenings, but I was exhausted, sick, and itchy all the time.

Besides, visiting them would have meant that I was resigned to making
the best of my life there.  And I subconsciously refused to settle for
a life as a peasant.  Without spelling it out to myself, I rejected the
life Mao had assigned to me.

When the time came for me to leave, I suddenly missed the extraordinary
beauty of Ningnan.  I had not appreciated the mountains properly when I
was struggling with life there.  Spring had come early, in February,
and golden winter jasmines shone beside the icicles hanging from the
pines.  The brooks in the valleys formed one crystal-clear pool after
another, dotted around which were fancifully shaped rocks.  The
reflections in the water were of gorgeous clouds, canopies of stately
trees, and the nameless blossoms that elegantly wriggled out of the
cracks in the rocks.  We washed clothes in those heavenly pools, and
spread them on the rocks to dry in the sunshine and the crisp air. Then
we would lie down on the grass and listen to the vibration of the pine
forests in the breeze.  I would marvel at the slopes of distant
mountains opposite us, covered with wild peach trees, and imagine the
masses of pink in a few weeks' time.

When I reached Chengdu, after four interminable days of being thrown
about in the back of an empty truck, with constant stomach pains and
diarrhea, I went straight to the

5 x6 "Thought Rqbrm through Labor' clinic attached to the compound.
Injections and tablets cured me in no time.  Like the canteen, the
clinic was still open to my family.  The Sichuan Revolutionary
Committee was split and second-rate: it had not managed to organize a
functioning administration.  It had not even got around to issuing
regulations concerning many aspects of everyday life.  As a result, the
system was full of holes; many of the old ways continued, and people
were largely left to their own devices.  The managements of the canteen
and the clinic did not refuse to serve us, so we went on enjoying the
facilities.

in addition to the Western injections and pills prescribed at the
clinic, my grandmother said I needed Chinese medicines.  One day she
came home with a chicken and some roots of membranous milk vetch and
Chinese angelica, which were considered very bu (healing), and made a
soup for me into which she sprinkled finely chopped spring onions.
These ingredients were unavailable in the shops, and she had hobbled
for miles to buy them in a country black market.

My grandmother was unwell herself.  Sometimes I saw her lying on her
bed, which was extremely unusual for her;

she had always been so energetic I had hardly ever seen her sit still
for a minute.  Now her eyes were shut tight and she bit her lips hard,
which made me feel she must be in great pain.  But when I asked her
what the matter was, she would say it was nothing, and she continued
collecting medicines and standing in line to get food for me.

I was soon much better.  As there was no authority to order me to
return to Ningnan, I began to plan a trip to see my father.  But then a
telegram came from Yibin saying that my aunt Jun-ying, who had been
looking after my youngest brother, Xiao-fang, was seriously ill.  I
thought I should go and take care of them.

Aunt Jun-ying and my father's other relations in Yibin had been very
kind to my family, in spite of the fact that my father had broken the
deep-rooted Chinese tradition of looking after one's relatives.  By
tradition, it was considered the filial duty of a son to prepare for
his mother a heavy wooden coffin with many layers of paint, and to
provide a grand and often financially crippling- funeral.

But the government strongly encouraged cremation to save land and
simpler funerals.  When his mother died in 1958, my father was not told
until after the funeral, because his family was worried that he would
object to the burial and the elaborate service.  After we moved to
Chengdu his family hardly ever visited us.

However, when my father fell into trouble in the Cultural Revolution,
they came to see us and offered their help.  Aunt Jun-ying, who had
been traveling frequently between Chengdu and Yibin, eventually took
Xiao-fang under her care to relieve my grandmother of some of her
burden.  She shared a house with my father's youngest sister, but had
also selflessly given up half of her part to the family of a distant
relative who had had to abandon their own dilapidated lodgings.

When I arrived, my aunt was sitting in a wicker easy chair by the front
door to the hall, which served as the sitting room.  In the place of
honor lay a huge coffin made of heavy, dark-red wood.  This coffin, her
own, was her only indulgence.  The sight of my aunt overwhelmed me with
sadness.  She had just had a stroke, and her legs were half-paralyzed.
Hospitals were working only sporadically.

With no one to repair them, facilities had broken down and the supply
of medicine was erratic.  The hospitals had told Aunt Jun-ying there
was nothing they could do for her, so she stayed at home.

What my aunt found most traumatic were her bowel movements.  After
eating, she felt unbearably bloated, but she could not relieve herself
without great agony.  Her relatives' formulas helped sometimes, but
more often failed.  I massaged her stomach frequently, and once, when
she felt desperate and asked me to, I even put my finger into her anus
to try to scratch out the excrement.  All these remedies only gave her
momentary relief.  As a result, she did not dare to eat much.  She was
terribly weak, and would sit in the wicker chair in the hall for hours,
gazing at the papaya and banana trees in the back garden.  She never
complained.  Only once did she say to me in a gentle whisper, "I'm so
very hungry.  I wish I could eat..."

She could no longer walk without help, and even sitting up required a
great effort.  To prevent her getting bedsores, I would sit beside her
so she could lean on me.  She said I was a good nurse and that I must
be tired and bored sitting there.  No matter how much I insisted, she
would only sit for a brief period every day, so that I could 'go out
and have some fun."

Of course, there was no fun outside.  I longed for something to read.
But apart from the four volumes of The Seleaed Works of Mao Zedong, all
I discovered in the house was a dictionary.  Everything else had been
burned.  I occupied myself with studying the 15,000 characters in it,
learning the ones I did not know by heart.

I spent the rest of my time looking after my seven-year old brother,
Xiao-fang, and took long walks with him.

Sometimes he got bored and demanded things like a toy gun or the
charcoal-colored sweets that were on lonely display in the shops.  But
I had no money our basic allowance was small.  Xiao-fang, at seven,
could not understand this, and would throw himself on the dusty ground,
kicking, yelling, and tearing my jacket.  I would crouch and coax and
eventually, at my wits' end, start crying as well.

At this, he would stop and make up with me.  We would both go home
exhausted.

Yibin was a very atmospheric town, even in the middle of the Cultural
Revolution.  The waving rivers and serene hills, and the hazy horizon
beyond, produced a sense of eternity in me, and soothed me temporarily
from the miseries all around.  When dusk fell, the posters and
loudspeakers all over the city were obscured, and the unlit back lanes
were enveloped in mist, broken only by the flickering of oil lamps
seeping through the cracks between the frames of the doors and the
windows.  From time to time, there was a bright patch: a small food
stall was open.  There was not much for sale, but there would be a
square wooden table on the pavement, with four long narrow benches
around it, all dark brown and shiny from years of rubbing and sitting.
On the table would be a tiny pea-shaped spark - a lamp that burned
rapeseed oil.  There was never anyone sitting at these tables chatting,
but the owner kept the stall open.  In the old days, it would have been
crowded with people gossiping and drinking the local 'five-grained
liquor," accompanied by marinated beef, soy-stewed pig's tongue, and
salt-and-pepper roasted peanuts.  The empty stalls evoked for me a
Yibin in the days when life had not been completely taken over by
politics.

Once out of the back lanes, my ears were assaulted by loudspeakers. For
up to eighteen hours a day the town center was a perpetual hubbub of
chanting and denouncing.  Quite apart from the content, the noise level
was unbearable, and I had to develop a technique of forcing myself to
hear nothing to preserve my sanity.

One evening in April, a broadcast suddenly caught my attention.  A
Party Congress had been convened in Peking.

As usual, the Chinese people were not told what this most important
assembly of their 'representatives' was actually doing.  A new top
leadership team was announced.  My heart sank as I heard that the new
organization of the Cultural Revolution was confirmed.

This Congress, the Ninth, marked the formal establishment of Mao's
personal power system.  Few senior leaders from the previous Congress,
in 1956, had made it to this one.  Out of seventeen Politburo members,
only four Mao, Lin Biao, Zhou Enlai, and Li Xiannian were still in
office.  All the rest, apart from those already dead, had been
denounced and ousted.  Some of these were soon to die.

President Liu Shaoqi, the number-two man at the

Eighth Congress, had been under detention since 1967, and was
ferociously beaten at denunciation meetings.  He was denied medicine
for both his long-term illness, diabetes, and his newly caught
pneumonia, and was given treatment only when he was on the brink of
death because Mme Mao explicitly ordered that he be kept alive so the
Ninth Congress would 'have a living target."  At the Congress the
verdict that he was 'a criminal traitor, enemy agent, and scab in the
service of the imperialists, modern revisionists [Russians], and the
Kuomintang reactionaries' was read by Zhou Enlai.  After the Congress,
Liu was allowed to die, in agony.

Marshal Ho Lung, another former Politburo member and a founder of the
Communist army, died scarcely two months after the Congress.  Because
he had wielded power in the army, he was subjected to two and a half
years of slow torture, which, he said to his wife, was 'intended to
destroy my health so they can murder me without spilling my blood." The
torment included allowing him only a small can of water every day
during the boiling summer, cutting off all heating during the winter,
when the temperature remained well below zero for months on end, and
denying him medicine for his diabetes.  In the end, he died after a
large dose of glucose was administered when his diabetes got worse.

Tao Zhu, the Politburo member who had helped my mother at the start of
the Cultural Revolution, was detained under inhuman conditions for
nearly three years, which destroyed his health.  He was denied proper
treatment until his gallbladder cancer was far advanced and Zhou Enlai
sanctioned an operation.  But the windows in his hospital room were
permanently blacked out with newspapers, and his family was not allowed
to see him at his deathbed or after his death.

Marshal Peng Dehuai died of the same kind of drawn out torment, which
in his case lasted eight years, until 1974.  His last request was to
see the trees and the daylight outside his newspaper-covered hospital
windows, and it was turned down.

These and many similar persecutions were typical of Mao's methods in
the Cultural Revolution.  Instead of signing death warrants Mao would
simply indicate his intentions, and some people would volunteer to
carry out the tormenting and improvise the gruesome details.  Their
methods included mental pressure, physical brutality, and denial of
medical care or even the use of medicine to kill.  Death caused in this
way came to have a special term in Chinese: po-had zhi-si - 'persecuted
to death."  Mao was fully aware of what was happening, and would
encourage the perpetrators by giving his 'silent consent' (mo-xu). This
enabled him to get rid of his enemies without attracting blame. The
responsibility was inescapably his, but not his alone.  The tormentors
took some initiative.  Mao's subordinates were always on the lookout
for ways to please him by anticipating his wishes and, of course, to
indulge their own sadistic tendencies.

The horrible details of the persecutions of many top leaders were not
revealed until years later.  When they came out, they surprised no one
in China.  We knew all too many similar cases from our own
experience.

As I stood in the crowded square listening to the broadcast, the new
Central Committee was read out.  With dread I waited for the names of
the Tings.  And there they were - Liu Jie-ting and Zhang Xi-ting.  Now
I felt there was to be no end to my family's suffering.

Shortly afterward a telegram came saying my grandmother had collapsed
and taken to her bed.  She had never done anything like this before.
Aunt Jun-ying urged me to go home and look after her.  Xiao-fang and I
took the next train back to Chengdu.

My grandmother was approaching her sixtieth birthday, and her stoicism
had at last been conquered by pain.  She felt it piercing and moving
all over her body, then concentrating in her ears.  The doctors at the
compound clinic said it might be nerves, and that they had no cure for
it except that she should maintain a cheerful mood.  I took her to a
hospital half an hour's walk from Meteorite Street.

Ensconced in their chauffeur-driven cars, the new holders of power felt
little concern for how ordinary people had to live.  Buses were not
running in Chengdu, as they were not considered vital to the
revolution, and pedicabs had been banned, on the grounds that they
exploited labor.

My grandmother could not walk because of the intense pain.  She had to
sit on the luggage rack of a bicycle, with a cushion on it, holding on
to the seat.  I pushed the bicycle, Xiao-her propped her up, and
Xiao-fang sat on the crossbar.

The hospital was still working, thanks to the professionalism and
dedication of some of the staff.  On its brick walls, I saw huge
slogans from their more militant colleagues accusing them of 'using
work to suppress revolution' - a standard accusation for people
sticking to their jobs.  The doctor we saw had twitching eyelids and
black rings under her eyes, and I guessed she must be exhausted by the
throngs of patients, in addition to the political attacks she was
having to endure.  The hospital was bursting at the seams with
grim-looking men and women, some with bruised faces, others with broken
ribs lying on stretchers victims of denunciation meetings.

None of the doctors could diagnose what was wrong with my grandmother.
There was no X-ray machine or any other instrument to examine her
properly.  They were all broken.  My grandmother was given various
painkillers.

When these failed to work, she was admitted to the hospital.  The wards
were crowded, the beds jammed right up against each other.  Even the
corridors were lined with beds.  The few nurses rushing from ward to
ward could not manage to look after all the patients, so I decided to
stay with my grandmother.

I went home and got some utensils so I could cook for her there.  I
also brought a bamboo mattress which I spread under her bed.  At night
I was constantly awakened by her groaning, and I would climb out from
under my thin quilt and massage her, which soothed her temporarily.
From under the bed, the room smelled intensely of urine.  Everyone's
chamber pot was placed next to the bed.  My grandmother was very fussy
about cleanliness, and she would insist on getting up and going to the
toilet down the corridor even at night.  But the other patients did not
bother, and often the chamber pots were not emptied for days.  The
nurses were too busy to attend to such details.

The window by my grandmother's bed looked out over the front garden. It
was overgrown with weeds, and its wooden benches were collapsing. The
first time I looked out at it, several children were busy trying to
break off the few branches of a small magnolia tree that still had one
or two flowers on them.  Adults walked by indifferently.

Vandalism against trees had become too much a part of everyday life to
attract any attention.

One day, from the open window, I saw Bing, a friend of mine, getting
off his bicycle.  My heart started to leap, and my face suddenly felt
hot.  I quickly checked in the windowpane.  To look into a real mirror
in public was to invite condemnation as a 'bourgeois element."  I was
wearing a pink-and-white checked jacket, a pattern that had just been
allowed for young women's clothing.  Long hair was permissible again,
but only in two plaits, and I would dither for hours over how I should
do mine: Should they be close together or far apart?  Straight, or
curved a lit He at the ends?  Should the plaited part be longer than
the loose part, or vice versa?  The decisions, all minute, were
endless.  There were no state regulations about hairstyles or clothes.
It was what everyone else was wearing that determined the rules of the
day.  And because the range was so narrow, people were always looking
out for the tiniest variations.  It was a real test of ingenuity to
look different and attractive, and yet similar enough to every body
else so that nobody with an accusing finger could pinpoint what exactly
was heretical.

I was still wondering how I looked when Bing walked into the ward.  His
appearance was nothing out of the ordinary, but a certain air set him
apart.  He had a touch of cynicism, which was rare in those humorless
years.  I was very much drawn to him.  His father had been a
departmental director in the pre-Cultural Revolution provincial
government, but Bing was different from most other high officials'
children.

"Why should I be sent to the countryside?"  he said, and actually
succeeded in not going by obtaining an 'incurable illness' certificate.
He was the first person to show me a free intelligence, an ironic,
inquisitive mind which did not take anything for granted.  It was he
who first opened up the taboo areas in my mind.

Up to now, I had shunned any love relationship.  My devotion to my
family, which had been intensified by adversity, overshadowed every
other emotion.  Although within me there had always been another being,
a sexual being, yearning to get out, I had succeeded in keeping it
locked in.  Knowing Bing pulled me to the brink of an entanglement.

On this day, Bing turned up at my grandmother's ward with a black eye.
He said he had just been hit by Wen, a young man who had come back from
Ningnan as the escort for a girl who had broken her leg there.  Bing
described the fight with deliberate nonchalance, saying with a great
deal of satisfaction that Wen was jealous of him for enjoying more of
my attention and company.  Later, I heard Wen's story: he had hit Bing
because he could not stand 'that conceited grin of his."

Wen was short and stout, with big hands and feet and buck teeth.  Like
Bing, he was the son of high officials.  He took to rolling up his
sleeves and trouser legs and wearing a pair of straw sandals like a
peasant, in the spirit of a model youth in the propaganda posters.  One
day he told me he was going back to Ningnan to continue 'reforming'

himself.  When I asked why, he said casually, "To follow Chairman Mao.
Why else?  I'm Chairman Mao's Red Guard."  For a moment I was
speechless.  I had begun to assume that people only spouted this sort
of jargon on official occasions.  What was more, he had not put on the
obligatory solemn face that was part of the act.  The offhanded way he
spoke made me feel he was sincere.

Wen's way of thinking did not make me want to avoid him.  The Cultural
Revolution had taught me not to divide people by their beliefs, but by
whether they were capable of cruelty and viciousness or not.  I knew
Wen was a decent person, and when I wanted to get out of Ningnan
permanently, it was to him that I turned for help.

I had been away from Ningnan for over two months.

There was no rule that forbade this, but the regime had a powerful
weapon to make sure I would have to go back to the mountains sooner or
later: my residence registration had been moved there from Chengdu, and
as long as I stayed in the city, I was entitled to no food or any other
rations.  For the time being I was living off my family's rations, but
that could not last forever.  I realized that I had to get my
registration moved to somewhere near Chengdu.

Chengdu itself was out of the question, because no one was allowed to
move a country registration to a city.  Moving one's registration from
a harsh mountainous place to a richer area like the plain around
Chengdu was also forbidden.  But there was a loophole: we could move if
we had relatives who were willing to accept us.  It was possible to
invent such a relative, as no one could keep track of the numerous
relatives a Chinese might have.

I planned the transfer with Nana, a good friend of mine who was just
back from Ningnan to try to find a way to get out of there.  We
included my sister, who was still in Ningnan, in our plan.  To get our
registrations moved, we first of all needed three letters: one from a
commune saying it would accept us, on the recommendation of a relative
in that commune; a second from the county to which the commune
belonged, endorsing the first; and a third from the Sichuan Bureau for
City Youth, sanctioning the transfer.  When we had all three, we had to
go back to our production teams in Ningnan to obtain their approval
before the registrar at Ningnan county would give us the final release.
Only then could we be given the crucial document, which was essential
for every citizen in China our registration books which we had to hand
in to the authorities at our next place of residence.

Life was always as daunting and complex as this whenever one took even
the smallest step outside the authorities' rigid plan.  And in most
cases there were unexpected complications.  While I was planning how to
arrange the transfer, out of the blue the central government issued a
regulation freezing all registration transfers as of 11 June.

It was already the third week in May.  It would be impossible to locate
a real relative who would accept us and go through all the procedures
in time.

I turned to Wen.  Without hesitating for a moment, he offered to
'create' the three letters.  Forging official documents was a serious
offense, punishable by a long prison sentence.  But Mao's devoted Red
Guard shrugged off my words of caution.

The crucial elements in the forgery were the seals.  In China, all
documents are made official by the stamps on them.  Wen was good at
calligraphy, and could carve in the style of official stamps.  He used
cakes of soap.  In one evening all three letters for the three of us,
which would have taken months to obtain, if we were lucky, were
ready.

Wen offered to go back to Ningnan with Nana and me to help with the
rest of the procedure.

When the time came to go, I was agorfizingly torn, because it meant
leaving my grandmother in the hospital.

She urged me to go, saying she would return home and keep an eye on my
younger brothers.  I did not try to dissuade her: the hospital was a
terribly depressing place.

Apart from the revolting smell, it was also incredibly noisy,

7b the Edge of the Himalaya~ 52, with moaning and clattering and loud
conversations in the corridors day and night.  Loudspeakers woke eve
none up at six in the morning, and there were often deaths in full view
of other patients.

On the evening she was discharged, my grandmother felt a sharp pain at
the base of her spine.  She could not sit on the luggage rack of the
bicycle, so Xiao-her rode it home with her clothes, towels, washbowls,
thermos flasks, and the cooking utensils, and I walked with her,
supporting her.  The evening was sultry.  Walking even very slowly hurt
her, as I could see from her tightly pursed lips and her trembling as
she tried to suppress her moans.  I told her stories and gossip to
divert her.  The plane trees that used to shade the pavements now
produced only a few pathetic branches with leaves on them they had not
been pruned in the three years of the Cultural Revolution.  Here and
there, buildings were scarred, the result of the fierce fighting
between R/~bel factions.

It took us nearly an hour to get halfway.  Suddenly the sky turned
dark.  A violent gale swept up the dust and the torn fragments of wall
posters.  My grandmother staggered.

I held her tight.  It started to pour with rain, and in an instant we
were drenched.  There was nowhere to take cover, so we struggled on.
Our clothes were clinging to us and impeding our movements.  I was
panting for breath.

My grandmother's tiny, thin figure felt heavier and heavier in my arms.
The rain was hissing and splashing, the wind slashed against our soaked
bodies, and I felt very cold.  My grandmother sobbed, "Oh heaven, let
me die!  Let me die!"

I wanted to cry too, but I only said, "Grandma, we'll soon be home ....
'

Then I heard a bell tinkling.

"Hey, do you want a lift?"

A pedal-cart had pulled over; a young man in an open shirt was
straddling it, rain running down his cheeks.  He came over and carried
my grandmother onto the open cart on which an old man was crouching. He
nodded to us.  The young man said this was his father whom he was
taking home from the hospital.  He dropped us at our door, waving off
my profuse thanks with a cheerful "No trouble at all," before
disappearing into the sodden darkness.  Because of the pressure of the
downpour, I never learned his name.

Two days later my grandmother was up and about in the kitchen, rolling
out dumpling wrappings to give us a treat.  She started to tidy up the
rooms, too, in her usual nonstop way.  I could see she was overdoing
things and asked her to stay in bed, but she would not listen.

By now it was the beginning of June.  She kept telling me I should
leave, and insisted that Jin-ming should go as well, to look after me,
since I had been so sick last time in Ningnan.  Though he had just
turned sixteen, Jin-ming had not yet been assigned a commune.  I sent a
telegram asking my sister to come back from Ningnan and look after our
grandmother.  Xiao-her, fourteen at the time, promised that he could be
depended on, and seven-year-old Xiao-fang solemnly made the same
announcement.

When I went to say goodbye to her, my grandmother wept.  She said she
did not know whether she would ever see me again.  I stroked the back
of her hand, which was now bony, with bulging veins, and pressed it to
my cheek.

I suppressed the surge of tears and said I would be back very soon.

After a long search, I had finally found a truck going to the Xichang
region.  Since the mid-1960s Mao had ordered many important factories
(including the one where my sister's boyfriend Specs worked) to be
moved to Sichuan, particularly to Xichang, where a new industrial base
was being built.  Mao's theory was that the mountains of Sichuan
provided the best deterrent in case the Americans or the Russians
attacked.  Trucks from five different provinces were busy delivering
goods to the base.  Through a friend, a driver from Peking agreed to
take us -Jin-ming, Nana, Wen, and me.  We had to sit on the back of the
open truck because the cabin was reserved for the relief

To the Edge of the Hirnalqyas 5' (~ driver.  Every truck belonged to a
convoy which met up in the evening.

These drivers had the reputation of being happy to take girls but not
boys much the same as their brotherhood the world over.  Since they
were almost the only source of transport, this angered some boys. Along
the way I sa~' slogans pasted on the trunks of trees: "Strongly protest
the truckers who only take females and not males!"  Some bolder boys
stood in the middle of the road to try to force the trucks to stop. 
One boy from my school did not manage to leap away in time and was
killed.

From the lucky female hitchhikers, there were a few reports of rape,
but many more of romance.  Quite a few marriages resulted from these
journeys.  A truck driver who took part in the construction of the
strategic base enjoyed certain privileges, one being the right to
transfer his wife's country registration to the city where he lived.
Some girls jumped at this opportunity.

Our drivers were very kind, and behaved impeccably.

When we stopped for the night, they would help us secure a hotel bed
before going to their guesthouse, and they would invite us to have
supper with them so we could share their special food, free.

Only once did I feel there was something faintly sexual on their minds.
At one stop another pair of drivers invited Nana and me to go on their
truck for the next leg.  When we told our driver, his face fell a mile,
and he said in a sulky voice, "Go ahead then, go ahead with those nice
guys of yours if you like them better."  Nana and I looked at each
other and mumbled in embarrassment, "We didn't say we liked them
better.  You are all very nice to us .... We did not go.

Wen kept an eye on Nana and me.  He constantly warned us about drivers,
about men in general, about thieves, about what to eat and what not to
eat, and about going out after dark.  He also carried our bags and
fetched hot water for us.  At dinnertime, he would tell Nana, Jin-ming,
and

53o "Thought Reform through Labor' me to join the drivers to eat while
he stayed behind in the hotel to look after our bags, as theft was
rampant.  We brought food back for him.

There was never any sexual advance from Wen.  On the evening we crossed
the border into Xichang, Nana and I wanted to wash in the river,
because the weather was so hot and the evening so beautiful.  Wen found
us a quiet bend in the river where we bathed in the company of wild
ducks and twirling reeds.  The rays of the moon were pouring onto the
river, the image scattering into masses of sparkling silver rings.  Wen
sat near the road with his back studiously to us, keeping guard.  Like
many other young men, he had been brought up in the pre-Cultural
Revolution days to be chivalrous.

To get into a hotel, we needed to produce a letter from our unit.  Wen,
Nana, and I had each secured a letter from our production teams in
Ningnan, and Jin-ming had a letter from his school.  The hotels were
inexpensive, but we did not have much money, since our parents'
salaries had been drastically reduced.  Nana and I would get a single
bed between us in a dormitory and the boys would do the same.  The
hotels were filthy, and very basic.  Before going to bed, Nana and I
would turn the quilt over and over looking for fleas and lice.  The
hotel washbowls usually had rings of dark-gray or yellow dirt on them.
Trachoma and fungal infections were commonplace, so we used our own.

One night we were awakened about twelve o'clock by loud bangs on the
door: everyone in the hotel had to get up to make an 'evening report'
to Chairman Mao.  This farcical activity was in the same package as the
'1oyaIty dances."  It involved gathering in front of a statue or
portrait of Mao, chanting quotations from the Litfie Red Book, and
shouting "Long live Chairman Mao, long long live Chairman Mao, and long
long long live Chairman Mao!"

while waving the Litfie Red Book rhythmically.

Half awake, Nana and I staggered out of our room.

To the Edge of the Himalayas 53 l Other travelers were emerging in twos
and threes, rubbing their eyes, buttoning their jackets, and pulling up
the cotton backs of their shoes.  There was not a single complaint.  No
one dared.  At five in the morning we had to go through the same thing
again.  This was called 'morning request for instructions' from Mao.
Later, when we were on our way, Jin-ming said, "The head of the
Revolutionary Committee in this town must be an insomniac."

Grotesque forms of worshipping Mao had been part of our lives for some
time chanting, wearing Mao badges, waving the Little Red Book.  But the
idolatry had escalated when the Revolutionary Committees were formally
established nationwide by late 1968.  The committee members reckoned
that the safest and most rewarding course of action was to do nothing,
except promote the worship of Mao and, of course, continue to engage in
political persecutions.  Once, in a pharmacy in Chengdu, an old shop
assistant with a pair of impassive eyes behind gray-rimmed spectacles
murmured without looking at me, "When sailing the seas we need a
helmsman..."  There was a pregnant pause.  It took me a moment to
realize I was supposed to complete the sentence, which was a fawning
quotation from Lin Biao about Mao.  Such exchanges had just been
enforced as a standard greeting.  I had to mumble, "When making
revolution we need Mao Zedong Thought."

Revolutionary Committees all over China ordered statues of Mao to be
built.  A huge white marble figure was planned for the center of
Chengdu.  To accommodate it, the elegant ancient palace gate, on which
I had stood so happily only a few years before, was dynamited.  The
white marble was to come from Xichang, and special trucks, called
'loyalty trucks," were shipping the marble out from the mountains.
These trucks were decorated like floats in a parade, festooned with red
silk ribbons and a huge silk flower in front.  They made the journey
from Chengdu empty, as they were devoted exclusively to carrying the
marble.  The trucks which supplied Xichang returned to

Chengdu empty: they were not allowed to sully the material that was
going to form Mao's body.

After we said goodbye to the driver who had brought us from Chengdu we
hitched a lift on one of these 'loyalty trucks' for the last stretch to
Ningnan.  On the way we stopped at a marble quarry for a rest.  A group
of sweating workers, naked to the waist, were drinking tea and smoking
their yard-long pipes.  One of them told us they were not using any
machinery, as only working with their bare hands could express their
loyalty to Mao.  I was horrified to see a badge of Mao pinned to his
bare chest.  When we were back in the truck, Jin-ming observed that the
badge might have been stuck on with a plaster.  And, as for their
devoted quarrying by hand: "They probably don't have any machines in
the first place."

Jin-ming often made skeptical comments like this which kept us
laughing.  This was unusual in those days, when humor was dangerous.
Mao, hypocritically calling for 'rebellion," wanted no genuine inquiry
or skepticism.  To be able to think in a skeptical way was my first
step toward enlightenment.  Like Bing, Jin-ming helped to destroy my
rigid habits of thinking.

As soon as we entered Ningnan, which was about 5,000 feet above sea
level, I was hit by stomach trouble again.  I vomited up everything I
had eaten and the world seemed to be spinning around me.  But we could
not afford to stop.

We had to get to our production teams and complete the rest of the
transfer procedure by 21 June.  Since Nana's team was nearer, we
decided to go there first.  It was a day's walk through wild mountains.
The summer torrents roared down ravines across which there were often
no bridges.  While Wen waded ahead to test the depth of the water,
Jin-ming carried me on his bony back.  Often we had to walk on goat
trails about two feet wide at the edges of cliffs with sheer drops of
thousands of feet.  Several of my school friends had been killed
walking home along them at night.  The sun was blazing down, and my
skin

To the Edge of the Himala3,a.~ 53.;

began to peel.  I became obsessed with thirst, and drank all the water
from everybody's water cans.  When we came to a gully, I threw myself
on the ground and gulped down the cool liquid.  Nana tried to stop me.
She said even the peasants would not drink this water unboiled.  But I
was too wild with thirst to care.  Of course, this was followed by more
violent vomiting.

Eventually we came to a house.  It had several gigantic chestnut trees
in front, stretching out their majestic canopies.  The peasants invited
us in.  I licked my cracked lips and immediately made for the stove
where I could see a big earthenware bowl, probably containing rice
fluid.  Here in the mountains this was considered the most delicious
drink, and the owner of the house kindly offered it to us.

Rice fluid is normally white, but what I saw was black.  A whine burst
out from it, and a mass of flies lifted off from the jellied surface. I
stared into the bowl and saw a few casualties drowning.  I had always
been very squeamish about flies, but now I picked up the bowl, flicked
aside the corpses, and downed the liquid in great gulps.

It was dark when we reached Nana's village.  The next day, her
production team leader was only too glad to stamp her three letters and
get rid of her.  In the last few months the peasants had learned that
what they had acquired were not extra hands, but extra mouths to feed.
They could not throw the city youths out, and were delighted when
anyone offered to leave.

I was too sick to go on to my own team, so Wen set off alone to try to
secure the release of my sister and myselfi Nana and the other girls in
her team tried their best to nurse me.  I ate and drank only things
which had been boiled and reboiled many times, but I lay there feeling
miserable, missing my grandmother and her chicken soup.

Chicken was considered a great delicacy in those days, and Nana joked
that I somehow managed to combine turmoil in my stomach with an
appetite for the best food.  Nevertheless, she and the other girls and
Jin-ming went all out to try to purchase a chicken.  But the local
peasants did not eat or sell chickens, which they raised only for eggs.
They put this custom down to their ancestors' rules, but we were told
by friends that chickens here were infested with leprosy, which was
widespread in these mountains.  So we shunned eggs as well.

Jin-ming was determined to make me some soup like my grandmother's, and
put his bent for inven6on to practical use.  On the open platform in
front of the house, he propped up a big round bamboo lid with a stick
and spread some grain underneath.  He tied a piece of string to the
stick and hid behind a door, holding the other end of the string, and
placed a mirror in such a position that he could monitor what went on
under the half-open lid.  Crowds of sparrows landed to fight for the
gram, and sometimes a turtledove swaggered in.  Jin-ming would choose
the best moment to pull the string and bring down the lid.  Thanks to
his ingenuity, I had delicious game soup.

The mountains at the back of the house were covered with peach trees
now bearing ripe fruit, and Jin-ming and the gifts came back every day
with baskets full of peaches.

Jin-ming said I must not eat them uncooked, and made me jam.

I felt pampered, and spent my days in the hall, gazing at the faraway
mountains and reading Turgenev and Chekhov, which Jin-ming had brought
for the journey.  I was deeply affected by the mood in Turgenev, and
learned many passages from First Love by heart.

In the evenings, the serpentine curve of some distant mountains burned
like a dramatic fire dragon silhouetted against the dark sky.  Xichang
had a very dry climate, and forest protection rules were not being
enforced, nor were the fire services working.  As a result, the
mountains were burning day after day, only stopping when a gorge
blocked the way, or a storm doused the flames.

After a few days Wen returned with the permission from my production
team for my sister and me to leave.  We set off immediately to find the
registrar, although I was still weak, and could walk only a few yards
before my eyes became dazzled by a mass of sparkling stars.  There was
only a week left before 2I June.

We reached the county town of Ningnan, and found the atmosphere there
like wartime.  In most pans of China heavy factional fighting had
stopped by now, but in remote areas like this local battles continued.
The losing side was hiding in the mountains, and had been launching
frequent lightning attacks.  There were armed guards everywhere, mostly
members of an ethnic group, the Yi, a lot of whom lived in the deeper
recesses of the Xichang wilderness.

Legend had it that when they slept, the Yi did not lie down, but
squatted, burying their heads in the folds of their arms.

The faction leaders, who were all Han, talked them into doing the
dangerous jobs like fighting in the front line and keeping guard.  As
we searched the county offices for the registrar, we often had to
engage in long, involved explanations with the Yi guards, using hand
gestures, as we had no language in common.  When we approached, they
lifted their guns and aimed them at us, their fingers on the triggers,
and their left eyes narrowed.  We were scared to death, but had to look
nonchalant.  We had been advised that they would regard any
demonstration of fear as a sign of guilt, and react accordingly.

We finally found the registrar's office, but he was not there.  Then we
bumped into a friend who told us that he had gone into hiding because
of the hordes of city youth besieging him to sort out their problems.
Our friend did not know where the registrar was, but he told us about a
group of 'old city youth' who might.

"Old city youth' were ones who had gone to the countryside before the
Cultural Revolution.  The Party had been trying to persuade those who
had failed exams for high schools and universities to go and 'build a
splendid new socialist countryside' which would benefit from their
education.  In their romanic enthusiasm, a number of young

536 "Thought Rearm through Labor' people followed the Party's call. The
harsh reality of rural life, with no chance to escape, and the
realiTation of the regime's hypocrisy because no officials' children
ever went, even if they had failed their exams had turned many of them
into cynics.

This group of 'old city youth' was very friendly.  They gave us an
excellent meal of game and offered to find out where the registrar was.
While a couple of them went to look for him, we chatted with the
others, sitting on their spacious pine veranda facing a roaring fiver
called the Black Water.  On the high rocks above, egrets were balancing
on one long slender leg, raising the other in various balletic
postures.  Others were flying, fanning their gorgeous snow-white wings
with panache.  I had never seen these stylish dancers wild and free.

Our hosts pointed out a dark cave across the river.  From its ceiling
hung a rusty-looking bronze sword.  The cave was inaccessible because
it was right next to the turbulent river.  Legend had it that the sword
had been left there by the famous, wise prime minister of the ancient
kingdom of Sichuan, Marquis Zhuge Liang, in the third century.  He had
led seven expeditions from Chengdu to try to conquer the barbarian
tribes here in the Xichang area.  I knew the story well, and was
thrilled to see evidence of it before my eyes.  He captured the
chieftain of the tribes seven times, and each time he released him,
hoping to win him over by his magnanimity.  Six times, the Chieftain
was unmoved and continued his rebellion, but after the seventh time he
became wholeheartedly loyal to the Sichuanese king.  The moral of this
legend was that to conquer a people, one must conquer their hearts and
minds a strategy to which Mao and the Communists subscribed.  I vaguely
mused that this was why we had to go through 'thought reform' so that
we would follow orders willingly.  That was why peasants were set up as
models: they were the most unquestioning and submissive subjects.  On
reflection today, I think the variant of Nixon's adviser Charles Colson
spelled out the hidden agenda: When you have them by the balls, their
hearts and minds will follow.

My train of thought was interrupted by our hosts.  What we should do,
they enthusiastically advised, was drop a hint to the registrar about
our fathers' positions.

"He will slap the seal on in no time," declared one jolly-looking young
man.  They knew we were high officials' children because of the
reputation of my school.  I felt dubious about their advice.

"But our parents no longer hold these positions.

They have been labeled capitalist-roaders," I pointed out hesitantly.

"What does that matter?"  Several voices brushed aside my worry.

"Your father is a Communist veteran, right?"

"Right," I murmured.

"A high official, right?"

"Sort of," I mumbled.

"But that was before the Cultural Revolution.  Now..."

"Never mind that.  Has anyone announced his dismissal?

No?  That's all right, then.  You see, it's as clear as daylight that
the mandate of Party officials is not over.  He will tell you that' the
jolly young man pointed in the direction of the sword of the wise old
prime minister.  I did not realize at the time that, consciously or
subconsciously, people regarded Mao's personal power structure as no
alternative to the old Communist administration.  The ousted officials
would come back.  Meanwhile, the jolly young man was continuing,
shaking his head for emphasis: "No official here would dare to offend
you and create problems for himself in the future."  I thought of the
appalling vendettas of the Tings.  Of course, people in China would
always be alert to the possibility of revenge by those with power.

As we left, I asked how I should drop the hint to the registrar about
my father's position without sounding vulgar.  They laughed heartily.

"He is just like a peasant!  They don't have that kind of sensibility.
They won't be able to tell the difference anyway.  Just tell him
straight out: "My father is the head of"' I was struck by the scornful
tone

538 "Thought ReJbrrn through Labor' in their voices.  Later I
discovered that most city youth, old or new, developed a strong
contempt for the peasants after they had set fled down among them. 
Mao, of course, had expected the opposite reaction.

On 2o June, after days of desperately searching the mountains, we found
the registrar.  My rehearsal of how to drop the hint about my parents'
positions proved completely unnecessary.  The registrar himself took
the initiative by asking me: "What did your father do before the
Cultural Revolution?"  After many personal questions, put from
curiosity rather than necessity, he took a dirty handkerchief out of
his jacket pocket and unfolded it to reveal a wooden seal and a flat
fin box containing a sponge in red ink.  Solemnly he pressed the seal
into the sponge and then stamped our letters.

With that vital seal and by the skin of our teeth with less than
twenty-four hours to spare we had accomplished our mission.  We still
had to find the clerk in charge of our registration books, but we knew
that that was not going to be a big problem.  The authorization had
been obtained.  I relaxed immediately into stomach pains and
diarrhea.

I struggled back with the others to the county town.  It was dark by
the time we arrived.  We made for the government guesthouse, a drab
two-story building standing in the middle of a walled enclosure.  The
porter's lodge was empty, and there was no one visible on the grounds
either.

Most of the rooms were shut, but on the top floor some bedroom doors
were half open.

I entered one, after making sure there was no one in it.  An open
window looked out on some fields beyond a dilapidated brick wall.
Across the corridor was another row of rooms.  There was not a soul
around.  From some personal things in the room and a half-drunk mug of
tea, I gathered that someone had been staying here very recently.

But I was too tired to wonder why he or she and everyone else had
deserted the building.  Without even the energy to close the door, I
threw myself onto the bed and fell asleep fully dressed.

I was jolted awake by a loudspeaker chanting some quo~ tafions by Mao,
one being: "If the enemy won't surrender, we will eliminate them!"  I
was suddenly wide awake.  I realized our building was under attack.

The next thing I heard was the whine of bullets very close by, and
windows breaking.  The loudspeaker yelled out the name of some Rebel
organization, urging it to surrender.  Otherwise, it screeched, the
attackers would dynamite the building.

Jin-ming burst in.  Several armed men wearing rattan helmets were
rushing into the rooms opposite mine, which overlooked the front gate.
One of them was a young boy shouldering a gun taller than himself.
Without a word, they raced to the windows, smashed the glass with the
butts of their rifles, and started shooting.  A man who seemed to be
their commander told us hurriedly that the building had been the
headquarters of his faction, and was now being attacked by the
opposition.  We had better get out quickly but not down the stairs,
which led to the front.  How then?

We frantically tore the sheets and quilt covers off the bed and made a
sort of rope.  We fled one end of it to a window frame and scrambled
down the two stories.  As we landed, bullets whistled and hissed into
the hard mud around us.  We bent double and ran for the collapsed
wall.

Once over it, we kept running for a long time before we felt safe
enough to stop.  The sky and the maize fields were beginning to show
their pale features.  We made for a friend's place in a nearby commune
to catch our breath and decide what to do next.  On the way, we heard
from some peasants that the guesthouse had been blown up.

At our friend's place, a message was waiting for me.  A telegram from
my sister in Chengdu had arrived just after we had left Nana's village
in search of the registrar.  As no one knew where I was, my friends had
opened it and passed

54o "Thought ReJbrm through Labor' the message around so that whoever
saw me could let me know.

This was how I learned that my grandmother was dead.

23.  "The More Books You Read, the More Stupid You Become'B I Work as a
Peasant and a Barefoot Doctor

(lune 1969-1971)

Jin-ming and I sat on the bank of the Golden Sand River, waiting for a
ferry.  I rested my head on my hands and stared at the unruly river
tumbling past me on its long journey from the Himalayas to the sea.  It
was to become the longest fiver in China the Yangtze, after joining the
Min River at Yibin, 300 miles downstream.

Toward the end of its journey, the Yangtze spreads and meanders,
irrigating vast areas of flat farmland.  But here, in the mountains, it
was too violent to build a bridge across it.  Only ferries linked
Sichuan province with Yunnan to the east.  Every summer, when the
torrent was high and fierce with the melted snow, the river claimed
lives.  Just a few days before, it had swallowed a ferry with three of
my schoolmates in it.

Dusk was descending.  I felt very ill.  Jin-ming had spread his jacket
on the ground for me so I would not have to sit on the damp grass.  Our
aim was to cross over to Yunnan and try to hitch a lift to Chengdu. The
roads through Xichang were cut off by fighting between Rebel factions,
so we had to try a roundabout route.  Nana and Wen had offered to get
my registration book and luggage, and those of Xiao-hong, to Chengdu.

A dozen strong men rowed the ferry against the current, chanting a song
in unison.  When they reached the middle of the river, they stopped and
let the ferry be carried downstream toward the Yunnan side.  Huge waves
broke over us several times.  I had to hold on tight to the side while
the boat listed helplessly.  Normally I would have been terrified, but
now I felt only numbness.  I was too preoccupied with the death of my
grandmother.

A solitary truck stood on a basketball court in the town on the Yunnan
bank, Qjaojia.  The driver readily agreed to give us a lift in the
back.  All the time, I kept turning over in my head what I could have
done to save my grandmother.  As the truck jolted along, we passed
banana groves at the back of mud houses in the embrace of cloud-capped
mountains.  Seeing the gigantic banana leaves, I remembered the small,
potted, fruitless banana by the door of my grandmother's hospital ward
in Chengdu.  When Bing came to see me, I used to sit beside it with
him, chatting deep into the night.  My grandmother did not like him
because of his cynical grin and the casualness with which he treated
adults, which she considered disrespectful.  Twice she came staggering
downstairs to call me back.

I had hated myself for making her anxious, but I could not help it.  I
could not control my desire to see Bing.  Now how I wished I could
start all over again!  I would not do anything to upset her.  I would
just make sure she got better although how I did not know.

We passed through Yibin.  The road wound down Emerald Screen Hill on
the edge of the city.  Staring at the elegant redwoods and bamboo
groves, I thought back to April, when I had just returned home to
Meteorite Street from Yibin.  I was telling my grandmother how I had
gone

I Work as a Peasant and a Barefoot Doctor 543 to sweep Dr.  Xia's tomb,
which was on the side of this hill, on a sunny spring day.  Aunt
Jun-ying had given me some special 'silver money' to burn at the tomb.
God knows where she had got it from, as it had been condemned as
'feudal."  I searched up and down for hours, but could not find the
tomb.  The hillside was a battered mess.  The Red Guards had leveled
the cemetery and smashed the tombstones, as they considered burial an
'old' practice.  I can never forget the intense flame of hope in my
grandmother's eyes when I mentioned the visit, and how it darkened
almost immediately when I stupidly added that the tomb was lost.  Her
look of disappointment had been haunting me.  Now I kicked myself for
not telling her a white lie.

But it was too late.

When Jin-ming and I got home, after more than a week on the road, there
was only her empty bed.  I remembered seeing her stretched out on it,
her hair loose but still tidy, biting her lips hard, her cheeks sunken.
She had suffered her murderous pains in silence and composure, never
screaming, never writhing.  Because of her stoicism, I had failed to
realize how serious her illness was.

My mother was in detention.  What Xiao-her and Xiaohong told me about
Grandmother's last days caused me such anguish that I had to ask them
to stop.  It was only years later that I learned what had happened
after I left.

She would do some housework, then go back to bed and lie there with her
face taut, trying to fight back the pain.

She constantly murmured that she was anxious about my trip, and worried
about my younger brothers.

"What will become of the boys, with no schools?"  she would sigh.

Then one day she could not get out of bed.  No doctor would come to the
house, so my sister's boyfriend, Specs, carried her to the hospital on
his back.  My sister walked by his side, propping her up.  After a
couple of journeys, the doctors asked them not to come anymore.  They
said they could find nothing wrong with her and there was nothing they
could do.

So she lay in bed, waiting for death.  Her body became lifeless bit by
bit.  Her lips moved from time to time, but my sister and brothers
could hear nothing.  Many times they went to my mother's place of
detention to beg for her to be permitted to come home.  Each time, they
were turned away without being able to see her.

My grandmother's entire body seemed to be dead.  But her eyes were
still open, looking around expectantly.  She would not close them until
she had seen her daughter.

At last my mother was allowed home.  Over the next two days, she did
not leave my grandmother's bedside.  Every now and then, my grandmother
would whisper something to her.  Her last words were about how she had
fallen into this pain.

She said the neighbors belonging to Mrs.  Shau's group had held a
denunciation meeting against her in the courtyard.  The receipt for the
jewelry she had donated during the Korean War had been confiscated by
some Rebels in a house raid.  They said she was 'a stinking member of
the exploiting class," otherwise how could she have acquired all that
jewelry in the first place?

My grandmother said she had had to stand on a small table.  The ground
was uneven and the table wobbled, and she felt dizzy.  The neighbors
were yelling at her.  The woman who had accused Xiao-fang of raping her
daughter hit one leg of the table ferociously with a club.  My
grandmother could not keep her balance and fell backwards onto the hard
ground.  She said she had felt a sharp pain ever since.

In fact, there had been no denunciation meeting.  But that was the
image that haunted my grandmother to her last breath.

On the third day after my mother came home, my grandmother died.  Two
days later, immediately after my grandmother was cremated, my mother
had to return to detention.

I have often dreamed of my grandmother since, and

I Work as a Peasant and a Barqbot Doctor 545 awakened sobbing.  She was
a great character vivacious, talented, and immensely capable.  Yet she
had no outlet for her abilities.  The daughter of an ambitious
small-town policeman, concubine to a warlord, stepmother to an extended
but divided family, and mother and mother-inlaw to two Communist
officials in all these circumstances she had little happiness.  The
days with Dr.  Xia were lived under the shadow of their past, and
together they endured poverty, Japanese occupation, and the civil war.
She might have found happiness in looking after her grandchildren, but
she was rarely free from anxiety about us.  Most of her life she had
lived in fear, and she faced death many times.

She was a strong woman, but in the end the disasters which hit my
parents, the worries about her grandchildren, the tide of ugly human
hostility all conspired to crush her.

But the most unbearable thing for her was what happened to her
daughter.  It was as though she felt in her own body and soul every bit
of the pain that my mother suffered, and she was finally killed by the
accumulation of anguish.

There was another, more immediate factor in her death:

she was denied proper medical care and could not be looked after, or
even seen, by her daughter when she was fatally ill.  Because of the
Cultural Revolution.  How could the revolution be good, I asked myself,
when it brought such human destruction, for nothing?  Over and over
again, I told myself I hated the Cultural Revolution, and I felt even
worse because there was nothing I could do.

I blamed myself for not looking after my grandmother as well as I might
have.  She was in the hospital at the time when I had come to know Bing
and Wen.  My friendships with them had cushioned and insulated me, and
had blunted my awareness of her suffering.  I told myself it was
despicable to have had any happy feelings at all, by the side of what
I'now realized was my grandmother's deathbed.  I resolved never to have
a boyfriend again.  Only by self denial I thought, could I expiate some
of my guilt.

The next two months I stayed in Chengdu, desperately looking, with Nana
and my sister, for a 'relative' nearby whose commune would accept us.
We had to find one by the end of the autumn harvest when food was
distributed, otherwise we would have nothing to eat for the following
year our state supply ran out in January.

When Bing came to see me, I was very cold to him, and told him never to
come again.  He wrote me letters but I threw them into the stove
without opening them- a gesture I had perhaps picked up from Russian
novels.  Wen came back from Ningnan with my registration book and
luggage, but I refused to see him.  Once I passed him on the street,
and looked straight through him, catching only a glimpse of his eyes,
in which I saw confusion and hurt.

Wen returned to Ningnan.  One summer day in 197o, a forest fire broke
out near his village.  He and a friend rushed out with a couple of
brooms to try to put it out.  A gust of wind threw a ball of flames
into his friend's face, leaving him permanently disfigured.  The two of
them left Ningnan and crossed into Laos, where there was a war going on
between left-wing guerrillas and the United States.  At the time a
number of high officials' children were going to Laos and Vietnam to
fight the Americans secretly, as it was forbidden by the government.
These young people had become disillusioned with the Cultural
Revolution, and hoped they could get back their youthful adrenaline by
taking on the "US imperialists."

One day soon after they got to Laos, Wen heard the alarm which signaled
that American planes were coming.

He was the first to leap up and charge out, but in his inexperience he
stepped on a mine which his comrades had planted themselves.  He was
blown to smithereens.  My last memory of him is his perplexed and
wounded eyes watching me from a muddy street corner in Chengdu.

Meanwhile, my family was scattered.  On I7 October 1969 Lin Biao
ordered the country into a state of war, using as a pretext clashes
which had broken out earlier that year on

I Work as a Peasant and a Baredhot Doctor 547 the border with the
Soviet Union.  In the name of 'evacuation," he sent his opponents in
the army and the disgraced top leaders out of the capital and placed
them under house arrest or detention in different parts of China.  The
Revolutionary Committees used this opportunity to speed up the
deportation of 'undesirables."  The 500 members of my mother's Eastern
District staff were ordered out of Chengdu to a place in the Xichang
hinterland called Buffalo Boy Flatland.  My mother was allowed ten days
at home from detention to make arrangements.  She put Xiao-her and
Xiao-fang on a train to Yibin.  Although Aunt Jun-ying was
half-paralyzed, there were other aunts and uncles there who could look
after them.  Jin-ming had been sent by his school to a commune fifty
miles northeast of Chengdu.

At the same time Nana, my sister, and I finally found a commune that
would take us in a county called Deyang, not far from where Jin-ming
was.  Specs, my sister's boyfriend, had a colleague from the county who
was prepared to claim we were his cousins.  Some communes in the area
needed more farmhands.  Although we had no proof of kinship, no one
asked any questions.  The only thing that mattered was that we were or
at least seemed to be extra labor.

We were allocated to two different production teams, because two extra
people was the maximum any one team could accommodate.  Nana and I went
to one team and my sister to another, three miles away.  The railway
station was about five hours' walk away, much of it along eighteen
inch-wide ridges between rice paddies.

My family of seven was now dispersed in six different places.  Xiao-her
was happy to leave Chengdu, where the new Chinese-language textbook at
his school, compiled by some teachers and members of the propaganda
team there, contained a condemnation of my father by name, and Xiaohei
was ostracized and bullied.

In the early summer of 1969, his school had been sent to the
countryside on the outskirts of Chengdu to help with the harvest.  The
boys and girls camped separately in two large halls.  In the evenings,
under the starry vault of the sky, the paths between the paddy fields
were frequented by young couples.  Romance bloomed, not least in the
heart of my fourteen-year-old brother, who started to fancy a girl in
his group.  After days of summoning up his courage, he nervously
approached her one afternoon when they were cutting wheat, and invited
her to go for a walk that evening.  The girl bent her head and said
nothing.  Xiao-her thought this was a sign of 'silent consent,"
mo-xu.

He leaned on a haystack in the moonlight, and waited with all the
anxieties and longings of first love.  Suddenly, he heard a whistle.  A
gang of boys from his form appeared.

They shoved him around and called him names, then they threw a jacket
over his head and started to hit and kick him.  He managed to break
free, and staggered to the door of one of the teachers and shouted for
help.  The teacher opened the door, but pushed him away, saying, "I
can't help you!  Don't you dare come back!"

Xiao-her was too frightened to return to his camp, and spent the night
hiding in a haystack.  He realized it was his 'sweetheart' who had
called in the bullies: she had felt insulted that the son of a
'counterrevolutionary capitalistroader' should have the audacity to
fancy her.

When they returned to Chengdu, Xiao-her went to his street gang for
help.  They appeared at his school with much flaunting of muscles, and
a gigantic wolfhound, and hauled the leading bully out of the
classroom.  He was shaking, his face ashen.  But before the gang set
upon him, Xiao-her was overtaken by pity, and asked his helmsman to let
the boy go.

Pity had become an alien concept, and was seen as a sign of stupidity.
Xiao-her was bullied even more than before.  He made a feeble attempt
at enlisting the help of his gang again, but they told him they would
not help a 'shrimp."

Xiao-her approached his new school in Yibin dreading more bullying.  To
his amazement, he received a warm.

almost emotional welcome.  The teachers, the propaganda team members
who were running the school, the children all seemed to have heard of
my father and referred to him with open admiration.  Xiao-her
immediately acquired a certain prestige.  The prettiest girl in the
school became his girlfriend.  Even the most thuggish boys treated him
with respect.  It was clear to him that my father was a revered figure
in Yibin, in spite of the fact that everyone knew he was in disgrace,
and the Tings were in power.

The population of Yibin had suffered horribly under the Tings.
Thousands had died or been injured in the factional fighting or under
torture.  One family friend escaped death because when his children
went to collect his corpse in the morgue, they found he was still
breathing.

People in Yibin had developed a great yearning for the days of peace,
for officials who did not abuse their power, for a government that was
dedicated to getting things to work.  The focus of this nostalgia was
the early 195os, when my father was the governor.  It was then that the
Communists were at their most popular just after they had replaced the
Kuomintang, put an end to starvation, and established law and order,
but before their incessant political campaigns (and their own,
Mao-induced famine).

My father became identified in the folk memory with the good old days.
He was seen as the legendary good official, in stark contrast with the
Tings.

Because of him, Xiao-her enjoyed his stay in Yibin although he learned
lit He at school.  Teaching materials still consisted of Mao's works
and People's Daily articles, and no one had any authority over the
pupils since Mao had not retracted his blanket dismissal of formal
learning.

The teachers and the workers' propaganda team tried to enlist
Xiao-her's help to enforce discipline in his class.

But here even my father's reputation failed, and Xiao-her was
eventually ostracized by some of the boys for being the teacher's
'lackey."  A whispering campaign began claiming that he had embraced
his girlfriend under lampposts in the street, which was a 'bourgeois
crime."  Xiao-her lost his privileged position and was told to write
self-criticisms and to pledge to carry out thought reform.  The girl's
mother turned up one day insisting on a surgical examination to prove
her daughter's chastity.  After a big scene, she took her daughter out
of the school.

Xiao-her had one close friend in his class, a popular boy of seventeen
who had one sensitive spot: his mother had never married, but had five
children all with different and unknown fathers, which was extremely
unusual in a society where 'illegitimacy' was heavily stigmatized, in
spite of having been formally abolished.  Now, in one of the
witch-hunting tides, she was publicly humiliated as a 'bad element."
The boy felt very ashamed of his mother, and told Xiao-her in private
that he hated her.  One day the school was awarding a best-swimmer
prize (because Mao liked swimming), and Xiao-her's friend was
unanimously nominated by the pupils; but when the award was announced,
it was not to him.  Apparently one young woman teacher had objected:
"We can't give it to him: his mother is a "worn shoe."

When the boy heard this, he grabbed a kitchen chopper and stormed into
the teacher's office.  Someone stopped him while the teacher scuttled
off and hid.  Xiao-her knew how much this incident had hurt his friend:
for the first time, the boy was seen weeping bitterly.  That night,
Xiaohei and some of the other boys sat up with him, trying to comfort
him.  The next day, he disappeared.  His corpse was washed up on the
bank of the Golden Sand River.  He had tied his hands together before
he jumped.

The Cultural Revolution not only did nothing to modernize the medieval
elements in China's culture, it actually gave them political
respectability.

"Modern' dictatorship and ancient intolerance fed on each other.  Any
one who fell foul of the age-old conservative attitude, could now
become a political victim.

My new commune in Deyang was in an area of low hills dotted with shrubs
and eucalyptus trees.  Most of the farmland was good, producing two
major harvests a year, one of wheat and one of rice.  Vegetables,
rapeseed, and sweet potatoes grew in abundance.  After Ningnan, the
biggest relief for me was that we did not have to do any climbing, and
I could breathe normally instead of panting for breath all the time.  I
did not mind the fact that walking here meant staggering along narrow,
muddy ridges between paddy fields.  I often fell on my bottom, and
sometimes in a grab for support I would push the person in front
usually Nana into a rice paddy.  Nor did I mind another peril of
walking at night: the possibility of being bitten by dogs, quite a few
of which had rabies.

When we first arrived, we stayed next to a pigsty.  At night, we fell
asleep to a symphony of pigs grunting, mosquitoes whining, and dogs
barking.  The room smelled permanently of pig manure and anti-mosquito
incense.  After a while the production team built Nana and me a
two-room cottage on a plot of land which had been used for cutting mud
bricks.  The land was lower than the rice paddy which lay just across a
narrow footpath, and in spring and summer, when the paddy He Ids were
filled with water, or after heavy rain, marshy water would ooze up from
the mud floor.  Nana and I had to take off our shoes, roll up our
trouser legs, and wade into the cottage.  Fortunately the double bed we
shared had tall legs, so we slept about two feet above the muddy water.
Getting into bed involved putting a bowl of clean water on a stool,
climbing up onto the stool, and washing our feet.  Living in these damp
conditions, my bones and muscles ached all the time.

But the cottage was also fun.  When the flood receded, mushrooms would
spring up under the bed and in the corners of the rooms.  With a little
imagination, the floor
looked like something out of a fairy tale.  Once I dropped a spoonful
of peas on the ground.  After the water had come and gone, a cluster of
delicate petals unfolded from slender stems, as though they had just
awakened to the rays of the sun, which brimmed through the wood-framed
opening in the wall which was our window.

The view was perpetually magical to me.  Beyond our door lay the
village pond, overgrown with water lilies and lotuses.  The path in
front of the cottage led up to a pass in the hill about 35o feet above
us.  The sun set behind it, framed by black rocks.  Before darkness
fell, silver mist would hang over the fields at the foot of the hills.
Men, women, and children walked back to the village after their day's
work in the evening haze, carrying baskets, hoes, and sickles, and were
met by their dogs who yapped and leaped about them.  They looked as
though they were sailing in clouds.  Smoke curved out from the thatched
cottages.

Wooden barrels clicked at the stone well, as people fetched water for
the evening meal.  Loud voices were heard as people chatted by the
bamboo groves, the men squatting and puffing their long, slender pipes.
Women neither smoked nor squatted: these were traditionally considered
unbecoming for women, and no one in 'revolutionary' China had talked
about changing these attitudes.

It was in Deyang that I came to know how China's peasants really lived.
Each day started with the production team leader allocating jobs.  All
the peasants had to work, and they each earned a fixed number of' work
points' gong fen for their day's work.  The number of work points
accumulated was an important element in the distribution at the end of
the year.  The peasants got food, fuel, and other daily necessities,
plus a tiny sum of cash, from the production team.  After the harvest,
the production team paid part of it over as tax to the state.  Then the
rest was divided up.  First, a basic quantity was meted out equally to
every male, and about a quarter less to every female.

Children under three received a half portion.  Since a child just over
three obviously could not eat an adult's share, iT was desirable to
have more children.  The system functioned as a positive disincentive
to birth control.

The remainder of the crop was then distributed according to how many
work points each person had earned.

Twice a year, the peasants would all assemble to fix the daily work
points for each person.  No one missed these meetings.  In the end,
most young and middle-aged men would be allocated ten points a day, and
women eight.

One or two whom the whole village acknowledged to be exceptionally
strong got an extra point.

"Class enemies' like the former village landlord and his family got a
couple of points less than the others, in spite of the fact that they
worked no less hard and were usually given the toughest jobs.  Nana and
I, being inexperienced 'city youth," got four the same number as
children barely in their teens; we were told this was 'to start with,"
though mine were never raised.

Since there was little variation from individual to individual of the
same gender in terms of daily points, the number of work points
accumulated depended mainly on how many days one worked, rather than
how one worked.

This was a constant source of resentment among the villagers in
addition to being a massive discouragement to efficiency.  Every day,
the peasants would screw up their eyes to watch how the others were
working in case they themselves were being taken advantage of.  No one
wanted to work harder than others who earned the same number of work
points.  Women felt bitter about men who sometimes did the same kind of
job as they, but earned two points more.  There were constant
arguments.

We frequently spent ten hours in the fields doing a job which could
have been done in five.  But we had to be out there for ten hours for
it to be counted as a full day.  We worked in slow motion, and I stared
at the sun impatiently willing it to go down, and counted the minutes
until the whistle blew, signaling an end to work.  I soon discovered
that boredom was as exhausting as backbreaking labor.

Here, as in Ningnan, and much of Sichuan, there were no machines at
all.  Farming methods were more or less the same as 2,000 years ago,
except for some chemical fertilizers, which the team received from the
government in exchange for grain.  There were practically no work
animals except water buffaloes for plowing.  Everything else, including
the transport of water, manure, fuel, vegetables, and grain, was done
entirely by hand, and shoulders, using bamboo baskets or wooden barrels
on a shoulder pole.  My biggest problem was carrying loads.  My right
shoulder was perpetually swollen and sore from having to carry water
from the well to the house.  Whenever a young man who fancied me came
to visit I displayed such helplessness that he never failed to offer to
fill the water tank for me.  And not only the water tank jugs, bowls,
and even cups too.

The team leader considerately stopped assigning me to carry things, and
sent me to do 'light' jobs with the children and the older and pregnant
women.  But they were not always light to me.  Ladling out manure soon
made my arms sore, not to mention churning up my stomach when I saw the
fat maggots swimming on the surface.  Picking cotton in a sea of
brilliant whiteness might have made an idyllic picture, but I quickly
realized how demanding it was directly under the relentless sun, in
temperatures well over 85 F, with high humidity, among prickly branches
that left scratches all over me.

I preferred transplanting rice shoots.  This was considered a hard job
because one had to bend so much.

Often at the end of the day, even the toughest men complained about not
being able to stand up straight.  But I loved the cool water on my legs
in the otherwise unbearable heat, the sight of the neat rows of tender
green, and the soft mud under my bare feet, which gave me a sensuous
pleasure.  The only thing that really bothered me was the leeches.  My
first encounter was when I felt something

[ Work as a Peasant and a BareJ3of Doctor 555 ticklish on my leg.  I
lifted it to scratch and saw a fat, slithery creature bending its head
into my skin, busily trying to squeeze in.  I let out a mighty scream.
A peasant girl next to me giggled.  She found my squeamishness funny.
Nevertheless, she trudged over and slapped my leg just above the leech.
It fell into the water with a plop.

On winter mornings, in the two-hour work period before breakfast, I
climbed up the hills with the 'weaker' women to collect firewood. There
were scarcely any trees on the hills, and even the bushes were few and
far between.  We often had to walk a long way.  We cut with a sickle,
grabbing the plants with our free hand.  The shrubs were covered with
thorns, quite a few of which would always manage to embed themselves in
my left palm and wrist.  At first I spent a long time trying to pick
them out, but eventually I got used to leaving them to come out on
their own, after the spots became inflamed.

We gathered what the peasants called 'feather fuel."  This was pretty
useless, and burned up in no time.  Once I voiced my regret about the
lack of proper trees.  The women with me said it had not always been
like this.  Before the Great Leap Forward, they told me, the hills had
been covered with pine, eucalyptus, and cypress.  They had all been
felled to feed the 'backyard furnaces' to produce steel.  The women
told me this placidly, with no bitterness, as though it were not the
cause of their daily battle for fuel.  They seemed to treat it as
something which life had thrust on them, like many other misfortunes. I
was shocked to come face-to-face, for the first time, with the
disastrous consequences of the Great Leap, which I had known only as a
'glorious success."

I found out a lot of other things.  A 'speak-bitterness' session was
organized for the peasants to describe how they had suffered under the
Kuomintang, and to generate gratitude to Mao, particularly among the
younger generation.  Some peasants talked about childhoods of
unrelieved hunger, and lamented that their own children were so spoiled
that they often had to be coaxed to finish their food.

Then their conversation turned to a particular famine.

They described having to eat sweet potato leaves and digging into the
ridges between the fields in the hope of finding some roots.  They
mentioned the many deaths in the village.  Their stories reduced me to
tears.  After saying how they hated the Kuomintang and how they loved
Chairman Mao, the peasants referred to this famine as taking place at
'the time of forming the communes."  Suddenly it struck me that the
famine they were talking about was under the Communists.  They had
confused the two regimes.  I asked:

"Were there unprecedented natural calamities in this period?  Wasn't
that the cause of the problem?"

"Oh no," they said.

"The weather could not have been better and there was plenty of grain
in the fields.  But that man' they pointed to a cringing forty-year-old
'ordered the men away to make steel, and half the harvest was lost in
the fields.  But he told us: no matter, we were in the paradise of
Communism now and did not have to worry about food.

Before, we had always had to control our stomachs, but then we ate our
fill in the commune canteen; we threw away the leftovers; we even fed
the pigs with precious rice.

Then the canteen had no more food, but he placed guards outside the
store.  The rest of the grain was to be shipped to Peking and Shanghai
there were foreigners there."

Bit by bit, the full picture came out.  The cringing man had been the
leader of the production team during the Great Leap.  He and his
cronies had smashed the peasants' woks and stoves so they could not
cook at home, and so the woks could be fed into the furnaces.  He had
reported vastly exaggerated harvests, with the result that the taxes
were so high they took every morsel of grain the peasants had left. The
villagers had died in scores.  After the famine, he was blamed for all
the wrongs in the village.  The commune allowed the villagers to vote
him out of office, and labeled him a 'class enemy."

4~

I Work as a Peasant and a Barefoot Da;'or 557 Like most class enemies,
he was not put in prison but kept 'under surveillance' by his fellow
villagers.  This was Mao's way: to keep 'enemy' figures among the
people so they always had someone visible and at hand to hate. Whenever
a new campaign came along, this man would be one of the 'usual
suspects' to be rounded up and attacked atYesh.  He was always assigned
the hardest jobs, and was allocated only seven work points a day, three
fewer than most of the other men.  I never saw anyone talking to him.
Several times I spotted village children throwing stones at his sons.

The peasants thanked Chairman Mao for punishing him.  No one questioned
his guilt, or the degree of his responsibility.  I sought him out, on
my own, and asked him his story.

He seemed pathetically grateful to be asked.

"I was carrying out orders," he kept saying.

"I had to carry out orders .... Then he sighed: "Of course, I didn't
want to lose my post.  Somebody else would have taken my place.

Then what would have happened to me and my kids?  We probably would
have died of hunger.  A production team leader is small, but at least
he can die after everyone else in the village."

His words and the peasants' stories shook me to the core.  It was the
first time I had come across the ugly side of Communist China before
the Cultural Revolution.  The picture was vastly different from the
rosy official version.

In the hills and fields of Deyang my doubts about the Communist regime
deepened.

I have sometimes wondered whether Mao knew what he was doing putting
the sheltered urban youth of China in touch with reality.  But then he
was confident that much of the population would not be able to make
rational deductions with the fragmentary information available to
them.

Indeed, at the age of eighteen I was still only capable of vague
doubts, not explicit analysis of the regime.  No matter how much I
hated the Cultural Revolution, to doubt Mao still did not enter my
mind.

In Deyang, as in Ningnan, few peasants could read the simplest article
in a newspaper or write a rudimentary letter.  Many could not even
write their own name.  The Communists' early drive to tackle illiteracy
had been pushed aside by incessant witch-hunts.  There had once been an
elementary school in the village, subsidized by the commune, but at the
beginning of the Cultural Revolution the children abused the teacher to
their hearts' content.

They paraded him around the village with heavy cast-iron woks piled up
on his head and his face blackened with soot.  Once they almost
fractured his skull.  Since then, no one could be persuaded to teach.

Most peasants did not miss the school.

"What's the point?"  they would say.

"You pay fees and read for years, and in the end you are still a
peasant, earning your food with your sweat.  You don't get a grain of
rice more for being able to read books.  Why waste time and money?

Might as well start earning your work points right away."

The virtual absence of any chance of a better future and the near total
immobility for anyone born a peasant took the incentive out of the
pursuit of knowledge.  Children of school age would stay at home to
help their families with their work or look after younger brothers and
sisters.  They would be out in the fields when they were barely in
their teens.  As for girls, the peasants considered it a complete waste
of time for them to go to school.

"They get married and belong to other people.  It's like pouring water
on the ground."

The Cultural Revolution was trumpeted as having brought education to
the peasants through 'evening classes."  One day my production team
announced it was starting evening classes and asked Nana and me to be
the teachers.  I was delighted.  However, as soon as the first 'class'
began, I realized that this was no education.

The classes invariably started with Nana and me being asked by the
production team leader to read out articles by Mao or other items from
the People's Daily.  Then he would make an hour-long speech consisting
of all the latest political jargon strung together in undigested and
largcl~ unintelligible hunks.  Now and then he would give specihc
orders, all solemnly delivered in the name of Mao.

"Chairman Mao says we must eat two meals of rice porridge and only one
meal of solid rice a day."

"Chairman Mao says we mustn't waste sweet potatoes on pigs."

After a hard day's work in the fields, the peasants' minds were on
their household chores.  Their evenings were valuable to them, but no
one dared to skip the 'classes."  They just sat there, and eventually
dozed off.  I was not sorry, to see this form of 'education," designed
to stupe~ rather than enlighten, gradually wither away.

Without education, the peasants' world was painfully narrow.  Their
conversations usually centered on minute details of daily living.  One
woman would spend a whole morning complaining that her sister-in-law
had used ten bundles of feather fuel for cooking breakfast when she
could have made do with nine (fuel, like everything else, was pooled).
Another would grumble for hours that her mother-in-law put too many
sweet potatoes in the rice (rice being more precious and desirable than
sweet potatoes).

I knew their restricted horizon was not their fault, but nonetheless I
found their conversations unbearable.

One unfailing topic of gossip was, of course, sex.  A twenty-year-old
woman called Mei from the Deyang county town had been assigned to the
village next to mine.

She had allegedly slept with a lot of city youths as well as peasants,
and every now and then in the fields someone would come up with a lewd
story about her.  It was rumored that she was pregnant, and had been
binding her waist to hide it.  In an effort to prove that she was not
carrying a 'bastard," Mei deliberately did all the things a pregnant
woman was not supposed to do, like carrying heavy loads.

Eventually a dead baby was discovered in the bushes next to a stream in
her village.  People said it was hers.  Nobody knew whether it had been
born dead.  Her production team leader ordered a hole dug and buried
the baby.  And that was that, apart from the gossip, which became even
more virulent.

The whole story appalled me, but there were other shocks.  One of my
neighbors had four daughters four dark-skinned, round-eyed beauties.
But the villagers did not think they were pretty.  Too dark, they said.
Pale skin was the main criterion for beauty in much of the Chinese
countryside.  When it was time for the eldest daughter to get married,
the father decided to look for a son-in-law who would come and live in
their house.  That way, he would not only keep his daughter's work
points, but would also get an extra pair of hands.  Normally, women
married into men's families, and it was considered a great humiliation
for a man to marry into a woman's family.  But our neighbor eventually
found a young man from a very poor mountain area who was desperate to
get out and could never do so except through marriage.  The young man
thus had a very low status.  I often heard his father-in-law shouting
abuse at him at the top of his voice.  To torment the young man, he
made his daughter sleep alone when the whim took him.  She did not dare
to refuse because 'filial piety," which was deep-rooted in Confucian
ethics, enjoined that children must obey their parents and because she
must not be seen as being keen to sleep with a man, even her husband:
for a woman to enjoy sex was considered shameful.  I was awakened one
morning by a commotion outside my window.  The young man had somehow
got hold of a few bottles of alcohol made with sweet potatoes and had
poured them down his throat.  His father in-law had been kicking his
bedroom door to get him to start working.  When he finally broke the
door down, the son-in-law was dead.

One day my production team was making pea noodles, and borrowed my
enamel washbowl to carry water.  That day, the noodles collapsed into a
shapeless mess.  The crowd that had gathered excitedly and expectantly
around

I Work as a Peasant and a Bare~of Doctor the noodle-making barrel
started muttering loudly when they saw me approaching, and glared at me
with disgust.

I was scared.  Later I was told by some women that the villagers blamed
the sagging noodles on me.  They said I must have used the bowl to wash
when I was menstruating.

The women told me I was lucky to be a 'city youth."  If it had been one
of them, their menfolk would have given them 'a really good hiding."

On another occasion, a group of young men passing through our village
carrying baskets of sweet potatoes were taking a break on a narrow
road.  Their shoulder poles were lying on the ground, blocking the way.
I stepped over one of them.  All of a sudden, one of the young men
jumped to his feet, picked up his pole, and stood in front of me, with
fiery eyes.  He looked as though he was going to strike me.  From the
other peasants, I learned that he believed he would develop shoulder
sores if a woman stepped over his pole.  I was made to cross back over
it 'to undo the poison."

During the whole time I was in the countryside, I never saw any attempt
to tackle such warped thinking in fact, it was never even mentioned.

The most educated person in my production team was the former landlord.
I had been conditioned to regard landlords as evil, and now, to my
initial uneasiness, I found that I got on best with this family.  They
bore no resemblance to the stereotypes that had been drilled into my
mind.  The husband did not have cruel, vicious eyes, and his wife did
not wiggle her bottom, or make her voice sugary, to appear seductive.

Sometimes, when we were alone, he would talk about his grievances.

"ChangJung," he once said, "I know you are a kind person.  You must be
a reasonable person as well, since you have read books.  You can judge
whether this is fair."  Then he told me why he had been classified as a
landlord.  He had been a waiter in Chengdu in 1948, and had saved up
some money by watching every penny.  At the time, some farsighted
landlords were selling their land cheap, as they could see land reform
coming if the Communists reached Sichuan.  The waiter was not
politically astute, and bought some land, thinking he had got a
bargain.  He not only soon lost most of it in the land reform, but
became a class enemy to boot.

"Alas," he said, with resignation, quoting a classic line, 'one single
slip has caused a thousand years of sorrow."

The villagers seemed to feel no hostility toward the landlord and his
family, although they kept their distance.  But, like all 'class
enemies," they were always given the jobs no one else wanted.  And the
two sons got one work point less than other men, in spite of the fact
that they were the hardest-working men in the village.  They seemed to
me to be highly intelligent, and also the most refined young men
around.  Their gentleness and gracefulness set them apart, and I found
that I felt closer to them than to any other young people in the
village.  However, in spite of their qualities, no girls wanted to
marry them.  Their mother told me how much money she had spent buying
presents for the few gifts whom the go-betweens had introduced.  The
gifts would accept the clothes and money and then walk off.  Other
peasants could have demanded the presents back, but a landlord's family
could do nothing.  She would sigh long and loud about the fact that her
sons had little prospect of decent marriages.  But, she told me, they
bore their misfortune lightly: after each disappointment, they would
try to cheer her up.  They would offer to work on market days to earn
back the cost of her lost presents.

All these misfortunes were told to me without much drama or emotion.
Here it seemed that even shocking deaths were like a stone being
dropped into a pond where the splash and the ripple closed over into
stillness in no lime.

In the placidity of the village, in the hushed depth of the nights in
my damp home, I did a lot of reading and thinking.  When I first came
to Deyang, Jin-ming gave me several big cases of his black-market
books, which he had been
able to accumulate because the house raiders had now mostly been
packed off to the 'cadres' school' at Miyi, together with my father.
All day while I was out in the fields, I itched to get back to them.

I devoured what had survived the burning of my father's library.  There
were the complete works of Lu Xun, the great Chinese writer of the
192os and 193os.

Because he died in 1936, before the Communists came to power, he
escaped being persecuted by Mao, and even became a great hero of his
whereas Lu Xun's favorite pupil and closest associate, Hu Feng, was
personally named by Mao as a counterrevolutionary, and was imprisoned
for decades.  It was the persecution of Hu Feng that led to the
witch-hunt in which my mother was detained in 1955.

Lu Xun had been my father's great favorite.  When I was a child, he
often read us essays by Lu.  I had not understood them at the time,
even with my father's explanations, but now I was engrossed.  I found
that their satirical edge could be applied to the Communists as well as
to the Kuomintang.  Lu Xun had no ideology, only enlightened
humanitarianism.  His skeptical genius challenged all assumptions.

He was another whose free intelligence helped liberate me from my
indoctrination.

My father's collection of Marxist classics was also useful to me.  I
read randomly, following the obscure words with my finger, and
wondering what on earth those nineteenth century German controversies
had to do with Mao's China.  But I was attracted by something I had
rarely come across in China the logic that ran through an argument.

Reading Marx helped me to think rationally and analytically.

I enjoyed these new ways of organizing my thoughts.  At other times I
would let my mind slip into more nebulous moods and wrote poetry, in
classical styles.  While I was working in the fields I was often
absorbed in composing poems, which made working bearable, at times even
agree able.  Because of this, I preferred solitude, and positively
discouraged conversation.

One day I had been working all morning, cutting cane with a sickle and
eating the juiciest parts near the roots.

The cane went to the commune sugar factory, in exchange for sugar.  We
had to fill a quota in quantity, but not in quality, so we ate the best
parts.  When lunch break came, and someone had to stay in the field to
keep watch for thieves, I offered my services so I would have some time
alone.  I would go for my lunch when the peasants came back and so have
even more time to myself.

I lay on my back on a stack of canes, a straw hat par fly shading my
face.  Through the hat I could see the vast turquoise sky.  A leaf
protruded from the stack above my head, looking disproportionately
enormous against the sky.

I half-closed my eyes, feeling soothed by the cool greenness.

The leaf reminded me of the swaying leaves of a grove of bamboo on a
similar hot summer afternoon many years before.  Sitting in its shade
fishing, my father had written a forlorn poem.  In the same ge-lu
pattern of tones, rhymes, and types of words as his poem, I began to
compose one of my own.  The universe seemed to be standing still, apart
from the light rustle of the refreshing breeze in the cane leaves. Life
felt beautiful to me at that moment.

In this period, I snatched at the chance for solitude, and
ostentatiously showed that I wanted nothing to do with the world around
me, which must have made me seem rather arrogant.  And because the
peasants were the model I was meant to emulate, I reacted by
concentrating on their negative qualities.  I did not try to get to
know them, or to get on with them.

I was not very popular in the village, although the peasants largely
left me alone.  They disapproved of me for failing to work as hard as
they thought I should.  Work was their whole life, and the major
criterion by which they judged anyone.  Their eye for hard work was
both uncompromising and fair, and it was clear to them that I hated
physical labor and took every opportunity to stay at home and read my
books. The stomach trouble and skin rash I had suffered in Ningnan hit
me again as soon as I came to Deyang.  Virtually every day I had some
sort of diarrhea, and my legs broke out in infected sores.  I
constantly felt weak and dizzy, but it was no good complaining to the
peasants; their harsh life had made them regard all nonfatal illnesses
as trivial.

The thing that made me most unpopular, though, was that I was often
away.  I spent about two-thirds of the time that I should have been in
Deyang visiting my parents in their camps, or looking after Aunt
Jun-ying in Yibin.  Each trip lasted several months, and there was no
law forbidding it.  But although I did not work nearly enough to earn
my keep, I still took food from the village.  The peasants were stuck
with their egalitarian distribution system, and they were stuck with me
they could not throw me out.  Naturally, they blamed me, and I felt
sorry for them.  But I was stuck with them, too.  I could not get
out.

In spite of their resentment, my production team allowed me to come and
go as I liked, which was partly because I had kept my distance from
them.  I learned that the best way to get by was to be regarded as an
unobtrusively aloof outsider.  Once you became 'one of the masses," you
immediately let yourself in for intrusion and control.

Meanwhile, my sister Xiao-hong was doing well in the neighboring
village.  Although, like me, she was perpetually bitten by He as and
poisoned by manure so that her legs were sometimes so swollen she got
fever, she continued to work hard, and was awarded eight work points a
day.  Specs often came from Chengdu to help her.  His factory, like
most others, was at a virtual standstill.  The management had been
'smashed," and the new Revolutionary Committee was only concerned with
getting the workers to take part in the revolution rather than in
production, and most just came and went as they pleased.  Sometimes
Specs worked in the fields in my sister's place to give her a break.

At other times, he worked with her, which delighted the villagers, who
said: "This is a bargain.  We took in one young girl, but we've ended
up with two pairs of hands!"

Nana, my sister, and I used to go to the country market together on
market day, which was once a week.  I loved the boisterous alleys lined
with baskets and shoulder poles.

The peasants would walk for hours to sell a single chicken or a dozen
eggs, or a bundle of bamboo.  Most moneymaking activities, such as
growing cash crops, making baskets, or raising pigs for sale, were
banned for individual households, on the grounds that they were
'capitalist."  As a result, peasants had very little to exchange for
cash.  Without money, it was impossible for them to travel to cities,
and market day was almost their only source of entertainment.  They
would meet up with their relatives and friends, the men squatting on
the muddy pavements puffing on their pipes.

In spring 197o my sister and Specs were married.  There was no
ceremony.  In the atmosphere of the day, it did not cross their minds
to have one.  They just collected their marriage certificate from the
commune headquarters and then went back to my sister's village with
sweets and cigarettes with which to entertain the villagers.  The
peasants were thrilled: they could rarely afford these precious
treats.

For the peasants, a wedding was a big thing.  As soon as the news
broke, they crowded into my sister's thatched cottage to offer their
congratulations.  They brought presents like a handful of dried
noodles, a pound of soybeans, and a few eggs, wrapped carefully in red
straw paper and fled with straw in a fancy knot.  These were no
ordinary gifts.  The peasants had deprived themselves of valuable
items.  My sister and Specs were very touched.  When Nana and I went to
see the new couple, they were teaching the village children how to do
'loyalty dances' for fun.

Marriage did not get my sister out of the countryside,

I Work as a Peasant and a Bare~of Donor 567 as couples were not
automatically granted residence together.  Of course, if Specs had been
willing to relinquish his city registration, he could easily have set
fled with my sister, but she could not move to Chengdu with him because
she had a country registration.  Like tens of millions of couples in
China, they lived separately, entitled by regulation to twelve days a
year together.  Luckily for them, Specs's factory was not working
normally, so he could spend a lot of time in Deyang.

After a year in Deyang there was a change in my life: I entered the
medical profession.  The production brigade to which my team belonged
ran a clinic which dealt with simple illnesses.  It was funded by all
the production teams under the brigade, and treatment was free, but
very limited.

There were two doctors.  One of them, a young man with a fine,
intelligent face, had graduated from the medical school of Deyang
County in the fifties, and had come back to work in his native village.
The other was middle-aged with a goatee.  He had started out as an
apprentice to an old country doctor practicing Chinese medicine, and in
1964 he had been sent by the commune to attend a crash course in
Western medicine.

At the beginning of 197x, the commune authorities ordered the clinic to
take on a 'barefoot doctor."  The name came about because the 'doctor'
was supposed to live like the peasants, who treasured their shoes too
much to wear them in the muddy fields.  At the time, there was a big
propaganda campaign hailing barefoot doctors as an invention of the
Cultural Revolution.  My production team jumped at this opportunity to
get rid of me: if I worked in the clinic, the brigade, rather than my
team, would be responsible for my food and other income.

I had always wanted to be a doctor.  The illnesses in my family,
particularly the death of my grandmother, had driven home to me how
important doctors were.  Before I went to Deyang, I had started
learning acupuncture from a friend, and I had been studying a book
called A Barefoot

Doctor's Manual, one of the few printed items allowed in those days.

The propaganda about barefoot doctors was one of Mao's political
maneuvers.  He had condemned the pre Cultural Revolution Health
Ministry for not looking after peasants and concerning itself only with
city dwellers, especially Party officials.  He also condemned doctors
for not wanting to work in the countryside, particularly in the remote
areas.  But Mao took no responsibility as head of the regime, nor did
he order any practical steps to remedy the situation, such as giving
instructions to build more hospitals or train more proper doctors, and
during the Cultural Revolution the medical situation got worse.  The
propaganda line about peasants having no doctors was really intended to
generate hatred against the pre-Cultural Revolution Party system, and
against intellectuals (this category included doctors and nurses).

Mao offered a magic cure to the peasants: 'doctors' who could be turned
out en masse barefoot doctors.

"It is not at all necessary to have so much formal training," he
said.

"They should mainly learn and raise their standard in practice."  On
26June 1965 he made the remark which became a guideline for health and
education: "The more books you read, the more stupid you become."  I
went to work with absolutely no training.

The clinic was in a large hall on top of a hill about an hour's walk
from my cottage.  Next door was a shop selling matches, salt, and soy
sauce which were all rationed.  One of the surgery rooms became my
bedroom.  My professional duties were left vague.

The only medical book I had ever set eyes on was A Barefoot Doctor's
Manual.  I studied it avidly.  There was no theory in it, just a
summary of symptoms, followed by suggested prescriptions.  When I sat
at my desk, with the other two doctors behind me, all wearing our dusty
everyday clothes, it was clear that the sick peasants who came in very
sensibly wanted nothing to do with me, an inexperi

I Work as a Peasant and a BareJbot Doctor 569 enced eighteen-year-old
with some sort of book they could not read, and which was not even very
thick.  They went straight past me to the other two desks.  I felt more
relieved than offended.  It was not my idea of being a doctor to have
to consult a book every time patients described their symptoms, and
then to copy down the recommended prescription.  Sometimes, in an
ironic mood, I would contemplate whether our new leaders Chairman Mao
was still beyond questioning would want me as their personal doctor,
barefoot or not.  But then, I told myself, of course not: barefoot
doctors were supposed to 'serve the people, not the officials' in the
first place.  I settled happily for just being a nurse, doling out
medicines on prescription and giving injections, which I had learned to
give to my mother for her hemorrhage.

The young doctor who had been to medical school was the one everybody
wanted.  His prescriptions of Chinese herbs cured many ailments.  He
was very conscientious, too, visiting patients in their villages and
collecting and growing herbs in his spare time.  The other doctor, with
the goatee, terrified me with his medical nonchalance.  He would use
the same needle to inject several different patients without any
sterilization.  And he injected penicillin without testing whether the
person was allergic to it, which was extremely dangerous because
Chinese penicillin was not pure and could cause serious reactions, even
death.

Politely, I offered to do it for him.  He smiled, not offended by my
interference, and said there had never been any accidents: "The
peasants are not like delicate city folk."

I liked the doctors, and they were very kind to me, always helpful when
I asked questions.  Not surprisingly, they did not see me as a threat.
Out in the countryside, it was one's professional skills, rather than
political rhetoric, that counted.

I enjoyed living on that hilltop, far away from any village.

Every morning I got up early, strolled along the edge of the hill, and
to the rising sun recited lines from an ancient book of verse about
acupuncture.  Beneath my feet, the fields and cottages began to wake up
to the cocks' crowing.

A lonely Venus watched with a pale glow from a sky that was getting
brighter every minute.  I loved the fragrance of the honeysuckle in the
morning breeze, and the big petals of nightshade shaking off pearls of
dew.  Birds chirped all around, distracting me from my recitations.  I
would linger for a bit, and then walk back to light my stove for
breakfast.

With the help of an anatomical chart and my acupuncture verses, I had a
fairly clear idea where on the body I should stick my needles to cure
what.  I was eager for patients.  And I had some enthusiastic
volunteers boys from Chengdu who were now living in other villages and
who were keen on me.  They would walk for hours for an acupuncture
session.  One young man, rolling up his sleeve to expose an acupuncture
point near his elbow, declared with a brave face, "What are men friends
for?"

I did not fall in love with any of them, although my resolution to deny
myself a boyfriend in order to dedicate myself to my parents and
appease my guilt over my grandmother's death was weakening.  But I
found it difficult to let my heart go, and my upbringing prevented me
from having any physical relationship without surrendering my heart.
All around me, other boys and girls from the city were leading rather
freer lives.  But I sat, lonely, on a pedestal.  Word got out that I
wrote poetry, and that helped keep me there.

The young men all behaved most chivalrously.  One gave me a musical
instrument called a san-xian, made of a snakeskin bowl with a long
handle and three silk strings, which were plucked, and spent days
teaching me how to play it.  The permitted tunes were all in praise of
Mao, and were very limited.  But that did not make much difference to
me: my ability was even more limited.

In the warm evenings, I sat by the fragrant medicinal garden encircled
by Chinese trumpet creepers, and thrummed to myself.  Once the shop
next door closed for the night, I was
entirely alone.  It was dark except for the gently shining moon and the
twinkling of lights from distant cottages.  Sometimes fireflies glowed
and floated by like torches carried by tiny, invisible flying men.  The
scents from the garden made me dizzy with pleasure.  My music hardly
matched the enthusiastic chorus of the thundering frogs and the wistful
croon of the crickets.  But I found solace in it.

24.  "Please Accept My Apologies That Come a Lifetime Too Late'-My

Three days' truck journey from Chengdu, in northern Xichang, is Buffalo
Boy Flatland.  There the road forks, one branch heading southwest to
Miyi, where my father's camp was, the other southeast to Ningnan.

A famous legend gave the Flatland its name.  The Goddess Weaver,
daughter of the Celestial Queen Mother, used to descend from the
Celestial Court to bathe in a lake there.  (The meteor which fell on
Meteorite Street is supposed to have been a stone that propped up her
loom.) A boy living by the lake who looks after buffaloes sees the
goddess, and they fall in love.  They marry, and have a son and a
daughter.  The Celestial Queen Mother is jealous of their happiness,
and sends some gods down to kidnap the goddess.  They carry her off,
and the buffalo boy rushes after them.  Just as he is about to catch
them, the Celestial Queen Mother pulls a hairpin from her coil and
draws a huge river between them.  The Silver River separates the couple
permanently, except on the seventh day of the seventh moon, when
magpies fly from all over China to form a bridge for the family to
meet.

The Silver River is the Chinese name for the Milky Way.  Over Xichang
it looks vast, with a mass of stars, the bright Vega, the Goddess
Weaver, on one side, and Altair, the Buffalo Boy, with his two
children, on the other.  This legend has appealed to the Chinese for
centuries because their families have often been broken up by wars,
bandits, poverty, and heartless governments.  Ironically, it was to
this place that my mother was sent.

She arrived there in November 1969, with her 500 former colleagues from
the Eastern District Rebels as well as capitalist-roaders.  Because
they had been ordered out of Chengdu in a hurry there was nowhere for
them to live, except for a few shacks left by army engineers who had
been building a railway from Chengdu to Kunming, the capital of Yunnan.
Some squeezed into these.

Others had to cram their bedrolls into the houses of local peasants.

There were no building materials except cogon grass and mud, which had
to be dug out and carried down from the mountains.  The mud for the
walls was mixed with water and made into bricks.  There were no
machines, no electricity, not even any work animals.  On the Flatland,
which is about 5,000 feet above sea level, it is the day, rather than
the year, that is divided into four seasons.  At seven in the morning,
when my mother started working, the temperature was around freezing. By
midday, it could reach the high 8os.  At about 4 p.m. hot winds swirled
through the mountains and literally swept people off their feet.  At
seven in the evening, when they finished work, the temperature
plummeted again.  In these harsh extremes my mother and the other
inmates worked twelve hours a day, breaking only for a brief lunch. 
For the first few months, all they had to eat was rice and boiled
cabbage.

The camp was organized like an army, run by army officers, and came
under the control of the Chengdu Revolutionary Committee.  At first my
mother was treated as a class enemy and was forced to stand for the
whole of every lunch break with her head bowed.  This form of
punishment, called field side denunciation," was recommended by the
media as a way to remind the others, who were able to rest, that they
should save some energy for hatred.  My mother protested to her company
commander that she could not work all day without resting her legs. The
officer had been in the Military Department of the Eastern District
before the Cultural Revolution, and had got on well with her; he put a
stop to the practice.  Still, my mother was given the hardest jobs, and
she did not have Sundays off, unlike the other inmates.  The bleeding
from her womb worsened.  Then she was struck down with hepatitis.  Her
whole body was yellow and swollen, and she could hardly stand up.

One thing the camp did have was doctors, as half the hospital staff in
the Eastern District had been packed off there.  Only those who were
most in demand by the bosses of the Revolutionary Committees remained
in Chengdu.

The doctor who treated my mother told her how grateful he and the other
hospital staff were to her for protecting them before the Cultural
Revolution, and said that had it not been for her he would probably
have been labeled a rightist back in 1957.  There was no Western
medicine available, so he went miles to gather herbs like Asiatic
plantain and sun plants which the Chinese consider good for
hepatitis.

He also exaggerated the infectiousness of her illness to the camp
authorities, who then moved her to a place entirely on her own, half a
mile away.  Her tormentors left her alone, for fear of infection, but
the doctor came to see her every day, and secretly ordered a daily
supply of goat's milk from a local peasant.  My mother's new residence
was a deserted pigsty.  Sympathetic inmates cleaned it for her and put
a thick layer of hay on the ground.  It felt to her like a luxurious
mattress.  A friendly cook volunteered to deliver meals.  When no one
was looking, she would include

,?

3/I), Parents in Camps 575 a couple of eggs.  When meat became
available, my mother had it every day, while the others got it only
once a week.

She also had fresh fruit pears and peaches provided by friends who
bought them at markets.  As far as she was concerned, her hepatitis was
a godsend.

After about forty days, much to her regret, she recovered and was moved
back into the camp, now housed in new mud huts.  The Flatland is an odd
place in that it attracts lightning and thunder but not rain, which
falls on the surrounding mountains.  The local peasants did not plant
crops on the plains, because the soil was too dry and it was dangerous
during the frequent dry thunderstorms.  But this land was the only
resource available to the camp, so they planted a special strain of
drought-resistant corn and carried water from the lower slopes of the
mountains.  In order to get a future supply of rice, they offered to
help the local peasants harvest theirs.

The peasants agreed, but it was the local custom that women were
forbidden to carry water and men were barred from planting rice, which
could only be done by married women with children, particularly sons.
The more sons a woman had, the more she was in demand for this
backbreaking job.  The belief was that a woman who had produced a lot
of sons would produce more grains in the rice she planted ('sons' and
'seeds' have the same sound, zi, in Chinese).  My mother was the prime
'beneficiary' of this ancient custom.  As she had three sons, more than
most of her women colleagues, she had to spend up to fifteen hours a
day bent double in the paddy fields, with an inflamed lower abdomen,
and bleeding.

At night, she joined everyone else in taking turns to guard the pigs
from wolves.  The mud-and-grass shacks backed on to a range of
mountains aptly called "Wolves' Lair."  The wolves were very clever,
the locals told the new arrivals.  When one got into a pigsty, it would
gently scratch and lick a pig, particularly behind its ears, to get the
animal into a kind of pleasurable trance, so it would not make a noise.
Then the wolf would lightly bite the pig on one ear and lead it out of
the sty, all the time rubbing its body with its fluffy tail.  The pig
would still be dreaming of being caressed by a lover when the wolf
pounced.

The peasants told the city folk that the wolves and occasional leopards
were afraid of fires.  So every night a fire was lit outside the
pigsty.  My mother spent many sleepless nights watching meteors
shooting across the starlit vault of the sky, with the silhouette of
the Wolves' Lair against it, listening to the distant howling of the
wolves.

One evening she was washing her clothes in a small pond.  When she
straightened up from her squatting position she found she was staring
straight into the red eyes of a wolf standing about twenty yards away
across the pond.

Her hair stood on end, but she remembered that her childhood friend Big
Old Lee had told her that the way to deal with a wolf was to walk
backwards, slowly, never showing any sign of panic, and not to turn and
run.  So she backed away from the pond and walked as calmly as she
could toward the camp, all the time facing the wolf, who followed her.
When she reached the edge of the camp, the wolf stopped.  The fire was
in sight, and voices could be heard.

She swung around and raced into a doorway.

The fire was almost the only light in the depth of the nights in
Xichang.  There was no electricity.  Candles, when available at all,
were prohibitively expensive, and there was very little kerosene.  But
there was not much to read anyway.  Unlike Deyang, where I had relative
freedom to read Jin-ming's black-market books, a cadres' school was
lightly controlled.  The only printed materials allowed were the
selected works of Mao and the People's DaiS.  Occasionally, a new film
was shown in an army barracks a few miles away: it was invariably one
of Mine Mao's model operas.

As the days, then months went by, the harsh work and lack of relaxation
became unbearable.  Everyone missed their families and children, the
Rebels included.  Their resentment was perhaps more intense because
they now felt that all their past zealotry had turned out to be for
nothing, and that whatever they did, they would never get back to power
in Chengdu.  The Revolutionary Committees had been filled in their
absence.  Within months of reaching the Flatland, depression replaced
denunciations, and the Rebels sometimes had to be cheered up by my
mother.  She was given the nickname "Kuanyin' the goddess of
kindness.

At night, lying on her straw mattress, she thought back over her
children's early years.  She realized that there was not an awful lot
of family life to remember.  She had been an absentee mother when we
were growing up, having submitted herself to the cause at the cost of
her family.

Now she reflected with remorse on the pointlessness of her devotion.
She found she missed her children with a pain which was almost
unendurable.

Ten days before Chinese New Year, in February 197o, after over three
months on the Flatland, my mother's company was lined up in front of
their camp to welcome an army commander who was coming for an
inspection.  After waiting for a long time, the crowd spotted a small
figure approaching along the dirt track which climbed up from the
distant road.  They all stared at the moving figure, and decided it
could not be the big shot: he would be in a car with an entourage.  But
it could not be a local peasant, either: the way the long black wool
scarf was wrapped around the bent head was too stylish.  It was a young
woman with a large basket on her back.  Watching her slowly coming
nearer and nearer, my mother's heart started pounding.  She felt it
looked like me, and then she thought she might be imagining it.

"How wonderful it would be if it was Er-hong!"  she said to herself.
Suddenly, people were nudging her excitedly: "It's your daughter!  Your
daughter's here to see you!  Er-hong's here!"

This was my mother's account of how she saw me coming after what seemed
to her a lifetime.  I was the first visitor to the camp, and was
received with a mixture of warmth and envy.  I had come on the same
truck which had taken me to Ningnan to get my registration moved in
June the year before.  The big basket on my back was full of sausages,
eggs, sweets, cakes, noodles, sugar, and finned meats.  All five of us
children and Specs had pooled things from our rations, or our shares
from our production teams, to give our parents a treat.  I was
practically dragged down by the weight.

Two things immediately struck me.  My mother looked well she was just
over her convalescence from hepatitis, as she told me later.  And the
atmosphere around her was not hostile.  In fact, some people were
already calling her "Kuanyin," which was absolutely incredible to me
since she was officially a class enemy.

A dark-blue scarf covered her hair and was knotted under her chin.  Her
cheeks were no longer fine and delicate.  They had turned rough and
deep red under the fierce sun and harsh wind, and her skin looked very
much like that of a Xichang peasant.  She appeared at least ten years
older than her thirty-eight years.  When she stroked my face, her hands
felt like cracked old tree bark.

I stayed ten days, and was to depart for my father's camp on New Year's
Day.  My nice truck driver was to pick me up where he had dropped me
off.  My mother's eyes moistened because, although his camp was not far
away, she and my father were forbidden to visit each other.  I put the
food basket on my back untouched my mother insisted I take the whole
lot to my father.  Saving precious food for others has always been a
major way of expressing love and concern in China.  My mother was very
sad that I was going, and kept saying she was sorry I had to miss the
traditional Chinese New Year breakfast which her camp was going to
serve: tang-yuan, round dumplings, symbolizing family union.  But I
could not wait for it for fear of missing the truck.

My mother walked half an hour with me to the roadside and we sat down
in the high grass to wait.  The sweep of the landscape undulated with
the gentle waves of the thick cogon grass.  The sun was already bright
and warm.  M?

mother hugged me, her whole body seeming to say that she did not want
to let me go, that she was afraid she would never see me again.  At the
time, we did not know whether her camp and my commune would ever come
to an end.

We had been told we would be there for life.  There were hundreds of
reasons why we might die before we saw each other again.  My mother's
sadness infected me, and I thought of my grandmother dying before I was
able to get back from Ningnan.

The sun rose higher and higher.  There was no trace of my truck.  As
the large rings of smoke that had been pouring out of the chimney of
her camp in the distance thinned down, my mother was seized by regret
that she had not been able to give me the New Year's breakfast.  She
insisted on going back to get some for me.

While she was away the truck came.  I looked toward the camp and saw
her running toward me, the white-golden grass surging around her blue
scarf.  In her right hand she carried a big colorful enamel bowl.  She
was running with the kind of carefulness that told me she did not want
the soup with the dumplings to spill.  She was still a good way off,
and I could see she would not reach me for another twenty minutes or
so.  I did not feel I could ask the driver to wait that long, as he was
already doing me a big favor.

I clambered onto the back of the truck.  I could see my mother still
running toward me in the distance.  But she no longer seemed to be
carrying the bowl.

Years later, she told me the bowl had fallen from her hand when she saw
me climbing onto the truck.  But she still ran to the spot where we had
been sitting, just to make sure I had really gone, although it could
not have been anyone else getting onto the truck.  There was not a
single person around in that vast yellow ness  For the next few days
she walked around the camp as though in a trance, feeling blank and
lost.

58o "Please Accept My Apologies..."

After many hours of being bounced around on the back of the truck, I
arrived at my father's camp.  It was deep in the mountains, and had
been a forced labor camp a gulag.  The prisoners had hacked a farm out
of the wild mountains and had since been moved on to open up more harsh
virgin land, leaving this relatively cultivated site for those one rung
better off on China's punishment ladder, the deported officials.  The
camp was huge: it held thousands of former employees of the provincial
government.

I had to walk for a couple of hours from the road to reach my father's
'company."  A rope suspension bridge wobbled over a deep chasm as I
stepped onto it, almost making me lose my balance.  Exhausted as I was,
with the load on my back, I still managed to be amazed by the stunning
beauty of the mountains.  Although it was only early spring, bright
flowers were everywhere, next to kapok trees and bushes of papayas.
When I finally got to my father's dormitory, I saw a couple of colorful
pheasants swaggering majestically under a glade of early pear, plum,
and almond blossoms.  Weeks later, the fallen petals, pink and white,
were to bury the mud path.

My first sight of my father after over a year was harrowing.  He was
trotting into the courtyard carrying two baskets full of bricks on a
shoulder pole.  His old blue jacket hung loose on him, and his
rolled-up trouser legs revealed a pair of very thin legs with prominent
sinews.  His sun-beaten face was wrinkled, and his hair was almost
gray.  Then he saw me.  He put down his load with a fumbling movement,
the result of over excitement as I rushed over to him.

Because the Chinese tradition permitted little physical contact between
fathers and daughters, he told me how happy he was through his eyes.
They were so full of love and tenderness.  In them I also saw traces of
the ordeal he had been going through.  His youthful energy and spark
had given way to an air of aged confusion with a hint of quiet
determination.  Yet he was still in his prime, only forty-eight years
old.  A lump rose in my throat.  I searched his eyes

My Parents in Camps 58 I for signs of my worst fear, the return of his
insanit)'.  But he looked all right.  A heavy load lifted from my
heart.

He was sharing a room with seven other people, all from his department.
There was only one tiny window, so the door had to be left open all day
to let in some light.  The people in the room seldom spoke to each
other, and no one greeted me at all.  I felt immediately that the
atmosphere was much more severe than in my mother's camp.

The reason was that this camp was under the direct control of the
Sichuan Revolutionary Committee, and therefore of the Tings.  On the
walls of the courtyard there were still layers of posters and slogans
reading "Down with Soand-so' or "Eliminate So-and-so," against which
were propped scarred hoes and spades.  As I soon discovered, my father
was still being subjected to frequent denunciation meetings in the
evenings after a hard day's work.  Since one way to get out of the camp
was to be invited back to work for the Revolutionary Committee, and the
way to do that was to please the Tings, some Rebels competed with each
other to demonstrate their militancy, and my father was their natural
victim.

He was not allowed into the kitchen.  As an 'anti-Mao criminal," he was
alleged to be so dangerous he might poison the food.  It did not matter
whether anyone believed this.  The point was in the insult.

My father bore this and other cruelties with fortitude.

Only once did he allow his anger to show.  When he first came to the
camp, he was ordered to wear a white arm band with black characters
saying 'counterrevolutionary element in action."  He pushed away the
arm band violently and said from between clenched teeth, "Come on and
beat me to death.  I will not wear this!"  The Rebels backed away. They
knew he meant it and they had no order from above to kill him.

Here in the camp, the Tings were able to revenge themselves on their
enemies.  Among them was a man who had been involved in the
investigation into them in 1965.  He
had worked in the underground before 1949, and had been imprisoned and
tortured by the Kuomintang, which had destroyed his health.  In the
camp he soon fell gravely ill, but he had to go on working, and was not
allowed a single day off.  Because he was slow, he was ordered to make
it up in the evenings.  Wall posters denounced him for his laziness.
One of the posters I saw opened with the words:

"Have you, Comrade, noticed this grotesque living skeleton with hideous
facial features?"  Under Xichang's relentless sun, his skin had become
scorched and withered, and was peeling off in great chunks.  Also, he
was starved out of human shape: he had had two-thirds of his stomach
cut out, and could digest only a small amount of food at a time.

Because he could not have frequent meals, as he needed to, he was
permanently starving.  One day, in desperation, he went into the
kitchen to look for some pickle juice.  He was accused of trying to
poison the food.  Knowing he was on the verge of total collapse, he
wrote to the camp authorities saying that he was dying and requesting
to be spared some heavy jobs.  The only answer was a venomous poster
campaign.  Soon afterward he fainted in a field under the blazing sun,
as he was spreading manure.  He was taken to the camp hospital and died
the next day.  He had no family at his deathbed.  His wife had
committed suicide.

The capitalist-roaders were not the only ones who suffered in the
cadres' school.  People who had had any connection, however remote,
with the Kuomintang, anyone who had by some misfortune become the
target of some personal revenge, or the object of jealousy even leaders
of the unsuccessful Rebel factions had been dying in the camp in
scores.  Many had thrown themselves into the roaring river that sliced
through the valley.  The river was called "Tranquillity' (An-ning-he).
In the dead of night, its echoes spread many miles, and sent chills up
the spines of the inmates, who said it sounded like the sobbing of
ghosts.

Hearing about these suicides increased my determination to help relieve
the mental and physical pressure on my father as a matter of urgency. 
I had to make him feel lift.  was worth living, and that he was loved. 
At his denunciation meetings, which were now largely nonviolent, as the
inmates had run out of steam, I would sit where he could see me, so
that he could feel reassured by my being with him.  As soon as the
meeting was over, we would go off together on our own.  I would tell
him cheerful things to make him forget the ugliness of the meeting, and
massage his head, neck, and shoulders.  And he would recite classical
poems for me.  During the day, I helped him with his jobs, which,
naturally, were the hardest and dirtiest.  Sometimes I would carry his
loads, which weighed over a hundred pounds.  I managed to show him a
nonchalant face, although I could hardly stand under the weight.

I stayed over three months.  The authorities allowed me to eat in the
canteen, and gave me a bed in a room with five other women, who only
spoke to me briefly and coldly, if at all.  Most of the inmates
immediately assumed an air of hostility whenever they saw me.  I just
looked through them.  But there were kind people as well, or people who
were more courageous than others in showing their kindness.

One was a man in his late twenties with a sensitive face and big ears.
His name was Young, and he was a university graduate who had come to
work in my father's par anent just before the Cultural Revolution.  He
was the 'commander' of the 'squad' to which my father belonged.

Although he was obliged to assign the hardest jobs to my father,
whenever he could he would unobtrusively reduce his workload.  In one
of my fleeting conversations with him, I told him that I could not cook
the food I had brought with me, as there was no kerosene for my small
stove.

A couple of days later, Young sauntered past me with a blank expression
on his face.  I felt something metal thrust into my hand: it was a wire
burner about eight inches high and four inches in diameter, which he
had made himself.

It burned paper balls made out of old newspapers they could be torn up
now because Mao's portrait had disappeared from the pages.  (Mao
himself had stopped the practice, as he considered that its purpose 'to
greatly and especially establish' his 'absolute supreme authority' had
been achieved, and to go on with it would only result in overkill.) On
the burner's blue-and-orange flames I produced food that was far
superior to the camp fare.  When the delicious steam seeped through the
saucepan, I could see the jaws of my father's seven roommates
involuntarily masfcatng.  I regretted that I could not offer any of it
to Young: we would both be in trouble if his militant colleagues got
wind of it.

It was thanks to Young and other decent people like him that my father
was allowed to have visits from his children.

It was also Young who gave my father permission to leave the camp
premises on rainy days, which were his only days off, since, unlike
other inmates, he had to work on Sundays, just like my mother.  As soon
as it stopped raining, my father and I would go into the forests and
collect wild mushrooms under the pine trees, or search for wild peas,
which I would cook with a fin of duck or some other meat back in the
camp.  We would enjoy a heavenly meal.

After supper we often strolled to my favorite spot, which I called my
'zoological garden' - a group of fantastically shaped rocks in a grassy
clearing in the woods.  They looked like a herd of bizarre animals
lazing in the sun.

Some of them had hollows that fitted our bodies, and we would lie back
and gaze into the distance.  Down the slope from us was a row of
gigantic kapok trees, their leafless scarlet flowers, bigger versions
of magnolia, growing directly from the stark black branches, which all
grew uncompromisingly straight up.  During my months in the camp, I had
watched these giant flowers open, a mass of crimson against black. Then
they bore fruit as big as figs, and each burst into silky wool, which
was blown all over the mountains like feathery snow by the warm
winds.

Beyond the kapok trees lay the River of Tranquillity, and beyond it
stretched endless mountains.

One day when we were relaxing in our 'zoological garden," a peasant
passed by who was so gnarled and dwarfish he gave me a fright.  My
father told me that in this isolated region inbreeding was common. Then
he said, "There is so much to be done in these mountains!  It is such a
beautiful place with great potential.  I'd love to come and live here
to look after a commune, or maybe a production brigade, and do some
real work.  Something useful.

Or maybe just be an ordinary peasant.  I am so fed up with being an
official.  How nice it would be if our family could come here and enjoy
the simple life of the farmers."  In his eyes, I saw the frustration of
an energetic, talented man who was desperate to work.  I also
recognized the traditional idyllic dream of the Chinese scholar
disillusioned with his mandarin career.  Above all, I could see that an
alternative life had become a fantasy for my father, something
wonderful and unobtainable, because there was no opting out once you
were a Communist official.

I visited the camp three times, staying each time for several months.
My siblings did the same, so that my father would have warmth around
him all the time.  He often said proudly that he was the envy of the
camp because no one else had so much company from their children.
Indeed, few had any visitors at all: the Cultural Revolution had
brutalized human relationships, and alienated countless families.

My family became closer as time went by.  My brother Xiao-her, who had
been beaten by my father when he was a child, now came to love him.  On
his first visit to the camp, he and my father had to sleep on a single
bed because the camp leaders were jealous that my father had so much
family company.  In order to let my father have a good night's sleep
which was particularly important for his mental condition Xiao-her
would never allow himself to fall into a deep sleep lest he stretch out
and disturb him.

For his part, my father reproached himself for having been harsh to
Xiao-her, and would stroke his head and apologize.

"It seems inconceivable I could have hit you so hard.  I was too tough
on you," he would say.

"I've been thinking a lot about the past, and I feel very guilty toward
you.  Funny the Cultural Revolution should turn me into a better
person."

The camp fare was mainly boiled cabbage, and the lack of protein made
people feel hungry all the time.  Every meat-eating day was eagerly
anticipated, and celebrated with an air almost of exhilaration.  Even
the most militant Rebels seemed to be in a better humor.  On these
occasions, my father would pick the meat from his bowl and force it
into his children's.  There would always be a kind of fight with
chopsticks and bowls.

My father was in a constant state of remorse.  He told me how he had
not invited my grandmother to his wedding, and had sent her on the
perilous journey back to Manchuria from Yibin only a month after she
had arrived.  I heard him reproach himself many times for not showing
his own mother enough affection, and for being so rigid that he was not
even told about her funeral.  He would shake his head: "It's too late
now!"  He also blamed himself for his treatment of his sister Jun-ying
in the 1950S, when he had tried to persuade her to give up her Buddhist
beliefs, and even to get her, a vegetarian by conviction, to eat
meat.

Aunt Jun-ying died in the summer of 1970.  Her paralysis had gradually
invaded her whole body, and she had received no proper treatment.  She
died in the same state of quiet composure as she had shown all her
life.  My family kept the news from my father.  We all knew how deeply
he loved and respected her.

That autumn my brothers Xiao-her and Xiao-fang were staying with my
father.  One day they were having a walk after supper, when
eight-year-old Xiao-fang let slip the news that Aunt Jun-ying had died.
Suddenly, my father's face changed.  He stood still, looking blank for
a long time, then turned to the side of the path, sagged onto his
haunches, and covered his face with both hands.  His shoulders shook
with sobs.  Never having seen my father cry, my brothers were
dumbfounded.

At the beginning of 197x news filtered through that the Tings had been
sacked.  For my parents, particularly my father, there was some
improvement in their lives.  They began to have Sundays off and lighter
jobs.  The other detainees started to speak to my father, though still
coldly.

Proof that things really were changing came when a new inmate arrived
at the camp early in 1971 Mrs.  Shau, my father's old tormentor, who
had fallen from grace together with the Tings.  Then my mother was
allowed to spend two weeks with my father the first chance for them to
be together for several years, in fact the first time they had even
glimpsed each other since the winter morning on the street in Chengdu
just before my father's departure for the camp, over two years
before.

But my parents' misery was far from over.  The Cultural Revolution
continued.  The Tings had not been purged because of all the evil they
had done, but because they were suspected by Mao of being closely
linked to Chen Boda, one of the leaders of the Cultural Revolution
Authority, who had fallen foul of Mao.  In this purge, more victims
were generated.  Chen Mo, the Tings' right-hand man, who had helped
secure my father's release from prison, committed suicide.

One day in the summer of 1971 my mother had a severe hemorrhage from
her womb; she passed out and had to be taken to a hospital.  My father
was not permitted to visit her, although they were both in Xichang.
When her condition stabilized, she was allowed to go back to Chengdu
for treatment.  There, the bleeding was finally stopped; but the
doctors discovered that she had developed a skin disease called
scleroderma.  A patch of skin behind her right ear had turned hard and
had begun to contract.  The right side of her jaw had become
considerably smaller than the left, and the hearing in her right ear
was going.  The right side of her neck was stiff, and her right hand
and arm felt rigid and numb.  Dermatologists told her the hardening of
the skin could eventually spread to the internal organs and, if so, she
would shrink and die in three or four years.  They said there was
nothing Western medicine could do.  All they could suggest was corf
sone which my mother took in the form of tablets and injections in her
neck.

I was in the camp with my father when a letter came from Mother with
the news.  Immediately my father went to ask for permission to go home
and see her.  Young was very sympathetic, but the camp authorities
refused.  My father burst out crying in front of a whole courtyard of
inmates.  The people from his department were taken aback.  They knew
him as a 'man of iron."  Early the next morning, he went to the post
office and waited outside for hours until it opened.  He sent a
three-page telegram to my mother.  It began: "Please accept my
apologies that come a lifetime too late.  It is for my guilt toward you
that I am happy for any punishment.  I have not been a decent husband.
Please get well and give me another chance."

On z5 October 197i, Specs came to see me in Deyang with a dynamite
piece of news: Lin Biao had been killed.

Specs had been officially told in his factory that Lin had attempted to
assassinate Mao and that, having failed, he had tried to flee to the
Soviet Union, and his plane had crashed in Mongolia.

Lin Biao's death was shrouded in mystery.  It was linked with the
downfall of Chen Boda a year before.  Mao grew suspicious of both of
them when they went too far with their over-the-top deification of him,
which he suspected was part of a scheme to kick him upstairs to
abstract glory and deprive him of earthly power.  Mao particularly
smelled a rat with Lin Biao, his chosen successor, who was known i l
for 'never letting the Little Red Book leave his hand, nor "Long live
Mao!"  leave his lips," as a later rhyme put it.

Mao decided that Lin, being next in line to the throne, was up to no
good.  Either Mao or Lin, or both, took action to save their own power
and life.

My village was given the official version of events by the commune soon
afterward.  The news meant nothing to the peasants.  They hardly even
knew Lin's name, but I received the news with blinding joy.  Not having
been able to challenge Mao in my mind, I blamed Lin for the Cultural
Revolution.  The evident rift between him and Mao meant, I thought,
that Mao had repudiated the Cultural Revolution, and would put an end
to all the misery, and destruction.  The demise of Lin in a way
reaffirmed my faith in Mao.  Many people shared my optimism because
there were signs that the Cultural Revolution was going to be reversed.
Almost immediately some capitalist-roaders started to be rehabilitated
and released from the camps.

My father was told the news about Lin in mid November  At once, the
occasional smile appeared on the faces of some Rebels.  At the
meetings, he was asked to sit down, which was unprecedented, and
'expose Yeh Chun' - Mme Lin Biao, who had been a colleague of his in
Yan'an in the early 194os.  My father said nothing.

But although his colleagues were being rehabilitated, and leaving the
camp in droves, my father was told by the camp commandant: "Don't you
assume you can get off the hook now."  His offense against Mao was
considered too serious.

His health had been deteriorating under the combination of intolerable
mental and physical pressure, with years of brutal beatings followed by
hard physical labor under atrocious conditions.  For nearly five years
he had been taking large doses of tranquilizers in order to keep
himself under control.  Sometimes he consumed up to twenty times the
normal dose, and this had worn out his system.  He felt crippling pains
somewhere in his body all the time; he began to cough blood, and was
frequently short of breath, accompanied by severe dizzy spells.  At the
age of fifty, he looked like a seventy-year-old.  The doctors in the
camp always greeted him with cold faces and impatient prescriptions of
more tranquilizers; they refused to give him a checkup, or even to hear
him out.  And each trip to the clinic would be followed by a barked
lecture from some of the Rebels: "Don't imagine you can get away with
faking illness!"

Jin-ming was in the camp at the end of 197 x. He was so worried about
Father that he stayed ore until the spring of 1972.  Then he got a
letter from his production team ordering him to return immediately, or
he would not be allocated any food at harvest time.  The day he was
leaving, my father went with him to the train a railway line had just
come to Miyi because of the strategic industries relocated to Xichang.
During the long walk, they were both silent.  Then Father had a sudden
attack of breathlessness and Jin-ming had to help him sit down by the
side of the road.  For a long time Father struggled to catch his
breath.

Then Jin-ming heard him sigh deeply and say, "It looks as though I
probably don't have long to live.  Life seems to be a dream."  Jin-ming
had never heard him talk about death.

Startled, he tried to comfort him.  But Father said slowly, "I ask
myself whether I am afraid of death.  I don't think I am.  My life as
it is now is worse.  And it looks as if there is not going to be any
ending.  Sometimes I feel weak: I stand by Tranquillity River and
think, Just one leap and I can get it over with.  Then I tell myself I
must not.  If I die without being cleared, there will be no end of
trouble for all of you .... I have been thinking a lot lately.  I had a
hard childhood, and society was full of injustice.  It was for a fair
society that I joined the Communists.  I've tried my best through the
years.  But what good has it done for the people?  As for myself, why
is it that in the end I have come to be the ruin of my family?  People
who believe in retribution say that to end badly you must have
something

My Parents in Camps 59 l on your conscience.  I have been thinking hard
about the things I've done in my life.  I have given orders to execute
some people..."

Father went on to tell Jin-ming about the death sentences he had
signed, the names and stories of the e-ba ('ferocious despots') in the
land reform in Chaoyang, and the bandit chiefs in Yibin.

"But these people had done so much evil that God himself would have had
them killed.

What, then, have I done wrong to deserve all this?"

After a long pause, Father said, "If I die like this, don't believe in
the Communist Party anymore."

25.  "The Fragrance of

Sweet Wind'~ A New Life with The Electricians' Manual and Six Crises
(197~- 1975)

It was with deaths, love, torment, and respite that 1969, 197O, and
197i passed.  In Miyi, the dry and rainy seasons followed hard on each
other's heels.  On Buffalo Boy Flatland the moon waxed and waned, the
wind roared and hushed, the wolves howled and fell silent.  In the
medicinal garden in Deyang, the herbs flowered once, and then again and
again.  I rushed between my parents' camps, my aunt's deathbed, and my
village.  I spread manure in the paddy fields and composed poems to
water lilies.

My mother was at home in Chengdu when she heard of Lin Biao's demise.
She was rehabilitated in November 1971 and told that she did not have
to return to her camp.

But although she received her full salary, she was not given back her
old job, which had been filled by someone else.

Her department in the Eastern District now had no fewer than seven
directors the existing members of the Revolutionary Committees and the
newly rehabilitated officials

A New Lip with The Electricians' Manual 593 who had just returned from
the camp.  Poor health was one reason Mother did not go back to work,
but the most important reason was that my father had not been
rehabilitated, unlike most capitalist-roaders.

Mao had sanctioned the mass rehabilitation not because he had at last
come to his senses, but because, with the death of Lin Biao and the
inevitable purge of his men, Mao had lost the hand with which he had
controlled the army.  He had removed and alienated virtually all the
other marshals, who opposed the Cultural Revolution, and had had to
rely almost solely on Lin.  He had put his wife, relatives, and stars
of the Cultural Revolution in important army posts, but these people
had no military record, and therefore received no allegiance from the
army.  With Lin gone, Mao had to turn to those purged leaders who still
commanded the loyalty of the army, including Deng Xiaoping, who was
soon to reemerge.  The first concession Mao had to make was to bring
back most of the denounced officials.

Mao also knew that his power depended on a functioning economy.  His
Revolutionary Committees were hopelessly divided and second-rate, and
could not get the country moving.  He had no choice but to turn to the
old, disgraced officials again.

My father was still in Miyi, but the part of his salary which had been
held back since June 1968 was returned to him, and we suddenly found
ourselves with what seemed to us an astronomical sum in the bank.  Our
personal belongings that had been taken away by the Rebels in the house
raids were all returned, the only exception being two bottles of
mao-tai, the most sought-after liquor in China.

There were other encouraging signs.  Zhou Enlai, who now had increased
power, set about getting the economy going.  The old administration was
largely restored, and production and order were emphasized.  Incentives
were reintroduced.  Peasants were allowed some cash sidelines.
Scientific research began again.  Schools started

594 "The Fragrance of Sweet Wind' proper teaching, after a gap of six
years; and my youngest brother, Xiao-fang, belatedly started his
schooling at the age of ten.

With the economy reviving, factories began to recruit new workers.  As
part of the incentive system, they were allowed to give priority to
their employees' children who had been sent to the country.  Though my
parents were not factory employees, my mother spoke to the managers of
a machinery factory that had formerly come under her Eastern District,
and now belonged to the Second Bureau of Light Industry in Chengdu.
They readily agreed to take me on.  So, a few months before my
twentieth birthday, I left Deyang for good.  My sister had to stay,
because young people from the cities who married after going to the
country were banned from returning, even if their spouses had city
registrations.

Becoming a worker was my only option.  Most universities were still
shut, and there were no other careers available.  Being in a factory
meant working only eight hours a day compared with the peasant's
dawn-to-dusk day.  There were no heavy loads to carry, and I could live
with my family.  But the most important thing was getting back my city
registration, which meant guaranteed food and other basics from the
state.

The factory was in the eastern suburbs of Chengdu, about forty-five
minutes by bicycle from home.  For much of the way I rode along the
bank of the Silk River, then along muddy country roads through fields
of rapeseed and wheat.  Finally I reached a shabby-looking enclosure
dotted with piles of bricks and rusting rolled steel.  This was my
factory.  It was a rather primitive enterprise, with some machines
dating back to the turn of the century.  After five years of
denunciation meetings, wall slogans, and physical bat ties between the
factions in the factory, the managers and engineers had just been put
back to work and it had begun to resume producing machine tools.  The
workers gave me a special welcome, largely on account of my

A New Lift with The Electricians' Manual 595 parents: the
destructiveness of the Cultural Revolution had made them hanker for the
old administration, under which there had been order and stability.

I was assigned as an apprentice in the foundry, under a woman whom
everyone called "Auntie Wei."  She had been very poor as a child, and
had not even had a decent pair of trousers when she was a teenager. Her
life had changed when the Communists came, and she was immensely
grateful to them.  She joined the Party, and at the beginning of the
Cultural Revolution she was among the Loyalists who defended the old
Party officials.  When Mao openly backed the Rebels, her group was
beaten into surrender and she was tortured.  A good friend of hers, an
old worker who also owed much to the Communists, died after being hung
horizontally by his wrists and ankles (a torture called 'duck
swimming').  Auntie Wei told me the story of her life in tears, and
said that her fate was tied to that of the Party, which she considered
had been wrecked by 'anti-Party elements' like Lin Biao.  She treated
me like a daughter, primarily because I came from a Communist family. I
felt uneasy with her because I could not match her faith in the
Party.

There were about thirty men and women doing the same job as me, ramming
earth into molds.  The incandescent, bubbling molten iron was lifted
and poured into the molds, generating a mass of sparkling white-hot
stars.  The hoist over our workshop creaked so alarmingly that I was
always worded it might drop the crucible of boiling liquid iron onto
the people ramming away underneath.

My job as a caster was dirty and hard.  I had swollen arms from
pounding the earth into the molds, but I was in high spirits, as I
naively believed that the Cultural Revolution was coming to an end.  I
threw myself into my work with an ardor that would have surprised the
peasants in Deyang.

In spite of my newfound enthusiasm, I was relieved to hear after a
month that I was going to be transferred.  I

could not have sustained ramming eight hours a day for long.  Owing to
the goodwill toward my parents, I was given several jobs to choose from
lathe operator, hoist operator, telephone operator, carpenter, or
electrician.  I dithered between the last two.  I liked the idea of
being able to create lovely wooden things, but decided that I did not
have talented hands.  As an electrician, I would have the glamour of
being the only woman in the factory doing the job.  There had been one
woman in the electricians' team, but she was leaving for another post.
She had always attracted great admiration.  When she climbed to the top
of the electric poles people would stop to marvel.  I struck up an
immediate friendship with this woman, who told me something which made
up my mind for me: electricians did not have to stand by a machine
eight hours a day.  They could stay in their quarters waiting to be
called out on a job.  That meant I would have time to myself to read.

I received five electric shocks in the first month.  Like being a
barefoot doctor, there was no formal training: the result of Mao's
disdain for education.  The six men in the team taught me patiently,
but I started at an abysmally low level.  I did not even know what a
fuse was.  The woman electrician gave me her copy of The Electricians'
Manual and I plunged into it, but still came out confusing electric
current with voltage.  In the end, I felt ashamed of wasting the other
electricians' time, and tried to copy what they did without
understanding much of the theory.  I managed fairly well, and gradually
was able to do some repairs on my own.

One day a worker reported a faulty switch on a power distribution
board.  I went to the back of the board to examine the wiring, and
decided a screw must have come loose.

Instead of switching off the electric supply first, I impetuously poked
my mains-tester cure screwdriver at the screw.

The back of the board was a net of wires, connections, and joints
carrying 380 volts of power.  Once inside this mine field, I had to
push my screwdriver extremely carefully

A New Li/?  with The Electricians' Manual 597 through a gap.  I reached
the screw, only to find it was not loose after all.  By then my arm had
started to shake slightl~ from being taut and nervous.  I began to pull
it back, holding my breath.  Right at the very edge, just as I was
about to relax, a series of colossal jolts shot through my right hand
and down to my feet.  I leaped in the air, and the screwdriver sprang
out of my hand.  It had touched a joint at the entrance to the power
distribution network.  I sagged onto the floor, thinking I could have
been killed if the screwdriver had slipped a lit He earlier.  I did not
tell the other electricians, as I did not want them to feel they had to
go on calls with me.

I got used to the shocks.  No one else made a fuss about them, either.
One old electrician told me that before 1949, when the factory was
privately owned, he had had to use the back of his hand to test the
current.  It was only under the Communists that the factory was obliged
to buy the electricians mains-testers.

There were two rooms in our quarters, and when they were not out on a
call, most of the electricians would play cards in the outer room while
I read in the inner room.  In Mao's China, failure to join the people
around you was criticized as 'cutting oneself off from the masses," and
at first I was nervous about going off on my own to read.  I would put
my book down as soon as one of the other electricians came inside, and
would try to chat with him in a somewhat awkward manner.  As a result
they seldom came in.  I was enormously relieved that they did not
object to my eccentricity.  Rather, they went out of their way not to
disturb me.  Because they were so nice to me I volunteered to do' as
many repairs as possible.

One young electrician in the team, Day, had been in a high school until
the start of the Cultural Revolution, and was considered very well
educated.  He was a good calligrapher and played several musical
instruments beautifully.  I was very attracted to him, and in the
mornings I would always find him leaning against the door to the
electricians'

quarters, waiting to greet me.  I found myself doing a lot of calls
with him.  One early spring day, after finishing a maintenance job, we
spent the lunch break leaning against a haystack at the back of the
foundry, enjoying the first sunny day of the year.  Sparrows were
chirping over our heads, fighting for the grains left on the rice
plants.  The hay gave off an aroma of sunshine and earth.  I was
overjoyed to discover that Day shared my interest in classical Chinese
poetry, and that we could compose poems to each other using the same
rhyme sequence, as ancient Chinese poets had done.  In my generation,
few people understood or liked classical poetry.  We were very late
back to work that afternoon, but there were no criticisms.  The other
electricians only gave us meaningful smiles.

Soon Day and I were counting the minutes during our days off from the
factory, eager to be back together.  We sought every opportunity to be
near each other, to brush each other's fingers, to feel the excitement
of being close, to smell the smell of each other, and to look for
reasons to be hurt or pleased by each other's half-spoken words.

Then I began to hear gossip that Day was unworthy of me.  The
disapproval was partly caused by the fact that I was considered
special.  One of the reasons was that I was the only offspring of high
officials in the factory, and indeed the only one most of the workers
had ever come into contact with.  There had been many stories about
high officials' children being arrogant and spoiled.  I apparently came
as a nice surprise, and some workers seemed to feel that no one in the
factory could possibly be worthy of me.

They held it against Day that his father had been a Kuomintang officer,
and had been in a labor camp.  The workers were convinced I had a
bright future, and should not be 'dragged into misfortune' by being
associated with Day.

Actually, it was purely by chance that Day's father had

A New Lip with The Electricians' Manual 5Uo become a Kuomintang
officer.  In 1937, he and two friends were on their way to Yan'an to
join up with the Communists to fight the Japanese.  They had almost
reached Yan'an when they were stopped at a Kuomintang roadblock where
the officers urged them to join the Kuomintang instead.  While the two
friends insisted on pressing on to Yan'an, Day's father set fled for
the Kuomintang, thinking it did not matter which Chinese army he
joined, as long as it fought the Japanese.  When the civil war re
starred he and his two friends ended up on opposite sides.  After 1949,
he was sent to a labor camp, while his companions became high-ranking
officers in the Communist army.

Because of this accident of history, Day was sniped at in the factory
for not knowing his place by 'pestering' me, and even for being a
social climber.  I could see from his drained face and bitter smiles
that he was stung by the snide gossip, but he said nothing to me.  We
had only hinted at our feelings in allusions in our poems.  Now he
stopped writing poems to me.  The confidence with which he had begun
our friendship disappeared, and he adopted a subdued and humbled manner
toward me in private.  In public, he tried to appease the people who
disapproved of him by awkwardly trying to show them he really thought
nothing of me.  At times I felt that he behaved in such an undignified
way that I could not help being irritated as well as saddened.  Having
been brought up in a privileged position, I did not realize that in
China dignity was a luxury scarcely available to those who were not
privileged.  I did not appreciate Day's dilemma, and the fact that he
could not show his love for me, for fear of ruining me.  Gradually we
became alienated.

During the four months of our acquaintance, the word 'love' had never
been mentioned by either of us.  I had even suppressed it in my mind.
One could never let oneself go, because consideration of the vital
factor, family background, was ingrained in one's mind.  The
consequences of being tied to the family of a 'class enemy' like Day's
were

too serious.  Because of the subconscious self-censorship, I never
quite fell in love with Day.

During this period my mother had come off the cortisone, and had been
receiving treatment with Chinese medicines for her scleroderma.  We had
been scouring country markets for the weird ingredients prescribed for
her tortoiseshell, snake gallbladder, and anteater scales.  The doctors
recommended that as soon as the weather turned warmer, she should go to
see some top-class specialists in Peking for both her womb and the
scleroderma.  As part compensation for what she had suffered, the
authorities offered to send a companion with her.  My mother asked if I
could go.

We left in April 1972, staying with family friends, whom it was now
safe to contact.  My mother saw several gynecologists in Peking and
Tianjin, who diagnosed a benign tumor in her womb and recommended a
hysterectomy.

Meanwhile, they said her bleeding could be controlled if she had plenty
of rest and tried to keep cheerful.  The dermatologists thought that
the scleroderma might be localized, in which case it would not be
fatal.  My mother followed the doctors' advice and had a hysterectomy
the following year.  The scleroderma remained localized.

We visited many friends of my parents.  Everywhere we went, they were
being rehabilitated.  Some had just come out of prison.  Mao-tai and
other treasured liquors flowed freely, as did tears.  In almost every
family, one or more members had died as a result of the Cultural
Revolution.

The eighty-year-old mother of an old friend died after falling off a
landing where she had had to sleep, her family having been driven out
of their apartment.  Another friend struggled to hold back his tears
when he set eyes on me.

I reminded him of his daughter, who would have been my age.  She had
been sent with her school to a godforsaken place on the border with
Siberia, where she had become pregnant.  Frightened, she consulted a
back-street midwife

A New Lift with The Electricians' Manual 6ol who tied musk around her
waist and told her to jump over a wall to get rid of the baby.  She
died of a violent hemorrhage.  Tragic stories cropped up in every
household.  But we also talked about hope, and looked forward to
happier times ahead.

One day we went to see Tung, an old friend of my parents who had just
been released from prison.  He had been my mother's boss on her march
from Manchuria to Sichuan, and had become a bureau chief in the
Ministry of Public Security.  At the beginning of the Cultural
Revolution he was accused of being a Russian spy, and of having
supervised the installation of tape recorders in Mao's quarters which
he had apparently done, under orders.  Every word of Mao's was supposed
to be so precious it had to be preserved, but Mao spoke a dialect which
his secretaries found hard to understand, and in addition they were
sometimes sent out of the room.  In early 1967 Tung was arrested and
sent to the special prison for top people, Qjncheng.  He spent five
years in chains, in solitary confinement.  His legs were like
matchsticks, while from the hips up he was terribly bloated.  His wife
had been forced to denounce him, and had changed the surname of their
children from his to hers to demonstrate that they were cutting him off
forever.  Most of their household things, including his clothes, had
been taken away in house raids.  As a result of Lin Biao's downfall,
Tung's patron, a foe of Lin Biao's, was back in power, and Tung was
released from prison.

His wife was summoned back from her camp in the nor them border region
to be reunited with him.

On the day of his release, she brought him new clothes.

His first words to her were, "You shouldn't have just brought me
material goods.  You should have brought me spiritual food [meaning
Mao's works]."  Tung had been reading nothing but these during his five
years in solitary.

I was staying with his family at the time, and saw him making them
study Mao's articles every day, with a seriousness which I found more
tragic than ridiculous.

A few months after our visit Tung was sent to supervise a case in a
port in the south.  His long confinement had left him unfit for a
demanding job, and he soon had a heart attack.  The government
dispatched a special plane to take him to a hospital in Guangzhou.  The
lift in the hospital was not working, and he insisted on walking up
four floors because he considered being carried upstairs against
Communist morality.  He died on the operating table.  His family was
not with him because he had left word that 'they should not interrupt
their work."

It was while we were staying with Tung and his family at the end of May
1972 that my mother and I received a telegram saying my father had been
allowed to leave his camp.  After the fall of Lin Biao, the camp
doctors had at last given my father a diagnosis, saying that he was
suffering from dangerously high blood pressure, serious heart and liver
trouble, and vascular sclerosis.  They recommended a complete checkup
in Peking.

He took a train to Chengdu, and then flew to Peking.

Because there was no public transport to the airport for non passengers
my mother and I had to wait to meet him at the city terminal.  He was
thin and burned almost black by the sun.  It was the first time in
three and a half years that he had been out of the mountains of Miyi.
For the first few days he seemed at a loss in the big city, and would
refer to crossing the road as 'crossing the river' and taking a bus as
'taking a boat."  He walked hesitantly on the crowded streets and
looked somewhat baffled by all the traffic.  I assumed the role of his
guide.  We stayed with an old friend of his from Yibin who had also
suffered atrociously in the Cultural Revolution.

Apart from this man and Tung, my father did not visit anyone because he
had not been rehabilitated.  Unlike me, who was full of optimism, he
was heavy-hearted most of the lime.  To try to cheer him up, I dragged
him and my mother out sight-seeing in temperatures sometimes exceeding
xoo F. Once I half-forced him to go to the

A New LiE with The Electricians' Manual ~o3 Great Wall with me in a
crowded coach, choking with dust and sweat.  As I babbled away, he
listened with pensive smiles.  A baby in the arms of a peasant woman
sitting in front of us started crying, and she smacked it hard.  My
father shot up from his seat and yelled at her, "Don't you hit the
baby!"  I hurriedly pulled his sleeve and made him sit down.  The whole
coach stared at us.  It was most unusual for a Chinese to interfere in
a matter like this.  I thought with a sigh of how my father had changed
from the days when he had beaten Jin-ming and Xiao-her.

In Peking I also read books which opened new horizons for me. President
Nixon had visited China in February that year.  The official line was
that he had come 'with a white flag."  The idea that America was the
number-one enemy had by now vanished from my mind, together with much
of my indoctrination.  I was overjoyed that Nixon had come because his
visit helped generate a new climate in which some translations of
foreign books were becoming available.  They were marked 'for internal
circulation," which meant in theory that they were to be read only by
authorized personnel, but there were no rules specifying to whom they
should be circulated, and they passed freely between friends if one of
them had privileged access through their job.

I was able to lay my hands on some of these publications.

It was with unimaginable pleasure that I read Nixon's own Six Crises
(somewhat expurgated, of course, given his antiCommunist past), David
Halberstam's The Best and the Brightest, William L. Shirer's The Rise
and Fall of the Third Reich, and The Winds of War by Herman Wouk, with
their (to me) up-to-date picture of the outside world.  The
descriptions of the Kennedy administration in The Best and the
Brightest made me marvel at the relaxed atmosphere of the American
government, in contrast with my own so remote, frightening, and
secretive.  I was captivated by the style of writing in the nonfiction
works.  How cool and detached it was!  Even Nixon's Six Crises seemed a
model of calmness compared with the sledgehammer style of the Chinese
media, full of hectoring, denunciations, and assertions.  In The Winds
of War I was less impressed by its majestic descriptions of the times
than by its vignettes showing the uninhibited fuss that Western women
could make about their clothing, by their easy access to it and by the
range of colors and styles available.  At twenty, I had only a few
clothes, in the same style as everybody else, almost every piece blue,
gray, or white.  I closed my eyes and caressed in my imagination all
the beautiful dresses I had never seen or worn.

The increased availability of information from abroad was, of course,
part of the general liberalization after the downfall of Lin Biao, but
Nixon's visit gave it a convenient pretext the Chinese must not lose
face by showing themselves to be totally ignorant of America.  In those
days, every step in the process of relaxation had to be given some
farfetched political justification.  Learning English was now a worthy
cause for 'winning friends from all over the world' and was therefore
no longer a crime.  So as not to alarm or frighten our distinguished
guest, streets and restaurants lost the militant names that had been
imposed on them at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution by the Red
Guards.  In Chengdu, although it was not visited by Nixon, the
restaurant The Whiff of Gunpowder switched back to its old name, The
Fragrance of Sweet Wind.

I was in Peking for five months.  Whenever I was alone, I thought of
Day.  We did not write to each other.  I composed poems to him, but
kept them to myself.  Eventually, my hope for the future conquered my
regrets about the past.

One piece of news in particular overshadowed all my other thoughts for
the first time since I was fourteen I saw the possibility of a future I
had not dared to dream about: I might be able to go to college.  In
Peking, small numbers of students had been enrolled in the previous
couple of years, and it looked as though universities all over the
country would be opening soon.  Zhou Enlai was emphasizing a quote by
Mao to the effect that universities were still needed, particularly for
science and techno log I could not wait to get back to Chengdu to start
studying to try t~ get in.

I returned to the factory in September ~972, and sa,a Day without too
much pain.  He had also become calm, only occasionally revealing a
glimpse of melancholy.  We were good friends again, but we no longer
talked about poetry.  I buried myself in my preparations for a
universin' course, although I had no idea which.  It was not up to me
to choose, as Mao had said that 'education must be thoroughly
revolutionized."  This meant, among other things, that university
students were to be assigned to courses with no consideration for what
they were interested in that would be individualism, a capitalist vice.
I began to study all the major subjects: Chinese, math, physics,
chemistry, biology, and English.

Mao had also decreed that students were not to come from the
traditional source middle-school graduates but had to be workers or
peasants.  This suited me, as I had been a genuine peasant and was now
a worker.

There was to be an entrance exam, Zhou Enlai had decided, although he
had to change the term 'exam' (kaoshO to 'an investigation into the
candidates' situation of handling some basic knowledge, and their
ability to analyze and solve concrete problems," a criterion based on
another Mao quote.  Mao did not like exams.  The new procedure was that
first one had to be recommended by one's work unit, then came entrance
examinations, then the enrollment authorities weighed the exam results
and the applicant's 'political behavior."

For nearly ten months I spent all my evenings and weekends, and much of
my time at the factory as well, poring over textb9oks that had survived
the flames of the Red Guards.  They came from many friends.  I also had
a network of tutors who gave up their evenings and holidays happily and
enthusiastically.  People who loved learning felt a rapport which bound
them together.  This was the reaction from a nation with a highly
sophisticated civilization which had been subjected to virtual
extinction.

In spring 1973, Deng Xiaoping was rehabilitated and appointed
vice-premier, the de facto deputy to the ailing Zhou Enlai.  I was
thrilled.  Deng's comeback seemed to me a sure sign that the Cultural
Revolution was being reversed.  He was known to be dedicated to
construction rather than destruction, and was an excellent
administrator.  Mao had sent him away to a tractor factory in relative
security to keep him in reserve in case of Zhou Enlai's demise.  No
matter how power-crazed, Mao was always careful not to burn his
bridges.

I was delighted at Deng's rehabilitation for personal reasons as well.
I had known his stepmother very well when I was a child, and his
half-sister was our neighbor for years in the compound we all called
her "Auntie Deng."  She and her husband had been denounced simply
because they were related to Deng, and the compound residents who had
fawned over her before the Cultural Revolution shunned her.  But my
family greeted her as usual.  At the same time, she was one of the very
few people in the compound who would tell my family how they admired my
father at the height of his persecution.  In those days even a nod, or
a fleeting smile, was rare and precious, and our two families developed
very warm feelings for each other.

In the summer of 1973, university enrollment started.  I felt as if I
was awaiting a sentence of life or death.  One place in the Foreign
Languages Department at Sichuan University was allocated to the Second
Bureau of Light Industry in Chengdu, which had twenty-three factories
under it, mine being one of them.  Each of the factories had to
nominate one candidate to sit for exams.  In my factory there were
several hundred workers, and six people applied, including me.  An
election was held to select the candidate, and I was chosen by four of
the factory's five workshops.

In my own workshop there was another candidate, a friend of mine who
was nineteen.  Both of us were popular, but our work mates could only
vote for one of us.  Her name was read out first; there was an awkward
stirring it was clear that people could not decide what to do.  I was
miserable in the extreme if there were a lot of votes for her, there
would be fewer for me.  Suddenly she stood up and said with a smile,
"I'd like to forgo my candidacy and vote for Chang Jung.  I'm two years
younger than she is.  I'll try next year."  The workers burst out in
relieved laughter, and promised to vote for her next year.  And they
did.  She went to the university in 1974.

I was hugely moved by her gesture, and also by the outcome of the vote.
It was as if the workers were helping me to achieve my dreams.  My
family background did not hurt, either.  Day did not apply: he knew he
had no chance.

I took the Chinese, math, and English exams.  I was so nervous the
night before that I could not sleep.  When I came home for the lunch
break, my sister was waiting for me.  She massaged my head gently, and
I fell into a light snooze.  The papers were very elementary, and
scarcely touched on my assiduously imbibed geometry, trigonometry,
physics, and chemistry.  I got honors in all my papers, and for my
English oral I got the highest mark of all the candidates in Chengdu.

Before I could relax, there came a crushing blow.  On 20 July an
article appeared in the People's Daily about a 'blank exam paper."
Unable to answer the questions in his university entrance papers, an
applicant called Zhang Tie-sheng, who had been sent to the countryside
near Jinzhou, had handed in a blank sheet, along with a letter
complaining that the exams were tantamount to a 'capitalist
restoration."  His letter was seized on by Mao's nephew and personal
aide, Mao Yuanxin, who was running the province.  Mme Mao and her
cohorts condemned the emphasis on academic standards as 'bourgeois
dictatorship."

"What does it matter even if the whole country becomes illiterate?"
they declared.

"What matters is that the Cultural Revolution achieves the greatest
miumph!"

The exams I had taken were declared void.  Entrance to universities was
now to be decided solely by 'political behavior."  How that should be
measured became a big question.  The recommendation from my factory had
been written after a 'collective appraisal meeting' of the
electricians' team.  Day had drafted it and my former female
electrician master had polished it.  It made me out to be an absolute
paragon, the most model worker that ever existed.

I had no doubt that the other twenty-two candidates had exactly the
same credentials.  There was therefore no way to differentiate between
us.

The official propaganda was not much help.  One widely publicized
'hero' shouted, "You ask me for my qualification for university?  My
qualification is this!"  at which he raised his hands and pointed at
his calluses.  But we all had calluses on our hands.  We had all been
in factories, and most had worked on farms.

There was only one alternative: the back door.

Most directors of the Sichuan Enrollment Committee were old colleagues
of my father's who had been rehabilitated, and they admired his courage
and integrity.  But, much though he wanted me to have a university
education, my father would not ask them to help.

"It would not be fair to people with no power," he said.

"What would our country become if things had to be done this way?"  I
started to argue with him, and ended up in tears.  I must have looked
truly heartbroken, because eventually he said, with a pained face.

"All right, I'll do it."

I took his arm and we walked to a hospital about a mile away where one
of the directors of the Enrollment Committee was having a checkup:
nearly all victims of the Cultural Revolution suffered appalling health
as a result of their ordeals.  My father walked slowly, with the help
of a stick.  His old energy and sharpness had disappeared.

Watching him shuffling along, stopping to rest every now and then,
battling with his mind as well as his legs, I wanted to say "Let's go
back."  But I also desperately wanted to get into the university.

On the hospital grounds we sat on the edge of a low stone bridge to
rest.  My father looked in torment.  Eventually he said, "Would you
forgive me?  I really find it very difficult to do this .... For a
second I felt a surge of resentment, and wanted to cry out at him that
there was no fairer alternative.  I wanted to tell him how much I had
dreamed of going to the university, and that I deserved it for my hard
work, for my exam results, and because I had been elected.  But I knew
my father knew all this.  And it was he who had given me my thirst for
knowledge.  Still, he had his principles, and because I loved him I had
to accept him as he was, and understand his dilemma of being a moral
man living in a land which was a moral void.  I held back my tears and
said, "Of course."  We trudged back home in silence.

How lucky I was to have my resourceful mother!  She went to the wife of
the head of the Enrollment Committee, who then spoke to her husband. My
mother also went to see the other chiefs, and got them to back me. She
emphasized my exam results, which she knew would be the clincher for
these former capitalist-roaders.  In October 1973, I entered the
Foreign Languages Depa~unent of Sichuan University in Chengdu to study
English.

20.  "Sniffing after Foreigners' Farts and Calling Them Sweet'-Learning
English in Mao's Wake

(1971-1974)

Since her return from Peking in autumn 1972, helping her five children
had been my mother's major occupation.

My youngest brother, Xiao-fang, then aged ten, needed daily coaching to
make up for his missed school years, and the future of her other
children depended largely on her.

With the society half paralyzed for over six years, an enormous number
of social problems had been created, and simply left unsolved.  One of
the most serious was the many millions of young people who had been
sent to the countryside and who were desperate to come back to the
cities.  After the demise of Lin Biao it began to be possible for some
to get back, partly because the state needed labor for the urban
economy, which it was now trying to revitalize.  But the government
also had to put strict limits on the number who could return because it
was state policy in China to control the population of the cities: the
state took it on itself to guarantee the urban population food,
housing, and jobs.

So competition for the limited 'return tickets' was fierce.

The state created regulations to keep the number down.

Marriage was one criterion for exclusion.  Once married, no
organization in the city would take you.  It was on these grounds that
my sister was disqualified from applying for a job in the city, or to a
university, which were the only legitimate ways to get back to Chengdu.
She was extremely miserable, as she wanted to join her husband; his
factory had started working normally again, and as a result he could
not go to Deyang and live with her, except for the official 'marriage
leave' of just twelve days a year.  Her only chance of getting to
Chengdu was to obtain a certificate that said she had an incurable
disease which was what many like her were doing.  So my mother had to
help her get one from a doctor Mend which said Xiao-hong suffered from
cirrhosis of the liver.  She came back to Chengdu at the end of 197z.

The way to get things done now was through personal connections.  There
were people coming to see my mother every day schoolteachers, doctors,
nurses, actors, and minor officials appealing for help to get their
children out of the countryside.  Often she was their only hope,
although she had no job, and she pulled strings on their behalf with
unflagging energy.  My father would not help;

he was too set in his ways to start 'fixing."

Even when the official channel worked, the personal connection was
still essential to make sure things went smoothly and to avoid
potential disaster.  My brotherJin-ming got out of his village in March
1972.  Two organizations were recruiting new workers from his commune:
one was a factory in his county town making electrical appliances, the
other an unspecified enterprise in the Western District of Chengdu.
Jin-ming wanted to get back to Chengdu, but my mother made inquiries
among her friends in the Western District and found out that the job
was in a slaughterhouse.

Jin-ming immediately withdrew his application and went to work in the
local factory instead.

It was in fact a large plant which had relocated from Shanghai in 1966
as part of Mao's plan to conceal industry in the mountains of Sichuan
against an American or Soviet attack.  Jin-ming impressed his fellow
workers with his hard work and fairness, and in 1973 he was one of four
young people elected by the factory to attend a university, out of 200
applicants.  He passed his exam papers brilliantly and effortlessly.
But because Father had not been rehabilitated, my mother had to make
sure that when the university came to do the obligatory 'political
investigation' they would not be scared off, and would instead get the
impression that he was about to be cleared.  She also had to ensure
that Jin-ming was not pushed out by some failed applicant with powerful
connections.  In October 1973, when I went to Sichuan University,
Jin-ming was admitted to the Engineering College of Central China at
Wuhan to study casting.

He would have preferred to do physics, but he was in seventh heaven
anyway.

While Jin-ming and I had been preparing to try to get into a
university, my second brother, Xiao-her, was living in a state of
despondency.  The basic qualification for university entrance was that
one had to have been either a worker, a peasant, or a soldier, and he
had been none of these.  The government was still expelling urban youth
en masse to the rural areas, and this was the only future facing him
except joining the armed forces.  Dozens applied for every place, and
the only way in was via connections.

My mother got Xiao-her in in December 1972, against almost impossible
odds, as my father had not been cleared.

Xiao-her was assigned to an air force college in northern China, and
after three months' basic training became a radio operator.  He worked
five hours a day, in a supremely leisurely manner, and spent the rest
of the time in 'political studies' and producing food.

In the 'studies' sessions everyone claimed they had joined the armed
forces 'to follow the Party's command, to protect the people, to
safeguard the motherland."  But

Learning English in Mao's 14like 613 there were more pertinent reasons.
The young men from the cities wanted to avoid being sent to the
countryside, and those from the country hoped to use the army as a
springboard to leap into the city.  For peasants from poor areas, being
in the armed forces meant at least a better filled stomach.

As the 197os unfolded, joining the Party, like joining the army, became
increasingly unrelated to ideological commitment.  Everyone said in
their applications that the Party was 'great, glorious, and correct,"
and that 'to join the Party means to devote my life to the most
splendid cause of mankind the liberation of the world proletariat."

But for most the real reason was personal advantage.  This was the
obligatory step to becoming an officer; and when an officer was
discharged he automatically became a 'state official," with a secure
salary, prestige, and power, not to mention a city registration.  A
private had to go back to his village and become a peasant again. Every
year before discharge time there would be stories of suicides,
breakdowns, and depressions.

One evening Xiao-her was sitting with about a thousand soldiers and
officers, and the officers' families, watching an open-air movie.

Suddenly submachine-gun fire crackled out, followed by a huge
explosion.  The audience scattered, screaming.

The shots came from a guard who was about to be discharged and sent
back to his village, having failed to get into the Party and thus to be
promoted to officer grade.

First he shot dead the commissar of his company, whom he held
responsible for blocking his promotion, and then he fired at random
into the crowd, tossing a hand grenade.

Five more people were killed, all women and children from officers'
families.  Over a dozen were wounded.  He then fled into a residential
block, where he was besieged by fellow soldiers, who shouted at him
through megaphones to surrender.  But the moment the guard fired out of
the window, they broke and ran, to the amusement of the

6I4 "Sniffing after Foreigners' Farts..."

hundreds of excited onlookers.  Finally, a special unit arrived.  After
a fierce exchange of fire, they broke into the apartment and found the
guard had committed suicide.

Like everyone else around him, Xiao-her wanted to get into the Party.
It was not such a matter of life and death for him as for the peasant
soldiers, since he knew he would not have to go to the countryside
after his military career.

The rule was that you went back to where you came from, so he would
automatically be given a job in Chengdu whether he was a Party member
or not.  But the job would be better if he was a Party member.  He
would also have more access to information, which was important to him,
since China at the time was an intellectual desert, with almost nothing
to read apart from the crudest propaganda.

Besides these practical considerations, par was never absent.  For many
people, joining the Party was rather like taking out an insurance
policy.  Party membership meant you were less distrusted, and this
sense of relative security was very comforting.  What was more, in an
extremely political environment like the one Xiao-her was in, if he did
not want to join the Party it would be noted in his personal file and
suspicion would follow him: "Why does he not want to join the Party?"
To apply and not be accepted was also likely to give rise to suspicion:
"Why was he not accepted?  There must be something wrong with him."

Xiao-her had been reading Marxist classics with genuine interest they
were the only books available, and he needed something to satisfy his
intellectual thirst.  Because the Communist Party charter stated that
studying Marxism-Leninism was the first qualification for being a Party
member, he thought he could combine his interest with practical gain.
But neither his bosses nor his comrades were impressed.  In fact, they
felt shown up because, coming mostly from peasant backgrounds and being
semiliterate, they could not understand Marx.  Xiao-her was criticized
for being arrogant and cutting himself off from the masses.  If he
wanted to join the Party, he would have to find another way.

The most important thing, he soon realized, was to please his immediate
bosses.  The next was to please his comrades.  In addition to being
popular and working hard at his job, he had to 'serve the people' in
the most literal sense.

Unlike most armies, which assign unpleasant and menial tasks to the
lower ranks, the Chinese army operated by waiting for people to
volunteer for jobs like fetching water for morning ablutions and
sweeping the grounds.  Reveille was at 6:3o a.m.; the 'honored task' of
getting up before this fell to those who aspired to join the Party. And
there were so many of them they fought each other for the brooms. In
order to secure a broom, people got up earlier and earlier.  One
morning Xiao-her heard someone sweeping the grounds just after 4 a.m.

There were other important chores, and the one which counted most was
helping to produce food.  The basic food allowance was very small, even
for officers.  There was meat only once a week.  So every company had
to grow its own grain and vegetables and raise its own pigs.  At
harvest time the company commissar would often deliver pep talks:

"Comrades, now is the time of testing by the Party!  We must finish the
whole field by this evening!  Yes, the work needs ten times the
manpower we have.  But every one of us revolutionary fighters can do
the job of ten men!

Communist Party members must take a leading role.  For those who want
to join the Party, this is the best time to prove yourselves!  Those
who have passed the test will be able to join the Party on the
battlefield at the end of the day!"

Party members did have to work hard to fulfill their 'leading role,"
but it was the aspiring applicants who really had to exert themselves.
On one occasion, Xiao-her became so exhausted that he collapsed in the
middle of a
field.  While the new members who had earned 'battlefield enrollment'
raised their right fists and gave the standard pledge 'to fight all my
life for the glorious Communist cause," Xiao-her was taken to a
hospital, where he had to stay for days.

The most direct path to the company had several dozen of unequaled
place in the hearts

Party was raising pigs.  The these, and they occupied an of the
soldiers; officers and men alike would hang around the pigsty,
observing, commenting, and willing the animals to grow.  If the pigs
were doing well, the swine herds were the darlings of the company, and
there were many contestants for this profession.

Xiao-her became a full-time swineherd.  It was hard, filthy work, not
to mention the psychological pressure.

Every night he and his colleagues took turns to get up in the small
hours to give the pigs an extra feed.  When a sow produced piglets they
kept watch night after night in case she crushed them.  Precious
soybeans were carefully picked, washed, ground, strained, made into
'soybean milk," and lovingly fed to the mother to stimulate her milk.

Life in the air force was very unlike what Xiao-her had imagined.
Producing food took up more than a third of the entire time he was in
the military.  At the end of a year's arduous pig raising, Xiao-her was
accepted into the Party.

Like many others, he put his feet up and began to take it easy.

After membership in the Party, everyone's ambition was to become an
officer; whatever advantage the former brought, the latter doubled it.
Getting to be an officer depended on being picked by one's superiors,
so the key was never to displease them.  One day Xiao-her was summoned
to see one of the college's political commissars.

Xiao-her was on tenterhooks, not knowing whether he was in for some
unexpected good fortune or total disaster.  The commissar, a plump man
in his fifties with puffy eyes and a loud, commanding voice, looked
exceedingly benign as he lit up a cigarette and asked Xiao-her about
his family background, age, and state of health.  He also asked whether
he had a fiance to which Xiao-her replied that he did not.  It struck
Xiao-her as a good sign that the man was being so personal.  The
commissar went on to praise him: "You have studied Marxism-Leninism-Mao
Zedong Thought conscientiously.  You have worked hard.  The masses have
a good impression of you.  Of course, you must keep on being modest;
modesty makes you progress," and so on.  By the time the commissar
stubbed out his cigarette, Xiao-her thought his promotion was in his
pocket.

The commissar lit a second cigarette and began to tell a story about a
fire in a cotton mill, and about a woman spinner who had been severely
burned dashing back in to rescue 'state property."  In fact, all her
limbs had had to be amputated, so that there was only a head and a
torso left, although, the commissar stressed, her face had not been
destroyed, or more important her ability to produce babies.  She was,
said the commissar, a heroine, and was going to be publicized on a
grand scale in the press.  The Party would like to grant all her
wishes, and she had said that she wanted to marry an air force officer.
Xiao-her was young, handsome, unattached, and could be made an officer
at any time .... Xiao-her sympathized with the lady, but marrying her
was another matter.  But how could he refuse the commissar?  He could
not produce any convincing reasons.  Love?

Love was supposed to be bound up with 'class feelings," and who could
deserve more class feelings than a Communist heroine?  Saying he did
not know her would not get him off the hook either.  Many marriages in
China had been the result of an arrangement by the Party.  As a Party
member, particularly one hoping to become an officer, Xiao-her was
supposed to say: "I resolutely obey the Party's decision!"  He bitterly
regretted having said he had no fiance.  His mind was racing to think
of a way to say no tactfully as the commissar went on about the
advantages:

immediate promotion to officer, publicity as a hero, a fulltime nurse,
and a large allowance for life.

The commissar lit yet another cigarette, and paused.

Xiao-her weighed his words.  Taking a calculated risk, he asked if this
was already an irreversible Party decision.  He knew the Party always
preferred people to 'volunteer."  As he expected, the commissar said
no: it was up to Xiao-her.

Xiao-her decided to bluff his way through: he 'confessed' that although
he did not have a fiancte, his mother had arranged a girlfriend for
him.  He knew this girlfriend had to be good enough to knock out the
heroine, and this meant possessing two attributes: the right class
background and good works in that order.  So she became the daughter of
the commander of a big army region, and worked in an army hospital.
They had just begun 'talking about love."

The commissar backed off, saying he had only wanted to see how Xiao-her
felt, and had no intention of forcing a match on him.  Xiao-her was not
punished, and not long afterward he became an officer and was put in
charge of a ground radio communications unit.  A young man from a
peasant background came forward to marry the disabled heroine.

Meanwhile, Mme Mao and her cohorts were renewing their efforts to
prevent the country from working.  In industry, their slogan was: "To
stop production is revolution itself."  In agriculture, in which they
now began to meddle seriously: "We would rather have socialist weeds
than capitalist crops."  Acquiring foreign technology became 'sniffing
after foreigners' farts and calling them sweet."  In education: "We
want illiterate working people, not educated spiritual aristocrats."
They called for schoolchildren to rebel against their teachers again;
in January 1974, classroom windows, tables, and chairs in schools in
Peking were smashed, as in 1966.  Mme Mao claimed this was like 'the

Learning English in Mao's 14ake 610 revolutionary action of English
workers destro~4ng machines in the eighteenth century."  All this
demagogueD' had one purpose: to create trouble for Zhou Enlai and Deng
Xiaoping and generate chaos.  It was only in persecuting people and in
destruaion that Mme Mao and the other luminaries of the Cultural
Revolution had a chance to 'shine."  In construaion they had no
place.

Zhou and Deng had been making tentative efforts to open the country up,
so Mme Mao launched a fresh attack on foreign culture.  In early 1974
there was a big media campaign denouncing the Italian director
Michelangelo Antonioni for a film he had made about China, although no
one in China had seen the film, and few had even heard of it or of
Antonioni.  This xenophobia was extended to Beethoven after a visit by
the Philadelphia Orchestra.

In the two years since the fall of Lin Biao, my mood had changed from
hope to despair and fury.  The only source of comfort was that there
was a fight going on at all, and that the lunacy was not reigning
supreme, as it had in the earlier years of the Cultural Revolution.
During this period, Mao was not giving his full backing to either
side.

He hated the efforts of Zhou and Deng to reverse the Cultural
Revolution, but he knew that his wife and her acolytes could not make
the country work.

Mao let Zhou carry on with the administration of the country, but set
his wife upon Zhou, particularly in a new campaign to 'criticize
Confucius."  The slogans ostensibly denounced Lin Biao, but were really
aimed at Zhou, who, it was widely held, epitomized the virtues
advocated by the ancient sage.  Even though Zhou had been unwaveringly
loyal, Mao still could not leave him alone.  Not even now, when Zhou
was fatally ill with advanced cancer of the bladder.

It was in this period that I started to realize that it was Mao who was
really responsible for the Cultural Revolution.  But I still did not
condemn him explicitly, even in my own mind.  It was so difficult to
destroy a god!  But,

psychologically, I was ripe for his name to be spelled out for me.

Education became the front line of the sabotage by Mme Mao and her
cabal, because it was not immediately vital to the economy and because
every attempt at learning and teaching involved a reversal of the
glorified ignorance of the Cultural Revolution.  When I entered the
university, I found myself in a battlefield.

Sichuan University had been the headquarters of 26 August, the Rebel
group that had been the task force of the Tings, and the buildings were
pockmarked with scars from the seven years of the Cultural Revolution.
Scarcely a window was intact.  The pond in the middle of the campus,
once renowned for its elegant lotuses and goldfish, was now a stinking,
mosquito-breeding swamp.  The French plane trees which lined the avenue
leading from the main gate had been mutilated.

The moment I entered the university a political campaign started up
against 'going through the back door."  Of course, there was no mention
of the fact that it was the Cultural Revolution leaders themselves who
had blocked the 'front door."  I could see that there were a lot of
high officials' children among the new 'worker-peasant-soldier'
students, and that virtually all the rest had connections the peasants
with their production team leaders or commune secretaries, the workers
with their factory bosses, if they were not petty officials themselves.
The 'back door' was the only way in.  My fellow students demonstrated
lit He vigor in this campaign.

Every afternoon, and some evenings, we had to 'study' turgid People's
Daily articles denouncing one thing or another, and hold nonsensical
'discussions' at which everyone repeated the newspaper's overblown,
vapid language.

We had to stay on the campus all the time, except Saturday evening and
Sunday, and had to return by Sunday evening.

I shared a bedroom with five other girls.  There were

Learning English in Mao's Wake 62 I two tiers of three bunk beds on
opposite walls.  In between was a table and six chairs where we did our
work.  There was scarcely room for our washbasins.  The window opened
onto a stinking open sewer.

English was my subject, but there was almost no way to learn it.  There
were no native English speakers around, indeed no foreigners at all.
The whole of Sichuan was closed to foreigners.  Occasionally the odd
one was let in, always a 'friend of China," but even to speak to them
without authorization was a criminal offense.  We could be put into
prison for listening to the BBC or the Voice of America.

No foreign publications were available except The Worker, the paper of
the minuscule Maoist Communist Party of Britain, and even this was
locked up in a special room.  I remember the thrill of being given
permission once, just once, to look at a copy.  My excitement wilted
when my eyes fell on the front-page article echoing the campaign to
criticize Confucius.  As I was sitting there nonplussed, a lecturer
whom I liked walked past and said with a smile, "That paper is probably
read only in China."

Our textbooks were ridiculous propaganda.  The first English sentence
we learned was "Long live Chairman Mao!"  But no one dared to explain
the sentence grammatically.  In Chinese the term for the optative mood,
expressing a wish or desire, means 'something unreal."  In 1966 a
lecturer at Sichuan University had been beaten up for 'having the
audacity to suggest that "Long live Chairman Mao!"  was unreal!"  One
chapter was about a model youth hero who had drowned after jumping into
a flood to save an electricity pole because the pole would be used to
carry the word of Mao.

With great difficulty, I managed to borrow some English language
textbooks published before the Cultural Revolution from lecturers in my
depa~unent and from Jin-ming, who sent me books from his university by
post.  These contained extracts from writers like Jane Austen, Charles
Dickens, and Oscar Wilde, and stories from European and

American history.  They were a joy to read, but much of my energy went
toward finding them and then trying to keep them.

Whenever someone approached, I would quickly cover the books with a
newspaper.  This was only partly because of their 'bourgeois' content.
It was also important not to appear to be studying too conscientiously,
and not to arouse my fellow students' jealousy by reading something far
beyond them.  Although we were studying English, and were paid par fly
for our propaganda value by the government to do this, we must not be
seen to be too devoted to our subject: that was considered being 'white
and expert."  In the mad logic of the day, being good at one's
profession ('expert') was automatically equated with being politically
unreliable ('white').

I had the misfortune to be better at English than my classmates, and
was therefore resented by some of the 'student officials," the
lowest-level controllers, who supervised political indoctrination
sessions and checked the 'thought conditions' of their fellow students.
The student officials in my course had mostly come from the
countryside.  They were keen to learn English, but most of them were
semi-literate, and had lit He aptitude.  I sympathized with their
anxiety and frustration, and understood their jealousy of me.  But
Mao's concept of 'white and expert' made them feel virtuous about their
inadequacies, and gave their envy political respectability, and them a
malicious opportunity to vent their exasperation.

Every now and then a student official would require a 'heart-to-heart'
with me.  The leader of the Party cell in my course was a former
peasant named Ming who had joined the army and then become a production
team leader.  He was a very poor student, and would give me long,
righteous lectures about the latest developments in the Cultural
Revolution, the 'glorious tasks of us worker peasant-soldier students,"
and the need for 'thought reform."  I needed these heart-to-hearts
because of my

Learning English in Mao's Pl~kc 02.;

'shortcomings," but Ming would never come straight to the point.  He
would let a criticism hang in midair "The masses have a complaint about
you.  Do you know what it is?"  and watch the effect on me.  He would
eventually disclose some allegation.  One day it was the inc~itablc
charge that I was 'white and expert."  Another day I was 'bourgeois'
because I failed to fight for the chance to clean the toilet, or to
wash my comrades' clothes all obligatory good deeds.  And yet another
time he would attribute a despicable motive: that I did not spend most
of my time tutoring my classmates because I did not want them to catch
up with me.

One criticism that Ming would put to me with trembling lips (he
obviously felt strongly about it) was "The masses have reported that
you are aloof.  You cut yourself off from the masses."  It was common
in China for people to assert that you were looking down on them if you
failed to hide your desire for some solitude.

One level up from the student officials were the political supervisors,
who also knew little or no English.  They did not like me.  Nor I them.
From time to time I had to report my thoughts to the one in charge of
my year, and before every session I would wander around the campus for
hours summoning up the courage to knock on his door.  Although he was
not, I believed, an evil person, I feared him.  But most of all I
dreaded the inevitable tedious, ambiguous diatribe.  Like many others,
he loved playing cat and mouse to indulge his feeling of power.  I had
to look humble and earnest, and promise things I did not mean and had
no intention of doing.

I began to feel nostalgia for my years in the countryside and the
factory, when I had been left relatively alone.  Universities were much
more tightly controlled, being of particular interest to Mme Mao.  Now
I was among people who had benefited from the Cultural Revolution.
Without it, many of them would never have been here.

Once some students in my year were given the project

624 "Snij~ng after Foreigners' Farts..."

of compiling a dictionary of English abbreviations.  The department had
decided that the existing one was 'reactionary' because, not
surprisingly, it had far more 'capitalist' abbreviations than ones with
an approved origin.

"Why should Roosevelt have an abbreviation FDR and not Chairman Mao?"
some students asked indignantly.  With tremendous solemnity they
searched for acceptable entries, but eventually had to give up their
'historic mission' as there simply were not enough of the right
kinds.

I found this environment unbearable.  I could understand ignorance, but
I could not accept its glorification, still less its right to rule.

We often had to leave the university to do things that were irrelevant
to our subjects.  Mao had said that we should 'learn things in
factories, the countryside, and army units."  What exactly we were
meant to learn was, typically, unspecified.  We started with 'learning
in the countryside."

One week into the first term of my first year, in October 1973, the
whole university was packed off to a place on the outskirts of Chengdu
called Mount Dragon Spring, which had been the victim of a visit by one
of China's vice-premiers, Chen Yonggui.  He was previously the leader
of a farming brigade called Dazhai in the mountainous northern province
of Shanxi, which had become Mao's model in agriculture, ostensibly
because it relied more on the peasants' revolutionary zeal than on
material incentives.

Mao did not notice, or did not care, that Dazhai's claims were largely
fraudulent.  When Vice-Premier Chen visited Mount Dragon Spring he had
remarked, "All, you have mountains here!  Imagine how many fields you
could create!"  as if the fertile hills covered in orchards were like
the barren mountains of his native village.  But his remarks had the
force of law.  The crowds of university students dynamited the orchards
that had provided Chengdu with apples, plums, peaches, and flowers.  We
transported stones from afar with pull carts and shoulder poles, for
the construction of terraced rice paddies.

It was compulsory to demonstrate zeal in this, as in all actions called
for by Mao.  Many of my fellow students worked in a manner that
screamed out for notice.  I was regarded as lacking in enthusiasm, par
fly because I had difficulty hiding my aversion to this activity, and
partly because I did not sweat easily, no matter how much energy I
expended.  Those students whose sweat poured out in streams were
invariably praised at the summing-up sessions every evening.

My university colleagues were certainly more eager than proficient. The
sticks of dynamite they shoved into the ground usually failed to go
off, which was just as well, as there were no safety precautions.  The
stone walls we built around the terraced edges soon collapsed, and by
the time we left, after two weeks, the mountain slope was a wasteland
of blast holes, cement solidified into shapeless masses, and piles of
stones.  Few seemed concerned about this.

The whole episode was ultimately a show, a piece of theater - a
pointless means to a pointless end.

I loathed these expeditions and hated the fact that our labor, and our
whole existence, was being used for a shoddy political game.  To my
intense irritation, I was sent off to an army unit, again with the
whole university, in late 1974.

The camp, a couple of hours' truck journey from Chengdu, was in a
beautiful spot, surrounded by rice paddies, peach blossoms, and bamboo
groves.  But our seventeen days there felt like a year.  I was
perpetually breathless from the long runs every morning, bruised from
falling and crawling under the imaginary gunfire of 'enemy' tanks, and
exhausted from hours of aiming a rifle at a target or throwing wooden
hand grenades.  I was expected to demonstrate my passion for, and my
excellence at, all these activities, at which I was hopeless.  It was
unforgivable for me to be good only at English, my subject.  These army
tasks were political assignments, and I had to prove myself in them.

Ironically, in the army itself, good marksmanship and other military
skills would lead to a soldier being condemned as 'white and expert."

I was one of the handful of students who threw the wooden hand grenades
such a dangerously short distance that we were banned from the grand
occasion of throwing the real thing.  As our pathetic group sat on the
top of a hill listening to the distant explosions, one girl burst into
sobs.  I felt deeply apprehensive too, at the thought of having given
apparent proof of being 'white."

Our second test was shooting.  As we marched onto the firing range, I
thought to myself: I cannot afford to fail this, I absolutely have to
pass.  When my name was called and I lay on the ground, gazing at the
target through the gunsight, I saw complete blackness.  No target, no
ground, nothing.  I was trembling so much my whole body felt powerless.
The order to fire sounded faint, as though it was floating from a great
distance through clouds.  I pulled the trigger, but I did not hear any
noise, or see anything.

When the results were checked, the instructors were p"7~led: none of my
ten bullets had even hit the board, let alone the target.

I could not believe it.  My eyesight was perfect.  I told the
instructor the gun barrel must be bent.  He seemed to believe me: the
result was too spectacularly bad to be entirely my fault.  I was given
another gun, provoking complaints from others who had asked,
unsuccessfully, for a second chance.  My second go was slightly better:
two of the ten bullets hit the outer rings.  Even so, my name was still
at the bottom of the whole university.  Seeing the results stuck on the
wall like a propaganda poster, I knew that my 'whiteness' was further
bleached.  I heard snide remarks from one student official: "Humph!
Getting a second chance!  As if that would do her any good!  If she has
no class feelings, or class hatred, a hundred goes won't save her!"

In my misery, I retreated into my own thoughts, and hardly noticed the
soldiers, young peasants in their early twenties, who instructed us.
Only one incident drew my attention to them.  One evening when some
girls collected their clothes from the line on which they had hung them
to dry, their knickers were unmistakably stained with semen.

In the university I found refuge in the homes of the professors and
lecturers who had obtained their jobs before the Cultural Revolution,
on academic merit.  Several of the professors had been to Britain or
the United States before the Communists took power, and I felt I could
relax and speak the same language with them.  Even so, they were
cautious.  Most intellectuals were, as the result of years of
repression.  We avoided dangerous topics.  Those who had been to the
West rarely talked about their time there.

Although I was dying to ask, I checked myself, not wanting to place
them in a difficult position.

Partly for the same reason, I never discussed my thoughts with my
parents.  How could they have responded with dangerous truths or safe
lies?  Besides, I did not want them to worry about my heretical ideas.
I wanted them to be genuinely in the dark, so that if anything happened
to me they could truthfully say they did not know.

The people to whom I did communicate my thoughts were friends of my own
generation.  Actually, there was little else to do except talk,
particularly with men friends.

To 'go out' with a man being seen alone together in public was
tantamount to an engagement.  There was still virtually no
entertainment to go to anyway.  Cinemas showed only the handful of
works approved by Mine Mao.

Occasionally a rare foreign movie, perhaps from Albania, would be
screened, but most of the tickets disappeared into the pockets of
people with connections.  A ferocious crowd would swamp the box office
and try to tear each other away from the window to get the remaining
few tickets.  Scalpers made a killing.

So, we just sat at home and talked.  We sat very properly,

as in Victorian England.  For women to have friendships with men was
unusual in those days, and a girlfriend once said to me, "I've never
known a girl who has so many men friends.  Girls normally have
girlfriends."  She was right.  I knew many girls who married the first
man who came near them.  From my own men friends, the only
demonstrations of interest I got were some rather sentimental poems and
restrained letters one of which, admittedly, was written in blood from
the goalkeeper on the college football team.

My friends and I often talked about the West.  By then I had come to
the conclusion that it was a wonderful place.

Paradoxically, the first people to put this idea into my head were Mao
and his regime.  For years, the things to which I was naturally
inclined had been condemned as evils of the West: pretty clothes,
flowers, books, entertainment, politeness, gentleness, spontaneity,
mercy, kindness, liberty, aversion to cruelty and violence, love
instead of 'class hatred," respect for human lives, the desire to be
left alone, professional competence .... As I sometimes wondered to
myself, how could anyone not desire the West.}

I was extremely curious about the alternatives to the kind of life I
had been leading, and my friends and I exchanged rumors and scraps of
information we dug from official publications.  I was struck less by
the West's technological developments and high living standards than by
the absence of political witch-hunts, the lack of consuming suspicion,
the dignity of the individual, and the incredible amount of liberty. To
me, the ultimate proof of freedom in the West was that there seemed to
be so many people there attacking the West and praising China. Almost
every other day the front page of Reference, the newspaper which carded
foreign press items, would feature some eulogy of Mao and the Cultural
Revolution.  At first I was angered by these, but they soon made me see
how tolerant another society could be.  I realized that this was the
kind of society I wanted to live in: where people were allowed to hold
different, even outrageous views.  I began to see that it was the very
tolerance of oppositions, of protesters, that kept the West
progressing.

Still, I could not help being irritated by some obser~'ations.  Once I
read an article by a Westerner who came to China to see some old
friends, university professors, who told him cheerfully how they had
enjoyed being denounced and sent to the back end of beyond, and how
much they had relished being reformed.  The author concluded that Mao
had indeed made the Chinese into 'new people' who would regard what was
misery to a Westerner as pleasure.

I was aghast.  Did he not know that repression was at its worst when
there was no complaint?  A hundred times more so when the victim
actually presented a smiling face?  Could he not see to what a pathetic
condition these professors had been reduced, and what horror must have
been involved to degrade them so?  I did not realize that the acting
that the Chinese were putting on was something to which Westerners were
unaccustomed, and which they could not always decode.

I did not appreciate either that information about China was not easily
available, or was largely misunderstood, in the West, and that people
with no experience of a regime like China's could take its propaganda
and rhetoric at face value.  As a result, I assumed that these eulogies
were dishonest.  My friends and I would joke that they had been bought
by our government's 'hospitality."  When foreigners were allowed into
certain restricted places in China following Nixon's visit, wherever
they went the authorities immediately cordoned off enclaves even within
these enclaves.  The best transport facilities, shops, restaurants,
guest houses and scenic spots were reserved for them, with signs
reading "For Foreign Guests Only."  Mao-tai, the most sought-after
liquor, was totally unavailable to ordinary Chinese, but freely
available to foreigners.  The best food was saved for foreigners.  The
newspapers proudly reported that Henry Kissinger had said his waistline
had expanded as a result of the many twelve-course banquets he
enjoyed

630 "Sniffing after Foreigners' Fans

during his visits to China.  This was at a time when in Sichuan,
"Heaven's Granary," our meat ration was half a pound per month, and the
streets of Chengdu were full of homeless peasants who had fled there
from famine in the north, and were living as beggars.  There was great
resentment among the population about how the foreigners were treated
like lords.  My friends and I began saying among ourselves: "Why do we
attack the Kuomintang for allowing signs saying "No Chinese or Dogs"
aren't we doing the same~'

Getting hold of information became an obsession.  I benefited
enormously from my ability to read English, as although the university
library had been looted during the Cultural Revolution, most of the
books it had lost had been in Chinese.  Its extensive English-language
collection had been turned upside down, but was still largely intact.

The librarians were delighted that these books were being read,
especially by a student, and were extremely helpful.  The index system
had been thrown into chaos, and they dug through piles of books to find
the ones I wanted.  It was through the efforts of these kind young men
and women that I laid my hands on some English classics.

Louisa May Alcott's Little Women was the first novel I read in English.
I found women writers like her, Jane Austen, and the Bronti~ sisters
much easier to read than male authors like Dickens, and I also felt
more empathy with their characters.  I read a brief history of European
and American literature, and was enormously impressed by the Greek
tradition of democracy, Renaissance humanism, and the Enlightenment's
questioning of everything.  When I read in Gulliver's Travels about the
emperor who 'published an Edict, commanding all his Subjects, upon
great Penalties, to break the smaller End of their Eggs," I wondered if
Swift had been to China.  My joy at the sensation of my mind opening up
and expanding was beyond description.

Being alone in the library was heaven for me.  My heart would leap as I
approached it, usually at dusk, anticipating

Learning English in Mao's P~ake 63 i the pleasure of solitude with my
books, the outside world ceasing to exist.  As I hurried up the flight
of stairs, into the pastiche classical-style building, the smell of old
books long stored in airless rooms would give me tremors of excitement,
and I would hate the stairs for being too long.

With the help of dictionaries which some professors lent me, I became
acquainted with Longfellow, Wait Whitman, and American history.  I
memorized the whole of the Declaration of Independence, and my heart
swelled at the words "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all
men are created equal," and those about men's 'unalienable Rights,"
among them "Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."  These concepts were
unheard of in China, and opened up a marvelous new world for me.  My
notebooks, which I kept with me at all times, were full of passages
like these, passionately and tearfully copied out.

One autumn day in 1974, with an air of extreme secrecy, a friend of
mine showed me a copy of Newsweek with pictures of Mao and Mme Mao in
it.  She could not read English, and was keen to know what the article
said.  This was the first genuine foreign magazine I had ever set eyes
on.  One sentence in the article struck me like a flash of lightning.
It said that Mme Mao was Mao's 'eyes, ears, and voice."  Up fill that
moment, I had never allowed myself to contemplate the obvious
connection between Mme Mao's deeds and her husband.  But now Mao's name
was spelled out for me.  My blurred perceptions surrounding his image
came sharply into focus.  It was Mao who had been behind the
destruction and suffering.  Without him, Mme Mao and her second-rate
coterie could not have lasted a single day.  I experienced the thrill
of challenging Mao openly in my mind for the first time.

27.  "If Thb Is Paradise, What Then Is Hell?  "The Death of My Father

(1974-1970)

All this time, unlike most of his former colleagues, my father had not
been rehabilitated or given a job.  He had been sitting at home in
Meteorite Street doing nothing since he came back from Peking with my
mother and me in autumn 197z.  The problem was that he had criticized
Mao by name.  The team investigating him was sympathetic and tried to
ascribe some of what he had said against Mao to his mental illness. But
the team came up against fierce opposition amongst the higher
authorities, who wanted to give him a severe condemnation.  Many of my
father's colleagues sympathized with him and indeed admired him.

But they had to think about their own necks.  Besides, my father did
not belong to any clique and had no powerful patron which might have
helped get him cleared.  Instead, he had well-placed enemies.

One day back in 1968, my mother, who was briefly out from detention,
saw an old friend of my father's at a roadside food stall.  This man
had thrown in his lot with the Tings.  He was with his wife, who had
actually been introduced to him by my mother and Mrs.  Ting when they
were working together in Yibin.  In spite of the couple's obvious
reluctance to have anything to do with her beyond a brief nod, my
mother marched up to their table and joined them.

She asked them to appeal to the Tings to spare my father.

After hearing my mother out, the man shook his head and said, "It's not
so simple .... Then he dipped a finger into his tea and wrote the
character Zuo on the table.  He gave my mother a meaningful look, got
up with his wife, and left without another word.

Zuo was a former close colleague of my father's, and was one of the few
senior officials who did not suffer at all in the Cultural Revolution.
He became the darling of Mrs.  Shau's Rebels and a friend of the Tings,
but survived their demise and that of L'm Biao and remained in power.

My father would not withdraw his words against Mao.

But when the team investigating him suggested putting them down to his
mental illness, he acquiesced, with great anguish.

Meanwhile, the general situation made him despondent.

There were no principles governing either the behavior of the people or
the conduct of the Party.  Corruption began to come back in a big way.
Officials looked after their families and friends first.  For fear of
being beaten up, teachers gave all pupils top marks irrespective of the
quality of their work, and bus conductors would not collect fares.

Dedication to public good was openly sneered at.  Mao's Cultural
Revolution had destroyed both Party discipline and civic morality.

My father found it difficult to control himself so that he would not
speak his mind and say things that would incriminate him and his family
further.

He had to rely on tranquilizers.  When the political climate was more
relaxed, he took less; when the campaigns intensified, he took more.
Every time the psychiatrists renewed his supply, they shook their
heads, saying it was extremely dangerous for him to continue taking
such large

634 "If This Is Paradise, What Then Is Hell?"

doses.  But he could only manage short periods off the pills.

In May 1974 he sensed that he was on the verge of a breakdown, and
asked to be given psychiatric treatment.

This time he was hospitalized swiftly, thanks to his former colleagues
who were now back in charge of the health service.

I got leave from the university and went to stay with him in the
hospital to keep him company.  Dr.  Su, the psychiatrist who had
treated him before, was looking after him again.  Under the Tings, Dr.
Su had been condemned for giving a true diagnosis about my father, and
had been ordered to write a confession saying my father had been faking
madness.  He refused, for which he was subjected to denunciation
meetings, beaten up, and thrown out of the medical profession.  I saw
him one day in 1968, emptying rubbish bins and cleaning the hospital
spittoons.  His hair had turned gray, though he was only in his
thirties.  After the downfall of the Tings he was rehabilitated.  He
was very friendly to my father and me, as were all the doctors and
nurses.  They told me they would take good care of my father, and that
I did not have to stay with him.  But I wanted to.  I thought he needed
love more than anything else.  And I was anxious about what might
happen if he fell down with no one around.  His blood pressure was
dangerously high, and he had already had several minor heart attacks,
which had left him with a walking impediment.  He looked as though he
might slip at any time.

Doctors warned that a fall could be fatal.  I moved into the men's ward
with him, into the same room he had occupied in summer 1967.  Each room
could accommodate two patients, but my father had the room to himself,
and I slept in the spare bed.

I was with him every moment in case he fell over.  When he went to the
toilet, I waited outside.  If he stayed in there for what I thought was
too long, I would start to imagine he had had a heart attack, and would
make a fool of myself by calling out to him.  Every day I took long
walks with him in the back garden, which was full of other psychiatric
patients in gray-striped pajamas walking incessantly, with spiritless
eyes.  The sight of them always made me scared and intensely sad.

The garden itself was full of vivid colors.  White butterflies
fluttered among yellow dandelions on the lawn.  In the surrounding
flowerbeds were a Chinese aspen, graceful swaying bamboos, and a few
garnet flowers of pomegranates behind a thicket of oleanders.  As we
walked, I composed my poems.

At one end of the garden was a large entertainment room where the
inmates went to play cards and chess and to flip through the few
newspapers and sanctioned books.

One nurse told me that earlier in the Cultural Revolution the room had
been used for the inmates to study Chairman Mao's works because his
nephew, Mao Yuanxin, had 'discovered' that Mao's Litfie Red Book,
rather than medical treatment, was the cure for mental patients.  The
study sessions did not last long, the nurse told me, because 'whenever
a patient opened his mouth, we were all scared to death.  Who knew what
he was going to say?"

The patients were not violent, as their treatment had sapped their
physical and mental vitality.  Even so, living among them was
frightening, particularly at night, when my father's pills had sent him
into a sound sleep and the whole building had become quiet.  Like all
the rooms, ours had no lock, and several times I woke with a start to
find a man standing by my bed, holding the mosquito net open and
staring at me with the intensity of the insane.  I would break into a
cold sweat and pull up the quilt to stifle a scream: the last thing I
wanted was to wake my father sleep was vital to his recovery.
Eventually, the patient would shuffle away.

After a month, my father went home.  But he was not completely cured
his mind had been under too much pressure for too long, and the
political environment was still too repressive for him to relax.  He
had to keep taking tranquilizers.  There was nothing the psychiatrists
could do.  His nervous system was wearing out, and so were his body and
mind.

Eventually, a draft verdict on him was drawn up by the team
investigating him.  It said that he had 'committed serious political
errors' which was one step away from behind labeled a 'class enemy." In
line with Party regulations, the draft verdict was given to my father
to sign as confirmation that he accepted it.  When he read it, he
wept.

But he signed.

The verdict was not accepted by the higher authorities.

They wanted a harsher one.

In March 1975, my brother-in-law Specs was up for promotion in his
factory, and the personnel officers of the factory came to my father's
depa~UHent for the obligatory political investigation.  A former Rebel
from Mrs.  Shau's group received the visitors and told them my father
was 'anti-Mao."  Specs did not get his promotion.  He did not mention
it to my parents for fear of upsetting them, but a friend from my
father's department came to the house and my father overheard him
whispering the news to my mother.  The pain he showed was harrowing
when he apologized to Specs for jeopardizing his future.  In tears of
despair he said to my mother, "What have I done for even my son-in-law
to be dragged down like this?  What do I have to do to save you?"

In spite of taking a large number of tranquilizers, my father hardly
slept over the following days and nights.  On the afternoon of 9 April
he said he was going to have a nap.

When my mother finished cooking supper in our small ground-floor
kitchen, she thought she would leave him to sleep a little longer.
Eventually she went upstairs to the bedroom and found she could not
wake him.  She realized he had had a heart attack.  We had no
telephone, so she rushed to the provincial government clinic one street
away and found its head, Dr.  Jen.

The Death o My Father 637 DrJen was extremely able, and before the
Cultural Revolution he had been in charge of the health of the elite in
the compound.  He had often come to our apartment, and would discuss
the health of all my family, with great concern.  But when the Cultural
Revolution started and we were out of favor, he became cold and
disdainful toward us.  I saw many people like DrJen, and their behavior
never ceased to shock me.

When my mother found him, Dr.  Jen was clearly irritated, and said he
would come when he had finished what he was doing.  She told him a
heart attack could not wait, but he looked at her as if to say that
impatience would not help her.  It was an hour before he deigned to
come to our house with a nurse, but without any first-aid equipment.

The nurse had to walk back to fetch it.  Dr.  Jen turned Father over a
few times, and then just sat and waited.

Another half an hour passed, by which time my father was dead.

That night I was in my dormitory at the university, working by
candlelight during one of the frequent blackouts.

Some people from my father's department arrived and drove me home
without explanation.

Father lay sideways in his bed, his face unusually peaceful, as though
he had gone to a restful sleep.  He no longer looked senescent, but
youthful, even younger than his age of fifty-four.  I felt as if my
heart was torn into fragments, and I wept uncontrollably.

For days I wept in silence.  I thought of my father's life, his wasted
dedication and crushed dreams.  He need not have died.  Yet his death
seemed so inevitable.  There was no place for him in Mao's China,
because he had tried to be an honest man.  He had been betrayed by
something to which he had given his whole life, and the betrayal had
destroyed him.

My mother demanded that DrJen be punished.  If it had not been for his
negligence, my father might not have died.

Her request was dismissed as a 'widow's emotionalism."

She decided not to pursue the matter.  She wanted to concentrate on a
more important battle: getting an acceptable memorial speech for my
father.

This speech was extremely important, because it would be understood by
everyone to be the Party's assessment of my father.  It would be put
into his personal file and continue to determine his children's future,
even though he was dead.  There were set patterns and fixed
formulations for such a speech.  Any deviation from the standard
expressions used for an official who had been cleared would be
interpreted as the Party having reservations about, or condemning, the
dead person.  A draft speech was drawn up and shown to my mother.  It
was full of damning deviations.  My mother knew that with this
valedictory my family would never be free of suspicion.  At best we
would live in a state of permanent insecurity; more likely, we would be
discriminated against for generation after generation.  She turned down
several drafts.

The odds were heavily against her, but she knew that there was a lot of
sympathy for my father.  This was the traditional time for a Chinese
family to engage in a bit of emotional blackmail.  After my father's
death she had had a collapse, but she ban led with undiminished
determination from her sickbed.  She threatened to denounce the
authorities at the memorial service if she did not get an acceptable
valedictory.  She summoned my father's friends and colleagues to her
bedside, and told them she was putting the future of her children in
their hands.  They promised to speak up for my father.  In the end, the
authorities relented.

Although no one yet dared to treat him as rehabilitated, the assessment
was modified to one that was fairly innocuous.

The service was held on 21 April.  Following the standard practice, it
was organized by a 'funeral committee' of my father's former
colleagues, including people who had helped to persecute him, like Zuo.
It was carefully staged down to the last detail, and was attended by
about 500 people, according to the prescribed formula.  These were
apportioned between the several dozen departments and bureaus of the
provincial government and the offices that came under my father's
department.  Even the odious Mrs.  Shau was there.  Each organization
was asked to send a wreath, made of paper flowers, the size of which
was specified.  In a way, my family welcomed the fact that the occasion
was official.  A private ceremony was unheard of for someone of my
father's position, and would be taken as a repudiation by the Party.  I
did not recognize most of the people there, but all my close friends
who knew about my father's death came, including Plumpie, Nana, and the
electricians from my old factory.  My classmates from Sichuan
University came as well, including the student official Ming.  My old
friend Bing, whom I had refused to see after my grandmother's death,
turned up and our friendship immediately picked up where it had left
off six years before.

The ritual prescribed that one 'representative of the family of the
deceased' should speak, and this role fell to me.  I recalled my
father's character, his moral principles, his faith in his Party, and
his passionate dedication to the people.  I hoped that the tragedy of
his death would leave the participants with plenty to mull over.

At the end, when everyone filed past and shook hands with us, I saw
tears on the faces of many former Rebels.

Even Mrs.  Shall looked lugubrious.  They had a mask for every
occasion.  Some of the Rebels murmured to me, "We are all very sorry
about what your father went through."

Maybe they were.  But what difference did that make?  My father was
dead and they had had a big hand in killing him.  Would they do the
same thing to somebody else in the next campaign, I wondered.

A young woman I did not know laid her head on my shoulder and sobbed
violently.  I felt a note being tucked into my hand.  I read it
afterward.  On it was scribbled: "I was deeply moved by the character
of your father.  We must learn from him and be worthy successors to the
cause he has left behind the great proletarian revolutionary cause."

Did my speech really give rise to this, I pondered.  It seemed there
was no escape from the Communists' appropriation of moral principles
and noble sentiments.

Some weeks before my father's death, I had been sitting in the Chengdu
railway station with him waiting for a friend of his to arrive.  We
were in the same half-open waiting area where my mother and I had sat
nearly a decade before when she was going to Peking to appeal for him.
The waiting area had not changed much, except that it looked shabbier,
and was much more crowded.  Still more people thronged the large square
out in front.  Some were sleeping there, some just sitting, others
breast-feeding their babies;

quite a few were begging.  These were peasants from the north, where
there was a local famine the result of bad weather and, in some cases,
sabotage by Mme Mao's coterie.  They had come down on trains, crammed
onto the roofs of the carriages.  There were many stories about people
being swept off, or decapitated going through tunnels.

On our way to the station, I had asked my father if I could go down the
Yangtze during the summer vacation.

"The priority in my life," I had declared, 'is to have fun."

He had shaken his head disapprovingly.

"When you are young, you should make your priority study and work."

I brought up the subject again in the waiting area.  A cleaner was
sweeping the ground.  At one point her path was par fly blocked by a
northern peasant woman who was sitting on the cement floor with a
tattered bundle next to her and two toddlers in rags.  A third child
was suckling her breast, which she had bared without a trace of
shyness, and which was black with dirt.  The cleaner swept the dust
right over them, as though they were not there.  The peasant woman did
not move a muscle.

My father turned to me and said, "With people living like this all
around you, how can you possibly have fun?"  I was silent.  I did not
say, "But what can I, a mere individual, do?  Must I live miserably for
nothing?"  That would have sounded shockingly selfish.  I had been
brought up in the tradition of 'regarding the interest of the whole
nation as my own duty' (yi tian-xia wei fi-ren).

Now, in the emptiness I felt after my father's death, I began to
question all such precepts.  I wanted no grand mission, no 'causes,"
just a life a quiet, perhaps a frivolous life of my own.  I told my
mother that when the summer vacation came I wanted to travel down the
Yangtze.

She urged me to go.  So did my sister, who, along with Specs, had been
living with my family since she had returned to Chengdu.  Specs's
factory, which should normally have been responsible for providing him
with housing, had built no new apartments during the Cultural
Revolution.  Then many employees, like Specs, had been single, and
lived in dormitories eight to a room.  Now, ten years later, most of
them were married and had children.

There was nowhere for them to live, so they had to stay with their
parents or parents-in-law, and it was commonplace for three generations
to live in one room.

My sister had not been given a job, as the fact that she had got
married before she had a job in the city excluded her from employment.
Now, thanks to a regulation which said that when a state employee died
one of their offspring could take their place, my sister was given a
post in the administration of the Chengdu College of Chinese
Medicine.

In July I set off on my journey with Jin-ming, who was studying in
Wuhan, a big city on the Yangtze.  Our first stop was the nearby
mountain of Lushan, which had luxuriant vegetation and an excellent
climate.  Important Party conferences had been held there, including
the one in 1959 at which Marshal Peng Dehuai was denounced, and the
site was designated as a place of interest 'for people to receive a
revolutionary education."  When I suggested going there to have a look,
Jin-ming said incredulously, "You don't want a break from
"revolutionary education"?"

We took a lot of photographs on the mountain, and had finished a whole
roll of thirty-six exposures except for one.

On our way down, we passed a two-story villa, hidden in a thicket of
Chinese parasol trees, magnolia, and pines.  It looked almost like a
random pile of stones against the background of the rocks.  It struck
me as an unusually lovely place, and I snapped my last shot.  Suddenly
a man materialized out of nowhere and asked me in a low but commanding
voice to hand over my camera.  He wore civilian clothes, but I noticed
he had a pistol.  He opened the camera and exposed my entire roll of
film.  Then he disappeared, as if into the earth.  Some tourists
standing next to me whispered that this was one of Mao's summer villas.
I felt another pang of revulsion toward Mao, not so much for his
privilege, but for the hypocrisy of allowing himself luxury while
telling his people that even comfort was bad for them.  After we were
safely out of earshot of the invisible guard, and I was bemoaning the
loss of my thirty-six pictures, Jin-ming gave me a grin: "See where
goggling at holy places gets you!"

We left Lushan by bus.  Like every bus in China, it was packed, and we
had to crane our necks desperately trying to breathe.  Virtually no new
buses had been built since the beginning of the Cultural Revolution,
during which time the urban population had increased by several tens of
millions.  After a few minutes, we suddenly stopped.  The front door
was forced open, and an authoritative-looking man in plainclothes
squeezed in.

"Get down!  Get down!"  he barked.

"Some American guests are coming this way.  It is harmful to the
prestige of our motherland for them to see all these messy heads!"  We
tried to crouch down, but the bus was too crowded.  The man shouted,
"It is the duty of everyone to safeguard the honor of our motherland!
We must present an orderly and dignified appearance!  Get down!  Bend
your knees!"

Suddenly I heard Jin-ming's booming voice: "Doesn'T Chairman Mao
instruct us never to bend our knees to American imperialists?"  This
was asking for trouble.

Humor was not appreciated.  The man shot a stern glance in our
direction, but said nothing.  He gave the bus another quick scan, and
hurried off.  He did not want the "American guests' to witness a scene.
Any sign of discord had to be hidden from foreigners.

Wherever we went as we traveled down the Yangtze we saw the aftermath
of the Cultural Revolution: temples smashed, statues toppled, and old
towns wrecked.  Litfie evidence remained of China's ancient
civilization.  But the loss went even deeper than this.  Not only had
China destroyed most of its beautiful things, it had lost its
appreciation of them, and was unable to make new ones.  Except for the
much-scarred but still stunning landscape, China had become an ugly
country.

At the end of the vacation, I took a steamer alone from Wuhan back up
through the Yangtze Gorges.  The journey took three days.  One morning,
as I was leaning over the side, a gust of wind blew my hair loose and
my hairpin fell into the river.  A passenger with whom I had been
chatting pointed to a tributary which joined the Yangtze just where we
were passing, and told me a story.

In 33 ~c, the emperor of China, in an attempt to appease the country's
powerful northern neighbors, the Huns, decided to send a woman to marry
the barbarian king.  He made his selection from the portraits of the
3,000 concubines in his court, many of whom he had never seen.  As she
was for a barbarian, he selected the ugliest portrait, but on the day
of her departure he discovered that the woman was in fact extremely
beautiful.  Her portrait was ugly because she had refused to bribe the
court painter.

The emperor ordered the artist to be executed, while the lady wept,
sitting by a river, at having to leave her country to live among the
barbarians.  The wind carried away her hairpin and dropped it into the
river as though it wanted to keep something of hers in her homeland.
Later on, she killed herself.

Legend had it that where her hairpin dropped, the river turned crystal
clear, and became known as the Crystal

River.  My fellow passenger told me this was the tributary we were
passing.  With a grin, he declared: "Ah, bad omen!

You might end up living in a foreign land and marrying a barbarian!"  I
smiled faintly at the traditional Chinese obsession about other races
being 'barbarians," and wondered whether this lady of antiquity might
not actually have been better off marrying the 'barbarian' king.  She
would at least be in daily contact with the grassland, the horses, and
nature.  With the Chinese emperor, she was living in a luxurious
prison, without even a proper tree, which might enable the concubines
to climb a wall and escape.  I thought how we were like the frogs at
the bottom of the well in the

Chinese legend, who claimed that the sky was only as big as the round
opening at the top of their well.  I felt an intense and urgent desire
to see the world.

At the time I had never spoken with a foreigner, even though I was
twenty-three, and had been an Englishlanguage student for nearly two
years.  The only foreignersI had ever even set eyes on had been in
Peking in 1972.

A foreigner, one of the few 'friends of China," had come to my
university once.  It was a hot summer day and I was having a nap when a
fellow student burst into our room and woke us all by shrieking: "A
foreigner is here!  Let's go and look at the foreigner!"  Some of the
others went, but I decided to stay and continue my snooze.  I found the
whole idea of gazing, zombie like rather ridiculous.  Anyway, what was
the point of staring if we were forbidden to open our mouths to him,
even though he was a 'friend of China'?

I had never even heard a foreigner speaking, except on one single
Linguaphone record.  When I started learning the language, I had
borrowed the record and a phonograph, and listened to it at home in
Meteorite Street.  Some neighbors gathered in the courtyard, and said
with their eyes wide open and their heads shaking, "What funny
sounds!"

They asked me to play the record over and over again.

Speaking to a foreigner was the dream of every student, and my
opportunity came at last.  When I got back from my trip down the
Yangtze, I learned that my year was being sent in October to a port in
the south called Zhanjiang to practice our English with foreign
sailors.  I was thrilled.

Zhanjiang was about 75 miles from Chengdu, a journey of two days and
two nights by rail.  It was the southernmost large port in China, and
quite near the Vietnamese border.

It felt like a foreign country, with turn-of-the-century colonial-style
buildings, pastiche Romanesque arches, rose windows, and large verandas
with colorful parasols.  The local people spoke Cantonese, which was
almost a foreign language.  The air smelled of the unfamiliar sea,
exotic tropical vegetation, and an altogether bigger world.

But my excitement at being there was constantly doused by frustration.
We were accompanied by a political supervisor and three lecturers, who
decided that, although we were staying only a mile from the sea, we
were not to be allowed anywhere near it.  The harbor itself was closed
to outsiders, for fear of 'sabotage' or defection.  We were told that a
student from Guangzhou had managed to stow away once in a cargo
steamer, not realizing that the hold would be sealed for weeks, by
which time he had perished.  We had to restrict our movements to a
clearly defined area of a few blocks around our residence.

Regulations like these were part of our daily life, but they never
failed to infuriate me.  One day I was seized by an absolute compulsion
to get out.  I faked illness and got permission to go to a hospital in
the middle of the city.  I wandered the streets desperately trying to
spot the sea, without success.  The local people were unhelpful: they
did not like non-Cantonese speakers, and refused to understand me.  We
stayed in the port for three weeks, and only once were we allowed, as a
special treat, to go to an island to see the ocean.

As the point of being there was to talk to the sailors, we were
organized into small groups to take turns working in the two places
they were allowed to frequent: the Friendship Store, which sold goods
for hard currency, and the Sailors' Club, which had a bar, a
restaurant, a billiards room, and a ping-pong room.

There were strict rules about how we could talk to the sailors.  We
were not allowed to speak to them alone, except for brief exchanges
over the counter of the Friendship Store.  If we were asked our names
and addresses, under no circumstances were we to give our real ones. We
all prepared a false name and a nonexistent address.  After every
conversation, we had to write a detailed report of what had been said
which was standard practice for anyone who had contact with foreigners.
We were warned over and over again about the importance of observing
'discipline in foreign contacts' (she waifi-lu).  Otherwise, we were
told, not only would we get into serious trouble, other students would
be banned from coming.

Actually, our opportunities for practising English were few and far
between.  The ships did not come every day, and not all sailors came on
shore.  Most of the sailors were not native English speakers: there
were Greeks, Japanese, Yugoslavs, Africans, and many Filipinos, most of
whom spoke only a little English, although there was also a Scottish
captain and his wife, as well as some Scandinavians whose English was
excellent.

While we waited in the club for our precious sailors, I often sat on
the veranda at the back, reading and gazing at the groves of coconut
and palm trees, silhouetted against a sapphire-blue sky.  The moment
the sailors sauntered in, we would leap up and virtually grab them,
while trying to appear as dignified as possible, so eager were we to
engage them in conversation.  I often saw a pn7~led look in their eyes
when we declined their offers of a drink.  We were forbidden to accept
drinks from them.  In fact, we were not allowed to drink at all: the
fancy foreign bottles and cans

The Death of,~y leather 647 on display were exclusively for the
foreigners.  We just sat there, four or five infimidatingly
serious-looking young men and women.  I had no idea how odd it must
have seemed to the sailors and how far from their expectations of port
life.

When the first black sailors arrived, our teachers gently warned the
women students to watch out: "They are less developed and haven't
learned to control their instincts, so they are given to displaying
their feelings whenever they like: touching, embracing, even kissing."
To a roomful of shocked and disgusted faces, our teachers told us that
one woman in the last group had burst out screaming in the middle of a
conversation when a Gambian sailor had tried to hug her.  She thought
she was going to be raped (in the middle of a crowd, a Chinese crowd!),
and was so scared that she could not bring herself to talk to another
foreigner for the rest of her stay.

The male students, particularly the student officials, assumed
responsibility for safeguarding us women.  Whenever a black sailor
started talking to one of us, they would eye each other and hurry to
our rescue by taking over the conversation and positioning themselves
between us and the sailors.  Their precautions may not have been
noticed by the black sailors, especially as the students would
immediately start talking about 'the friendship between China and the
peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America."

"China is a developing country," they would intone, reciting from our
textbook, 'and will stand forever by the side of the oppressed and
exploited masses in the third world in their struggle against the
American imperialists and the Soviet revisionists."  The blacks would
look baffled but touched.  Sometimes they embraced the Chinese men, who
returned comradely hugs.

Much was being made by the regime about China being one of the
developing countries, part of the third world, according to Mao's
'glorious theory."  But Mao made it sound as if this was not the
acknowledgment of a fact, but that China was magnanimously lowering
itself to their level.  The way he said it left no doubt that we had
joined the ranks of the third world in order to lead it and protect it,
and the world regarded our rightful place to be somewhat grander.

I was extremely irritated by this self-styled superiority.

What had we got to be superior about?  Our population?

Our size?  In Zhanjiang, I saw that the third world sailors, with their
flashy watches, cameras, and drinks none of which we had ever seen
before were immeasurably better off, and incomparably freer, than all
but a very few Chinese.

I was terribly curious about foreigners, and was eager to discover what
they were really like.  How similar to the Chinese were they, and how
different?  But I had to try to conceal my inquisitiveness which, apart
from being politically dangerous, would be regarded as losing face.
Under Mao, as in the days of the Middle Kingdom, the Chinese placed
great importance on holding themselves with 'dignity' in front of
foreigners, by which was meant appearing aloof, or inscrutable.  A
common form this took was to show no interest in the outside world, and
many of my fellow students never asked any questions.

Perhaps partly due to my uncontrollable curiosity, and partly due to my
better English, the sailors all seemed keen to talk to me in spite of
the fact that I took care to speak as little as possible so that my
fellow students had more chance to practice.  Some sailors would even
refuse to talk to the other students.  I was also very popular with the
director of the Sailors' Club, an enormous, burly man called Long. This
aroused the ire of Ming and some of the minders.  Our political
meetings now included an examination of how we were observing 'the
disciplines in foreign contact."  It was stated that I had violated
these because my eyes looked 'too interested," I 'smiled too often,"
and when I did so I opened my mouth 'too wide."  I was also criticized
for using hand gestures:

we women students were supposed to keep our hands under the table and
sit motionless.

Much of Chinese societ)' still expected its women to hold themselves in
a sedate manner, lower their eyelids in response to men's stares, and
restrict their smile to a faint curve of the lips which did not expose
their teeth.  They were not meant to use hand gestures at all.  If they
contravened any of these canons of behavior they would be considered
'flirtatious."  Under Mao, flirting with./bre/gners was an unspeakable
crime.

I was furious at the innuendo against me.  It had been my Communist
parents who had given me a liberal upbringing.

They had regarded the restrictions on women as precisely the sort of
thing a Communist revolution should put an end to.  But now oppression
of women joined hands with political repression, and served resentment
and petty jealousy.

One day, a Pakistani ship arrived.  The Pakistani military attache came
down from Peking.  Long ordered us all to spring-clean the club from
top to bottom, and laid on a banquet, for which he asked me to be his
interpreter, which made some of the other students extremely envious. A
few days later the Pakistanis gave a farewell dinner on their ship, and
I was invited.  The military attache had been to Sichuan, and they had
prepared a special Sichuan dish for me.  Long was delighted by the
invitation, as was I. But despite a personal appeal from the captain
and even a threat from Long to bar future students, my teachers said
that no one was allowed on board a foreign ship.

"Who would take the responsibility if someone sailed away on the ship?"
they asked.  I was told to say I was busy that evening.

As far as I knew, I was turning down the only chance I would ever have
of a trip out to sea, a foreign meal, a proper conversation in English,
and an experience of the outside world.

Even so, I could not silence the whispers.  Ming asked pointedly, "Why
do foreigners like her so much?"  as though

65o "If This Is Paradise, What Then Is Hell?"

there was something suspicious in that.  The report filed on me at the
end of the trip said my behavior was 'politically dubious."

In this lovely port, with its sunshine, sea breezes, and coconut trees,
every occasion that should have been joyous was turned into misery.  I
had a good friend in the group who tried to cheer me up by putting my
distress into perspective.  Of course, what I encountered was no more
than minor unpleasantness compared with what victims of jealousy
suffered in the earlier years of the Cultural Revolution.  But the
thought that this was what my life at its best would be like depressed
me even more.

This friend was the son of a colleague of my father's.

The other students from cities were also friendly to me.  It was easy
to distinguish them from the students of peasant backgrounds, who
provided most of the student officials.

The city students were much more secure and confident when confronted
with the novel world of the port and they therefore did not feel the
same anxiety and the urge to be aggressive toward me.  Zhanjiang was a
severe culture shock to the former peasants, and their feelings of
inferiority were at the core of their compulsion to make life a misery
for others.

After three weeks, I was both sorry and relieved to say goodbye to
Zhanjiang.  On the way back to Chengdu, some friends and I went to the
legendary Guilin, where the mountains and waters looked as though they
had sprung from a classical Chinese painting.  There were foreign
tourists there, and we saw one couple with a baby in the man's arms. We
smiled at each other, and said "Good morning' and "Goodbye."  As soon
as they disappeared, a plainclothes policeman stopped us and questioned
us.

I returned to Chengdu in December, to find the city seething with
emotion against Mme Mao and three men from Shanghai, Zhang Chunqiao,
Yao Wenyuan, and Wang Hongwen, who had banded together to hold the fort
of the Cultural Revolution.  They had become so close that

The Death of My Father 65 I Mao had warned them against forming a "Gang
of Four' in July 1974, although we did not know this at the time.

By now the eighty-one-year-old Mao had begun to give them his full
backing, having had enough of the pragmatic approach of Zhou Enlai and
then of Deng Xiaoping, who had been running the day-to-day work of the
government since January 1975, when Zhou had gone into a hospital with
cancer.  The Gang's endless and pointless mini-campaigns had driven the
population to the end of their tether, and people had started
circulating rumors privately, as almost the only outlet for their
intense frustration.

Highly charged speculation was particularly directed against Mine Mao.
Since she was frequently seen together with one particular opera actor,
one ping-pong player, and one ballet dancer, each of whom had been
promoted by her to head their fields, and since they all happened to be
handsome young men, people said she had taken them as 'male
concubines," something she had openly and airily said women should do.
But everyone knew this did not apply to the general public.  In fact,
it was under Mme Mao in the Cultural Revolution that the Chinese
suffered extreme sexual repression.  With her controlling the media and
the arts for nearly ten years, any reference to love was deleted from
the hearing and sight of the population.  When a Vietnamese army
song-and-dance troupe came to China, those few who were lucky enough to
see it were told by the announcer that a song which mentioned love 'is
about the comradely affection between two comrades."  In the few
European films which were allowed mainly from Albania and Romania all
scenes of men and women standing close to each other, let alone
kissing, were cut out.

Frequently in crowded buses, trains, and shops I would hear women
yelling abuse at men and slapping their faces.

Sometimes the man would shout a denial and an exchange of insults would
ensue.  I experienced many attempted molestations.  When it happened, I
would just sneak away from the trembling hands or knees.  I felt sorry
for these men.

They lived in a world where there could be no outlet for their
sexuality unless they were lucky enough to have a happy marriage, the
chances of which were slim.  The deputy Party secretary of my
university, an elderly man, was caught in a department store with sperm
oozing through his trousers.  The crowds had pressed him against a
woman in front of him.  He was taken to the police station, and
subsequently expelled from the Party.  Women had just as tough a time.
In every organization, one or two of them would be condemned as
'worn-out shoes' for having had extramarital affairs.

These standards were not applied to the rulers.  The octogenarian Mao
surrounded himself with pretty young women.  Although the stories about
him were whispered and cautious, those about his wife and her cronies,
the Gang of Four, were open and uninhibited.  By the end of 1975, China
was boiling with incensed rumors.  In the mini-campaign called "Our
Socialist Motherland Is Paradise," many openly hinted at the question
which I had asked myself for the first time eight years before: "If
this is paradise, what then is hell?"

On 8 January 1976, Premier Zhou Enlai died.  To me and many other
Chinese, Zhou had represented a comparatively sane and liberal
government that believed in making the country work.  In the dark years
of the Cultural Revolution, Zhou was our meager hope.  I was
griefstricken at his death, as were all my friends.  Our mourning for
him and our loathing of the Cultural Revolution and of Mao and his
coterie became inseparably interwoven.

But Zhou had collaborated with Mao in the Cultural Revolution.  It was
he who delivered the denunciation of Liu Shaoqi as an "American spy."
He met almost daily with the Red Guards and the Rebels and issued
orders to them.

When a majority of the Politburo and the country's marsh Ms tried to
put a halt to the Cultural Revolution in February 1967 Zhou did not
give them his support.  He was Mao's faithful servant.  But perhaps he
had acted as he did

The Death of Mr.  Father 053 in order to prevent an even more
horrendous disaster, like a civil war, which an open challenge to Mao
could have brought on.  By keeping China running, he made it possible
for Mao to wreak havoc on it, but probably also saved the country from
total collapse.  He protected a number of people as far as he judged
safe, including, for a time, m?

father, as well as some of China's most important cultural monuments.
It seemed that he had been caught up in an insoluble moral dilemma,
although this does not exclude the possibility that survival was his
priority.  He must have known that if he had tried to stand up to Mao,
he would have been crushed.

The campus became a spectacular sea of white paper wreaths and mourning
posters and couplets.  Everyone wore a black arm band a white paper
flower on their chest, and a sorrowful expression.  The mourning was
par fly spontaneous and partly organized.  Because it was generally
known that at the time of his death Zhou had been under attack from the
Gang of Four, and because the Gang had ordered the mourning for him to
be played down, showing grief at his death was a way for both the
general public and the local authorities to show their disapproval of
the Gang.

But there were many who mourned Zhou for very different reasons.  Ming
and other student officials from my course extolled Zhou's alleged
contribution to 'suppressing the counterrevolutionary Hungarian
uprising in 1956," his hand in establishing Mao's prestige as a world
leader, and his absolute loyalty to Mao.

Outside the campus, there were more encouraging sparks of dissent.  In
the streets of Chengdu, graffiti appeared on the margins of the wall
posters and large crowds gathered, craning their necks to read the tiny
handwriting.  One poster read,

The sky is now dark, A great star is fallen... Scribbled in the margin
were the words: "How could the sky be dark: what about "the red, red
sun"?"  (meaning Mao).  Another graffito appeared on a wall slogan
reading "Deep-fry the persecutors of Premier Zhou!"  It said: "Your
monthly ration of cooking oil is only two liang [3.2 ounces].  What
would you use to fry these persecutors with?"  For the first time in
ten years, I saw irony and humor publicly displayed, which sent my
spirits soaring.

Mao appointed an ineffectual nobody called Hua Guofeng to succeed Zhou,
and launched a campaign to 'denounce Deng and hit back against a
right-wing comeback."  The Gang of Four published Deng Xiaoping's
speeches as targets for denunciation.  In one speech in 1975, Deng had
admitted that peasants in Yan'an were worse off than when the
Communists first arrived there after the Long March forty years before.
In another, he had said that a Party boss should say to the
professionals, "I follow, you lead."  In yet another, he had outlined
his plans for improving living standards, for allowing more freedom,
and for ending political victimization.  Comparing these documents to
the Gang of Four's actions made Deng a folk hero and brought people's
loathing of the Gang to the boiling point.  I thought incredulously:
they seem to hold the Chinese population in such contempt that they
assume we will hate Deng rather than admire him after reading these
speeches, and what is more, that we will love them!

In the university, we were ordered to denounce Deng in endless mass
meetings.  But most people showed passive resistance, and wandered
around the auditorium, or chatted, knitted, read, or even slept during
the ritual theatrics.

The speakers read their prepared scripts in flat, expressionless,
almost inaudible voices.

Because Deng came from Sichuan, there were numerous rumors about him
having been sent back to Chengdu for exile.  I often saw crowds lining
the streets because they had heard he was about to pass by.  On some
occasions the crowds numbered tens of thousands.

At the same time, there was more and more public animosity toward the
Gang of Four, also known as the Gang from Shanghai.  Suddenly bicycles
and other goods made in Shanghai stopped selling.  When the Shanghai
football team came to Chengdu they were booed all the way through the
game.  Crowds gathered outside the stadium and shouted abuse at them as
they went in and came out.

Acts of protest broke out all over China, and reached their peak during
the Tomb-Sweeping Festival in spring 1976, when the Chinese
traditionally pay their respects to the dead.  In Peking, hundreds of
thousands of citizens gathered for days on end in Tiananmen Square to
mourn Zhou with specially crafted weaths, passionate poetry readings,
and speeches.  In symbolism and language which, though coded, everyone
understood, they poured out their hatred of the Gang of Four, and even
of Mao.  The protest was crushed on the night of 5 April, when the
police attacked the crowds, arresting hundreds.  Mao and the Gang of
Four called this a "Hungarian-type counterrevolutionary rebellion."
Deng Xiaoping, who was being held incommunicado, was accused of
stage-managing the demonstrations, and was labeled "China's Nagy' (Nagy
was the Hungarian prime minister in 1956).  Mao officially fired Deng,
and intensified the campaign against him.

The demonstration may have been suppressed and ritually condemned in
the media, but the fact that it had taken place at all changed the mood
of China.  This was the first large-scale open challenge to the regime
since it was founded in 1949.

In June 1976 my class was packed off for a month to a factory in the
mountains to 'learn from the workers."  When the month was up, I went
with some friends to climb the lovely Mount Emei, "Beauty's Eyebrow,"
to the west of Chengdu.  On our way down the mountain, on 28 July, we
heard a loud transistor radio which a tourist was carrying.

I had always felt intensely annoyed by some people's insatiable love
for this propaganda machine.  And in a scenic spot!  As though our cars
had not suffered enough with all the blaring nonsense from the
ever-present loudspeakers.  But this time something caught my
attention.

There had been an earthquake at a coal-mining city near Peking called
Tangshan.  I realized it must be an unprecedented disaster, because the
media normally did not report bad news.  The official figure was
242,000 dead and 164,000 badly injured.

Although they filled the press with propaganda about their concern for
the victims, the Gang of Four warned that the nation must not be
diverted by the earthquake and forget the priority: to 'denounce Deng."
Mme Mao said publicly, "There were merely several hundred thousand
deaths.  So what?  Denouncing Deng Xiaoping concerns eight hundred
million people."  Even from Mine Mao, this sounded too outrageous to be
true, but it was officially relayed to us.

There were numerous earthquake alerts in the Chengdu area, and when I
returned from Mount Emei I went with my mother and Xiao-fang to
Chongqing, which was considered safer.  My sister, who remained in
Chengdu, slept under a massive thick oak table covered in blankets and
quilts.  Officials organized people to erect makeshift sha~, and
detailed teams to keep a round-the-clock watch on the behavior of
various animals which were thought to possess earthquake-predicting
powers.  But followers of the Gang of Four put up wall slogans barking
"Be alert to Deng Xiaoping's criminal attempt to exploit earthquake
phobia to suppress revolution!"  and held a rally to 'solemnly condemn
the capitalist-roaders who use the fear of an earthquake to sabotage
the denunciation of Deng."  The rally was a flop.

I returned to Chengdu at the beginning of September, by which time the
earthquake scare was subsiding.  On the afternoon of 9 September 1976 I
was attending an English class.  At about 2:40 we were told that there
would be an important broadcast at three o'clock that we were all to
assemble in the courtyard to listen.  We had had to do such things
before, and I walked outside in a state of irritation.

It was a typically cloudy autumn Chengdu day.  I heard the rustling of
bamboo leaves along the walls.  Just before three, while the
loudspeaker was making scratching noises as it tuned up, the Party
secretary of our department took up a position in front of the
assembly.

She looked at us sadly, and in a low, halting voice, choked out the
words: "Our Great Leader Chairman Mao, His Venerable Reverence
[ta-lao-ren-jia] has..."

Suddenly, I realized that Mao was dead.

28.  Fighting to Take Wing (1976-1978)

The news filled me with such euphoria that for an instant I was numb.
My ingrained self-censorship immediately started working: I registered
the fact that there was an orgy of weeping going on around me, and that
I had to come up with some suitable performance.  There seemed nowhere
to hide my lack of correct emotion except the shoulder of the woman in
front of me, one of the student officials, who was apparently
heartbroken.  I swiftly buried my head in her shoulder and heaved
appropriately.  As so often in China, a bit of ritual did the trick.
Sniveling heartily she made a movement as though she was going to turn
around and embrace me I pressed my whole weight on her from behind to
keep her in her place, hoping to give the impression that I was in a
state of abandoned grief.

In the days after Mao's death, I did a lot of thinking.  I knew he was
considered a philosopher, and I tried to think what his 'philosophy'
really was.  It seemed to me that its central principle was the need or
the desire?  for perpetual conflict.  The core of his thinking seemed
to be that human struggles were the motivating force of history and
that in order to make history 'class enemies' had to be continuously
created en masse.  I wondered whether there were any other philosophers
whose theories had led to the suffering and death of so many.  I
thought of the terror and misery to which the Chinese population had
been subjected.  For what?

But Mao's theory might just be the extension of his personality.  He
was, it seemed to me, really a restless fight promoter by nature, and
good at it.  He understood ugly human instincts such as envy and
resentment, and knew how to mobilize them for his ends.  He ruled by
getting people to hate each other.  In doing so, he got ordinary
Chinese to carry out many of the tasks undertaken in other
dictatorships by professional elites.  Mao had managed to turn the
people into the ultimate weapon of dictatorship.

That was why under him there was no real equivalent of the KGB in
China.  There was no need.  In bringing out and nourishing the worst in
people, Mao had created a moral wasteland and a land of hatred.  But
how much individual responsibility ordinary people should share, I
could not decide.

The other hallmark of Maoism, it seemed to me, was the reign of
ignorance.  Because of his calculation that the cultured class were an
easy target for a population that was largely illiterate, because of
his own deep resentment of formal education and the educated, because
of his megalomania, which led to his scorn for the great figures of
Chinese culture, and because of his contempt for the areas of Chinese
civilization that he did not understand, such as architecture, art, and
music, Mao destroyed much of the country's cultural heritage.  He left
behind not only a brutalized nation, but also an ugly land with lit He
of its past glory remaining or appreciated.

The Chinese seemed to be mourning Mao in a heartfelt fashion.  But I
wondered how many of their tears were genuine.  People had practiced
acting to such a degree that they confused it with their true feelings.
Weeping for Mao was perhaps just another programmed act in their
programmed lives.

Yet the mood of the nation was unmistakably against continuing Mao's
policies.  Less than a month after his death, on 6 October, Mme Mao was
arrested, along with the other members of the Gang of Four.  They had
no support from anyone not the army, not the police, not even their own
guards.  They had had only Mao.  The Gang of Four had held power only
because it was really a Gang of Five.

When I heard about the ease with which the Four had been removed, I
felt a wave of sadness.  How could such a small group of second-rate
tyrants ravage 900 million people for so long?  But my main feeling was
joy.  The last tyrants of the Cultural Revolution were finally gone. My
rapture was widely shared.  Like many of my countrymen, I went out to
buy the best liquors for a celebration with my family and friends, only
to find the shops out of stock there was so much spontaneous
rejoicing.

There were official celebrations as well exactly the same kinds of
rallies as during the Cultural Revolution, which infuriated me.  I was
particularly angered by the fact that in my department, the political
supervisors and the student officials were now arranging the whole
show, with unperturbed self-righteousness.

The new leadership was headed by Mao's chosen successor, Hua Guofeng,
whose only qualification, I believed, was his mediocrity.  One of his
first acts was to announce the construction of a huge mausoleum for Mao
on Tiananmen Square.  I was outraged: hundreds of thousands of people
were still homeless after the earthquake in Tangshan, living in
temporary shacks on the pavements.

With her experience, my mother had immediately seen that a new era was
beginning.  On the day after Mao's death she had reported for work at
her depas'uuent.  She had been at home for five years, and now she
wanted to put her energy to use again.  She was given a job as the
number seven deputy director in her department, of which she had been
the director before the Cultural Revolution.  But she did not mind.

To me in my impatient mood, things seemed to go on as before.  In
January 1977, my university course came to an end.  We were given
neither examinations nor degrees.

Although Mao and the Gang of Four were gone, Mao's rule that we had to
return to where we had come from still applied.  For me, this meant the
machinery factory.  The idea that a university education should make a
difference to one's job had been condemned by Mao as 'training
spiritual aristocrats."

I was desperate to avoid being sent back to the factory.

If that happened, I would lose any chance of using my English: there
would be nothing to translate, and no one to speak the language with.
Once again, I turned to my mother.  She said there was only one way
out: the factory had to refuse to take me back.  My friends at the
factory persuaded the management to write a report to the Second Bureau
of Light Industry saying that, although I was a good worker, they
realized they should sacrifice their own interests for a greater cause:
our motherland would benefit from my English.

After this florid letter went off, my mother sent me to see the chief
manager of the bureau, a Mr.  Hui.  He had been a colleague of hers,
and had been very fond of me when I was a baby.  My mother knew he
still had a soft spot for me.  The day after I went to see him, a board
meeting of his bureau was convened to discuss my case.  The board
consisted of some twenty directors, all of whom had to meet to make any
decision, however trivial.  Mr.  Hui managed to convince them that I
should be given a chance to use my English, and they wrote a formal
letter to my university.

Although my depa~iment had given me a hard time, they needed teachers,
and in January 19771 became an assistant lecturer in English at Sichuan
University.  I had mixed feelings about working there, as I would have
to live on the campus, under the eyes of political supervisors and
ambitious and jealous colleagues.  Worse, I soon learned that I was not
to have anything to do with my profession for a year.  A week after my
appointment I was sent to the countryside on the outskirts of Chengdu,
as part of my 'reeducation' program.

I labored in the fields and sat through endless tedious meetings.
Boredom, dissatisfaction, and the pressure put on me for not having a
fiance at the advanced age of twenty-five helped push me into
infatuations with a couple of men.  One of them I had never met, but he
wrote me beautiful letters.  I fell out of love the moment I set eyes
on him.  The other, Hou, had actually been a Rebel leader.

He was a kind of product of the times: brilliant and unscrupulous.  I
was dazzled by his charm.

Hou was detained in the summer of 1977 when a campaign started to
apprehend 'the followers of the Gang of Four."  These were defined as
the 'heads of the Rebels' and anyone who had engaged in criminal
violence, which was vaguely described as including torture, murder, and
destruction or looting of state property.  The campaign petered out
within months.  The main reason was that Mao was not repudiated, nor
was the Cultural Revolution as such.  Anyone who had done evil simply
claimed that they had acted out of loyalty to Mao.  There were no clear
criteria to judge criminality either, except in the case of the most
blatant murderers and torturers.  So many had been involved in house
raids, in destroying historical sites, antiques, and books, and in the
factional fighting.  The greatest horror of the Cultural Revolution the
crushing repression which had driven hundreds of thousands of people to
mental breakdown, suicide, and death was carried out by the population
collectively.  Almost everyone, including young children, had
participated in brutal denunciation meetings.  Many had lent a hand in
beating the victims.  What was more, victims had often become
victimizers, and vice versa.

There was also no independent legal system to investigate and to judge.
Party officials decided who was to be punished and who was not.
Personal feelings were often the decisive factor.  Some Rebels were
rightly punished.

Some got rough justice.  Others were let off lightly.  Of my father's
main persecutors, nothing happened to Zuo, and MrsShau was simply
transferred to a slightly less desirable job.

The Tings had been detained since 1970, but were not now brought to
justice because the Party had not issued criteria by which they could
be judged.  The only thing that happened to them was having to sit
through nonviolent meetings at which victims could 'speak bitterness'
against them.  My mother spoke at one such mass meeting about how the
couple had persecuted my father.  The Tings were to remain in detention
without trial until 1982, when Mr.  Ting was given twenty years'
imprisonment and Mrs.  Ting seventeen.

Hou, over whose detention I had lost much sleep, was soon set free. But
the bitter emotions reawakened in those brief days of reckoning had
killed whatever feeling I had for him.  Although I was never to know
his exact responsibility, it was clear that as a mass Red Guard leader
in the most savage years he could not possibly have been guiltless.

I still could not make myself hate him personally, but I was no longer
sorry for him.  I hoped that justice would be done to him, and to all
those who deserved it.

When would that day come?  Could justice ever be done?

And could this be achieved without more bitterness and animosity being
stirred up, given that there was so much steam already?  All around me,
factions that had fought bloody wars against each other now cohabited
under the same roof.  Capitalist-roaders were obliged to work side by
side with former Rebels who had denounced and tormented them.  The
country was still in a state of extreme tension.  When, if ever, would
we be rid of the nightmare cast by Mao?

In July 1977 Deng Xiaoping was rehabilitated again and made deputy to
Hua Guofeng.  Every speech by Deng was a blast of fresh air.  Political
campaigns were to end.  Political 'studies' were 'exorbitant taxes and
levies' and must be stopped.  Party policies must be based on reality,
not dogma.  And most importantly, it was wrong to follow every word of
Mao's to the letter.  Deng was changing China's course.  Then I started
to suffer from anxiety: I so feared that this new future might never
come to pass.

In the new spirit of Deng, the end of my sentence in the commune came
in December 1977, one month short of the original one-year schedule.
This difference of a mere month thrilled me beyond reason.  When I got
back to Chengdu, the university was about to hold belated entrance
examinations for 1977, the first proper examinations since 1966.  Deng
had declared that university entrance must be through academic exams,
not the back door.  The autumn term had had to be postponed because of
the need to prepare the population for the change from Mao's
policies.

I was sent to the mountains of northern Sichuan to interview applicants
for my department.  I went willingly.  It was on this trip, traveling
from county to county on the meandering dusty roads, all on my own,
that a thought first occurred to me: how wonderful it would be to go
and study in the West!

A few years before, a friend of mine had told me a story.

He had originally come to 'the motherland' from Hong Kong in 1964, but
had not been allowed out again until 1973, when, in the openness
following Nixon's visit, he was permitted to go and see his family.  On
his first night in Hong Kong, he heard his niece on the phone to Tokyo
arranging a weekend there.  His apparently inconsequential story had
become a permanent source of perturbation to me.  This freedom to see
the world, a freedom I could not dream of, tormented me.  Because it
had been impossible, my desire to go abroad had always remained firmly
imprisoned in my subconscious.  There had been odd scholarships to the
West at some other universities in the past, but, of course, the
candidates had all been chosen by the authorities, and Party membership
was a prerequisite.

I had no chance, being neither a Party member nor trusted by my
department, even if a scholarship were to fall from heaven onto my
university.  But now it began to bud somewhere in my mind that since
exams were back, and China was shedding its Maoist straitjacket, I
might have a chance.

Hardly had I begun to dream this than I forced myself to kill the idea,
I was so afraid of the inevitable disappointment.

When I came back from my trip, I heard that my department had been
given a scholarship for a young or middleaged teacher to go to the
West.  And they had decided on someone else.

It was Professor Lo who told me the devastafng news.

She was in her early seventies and walked unsteadily with a stick, but
was nonetheless perky and almost impetuously quick in every other way.
She spoke English rapidly, as if she was impatient to get out all the
things she knew.  She had lived in the United States for about thirty
years.  Her father had been a Kuomintang high court judge, and had
wanted to give her a Western upbringing.  In America she had taken the
name Lucy, and had fallen in love with an American student called Luke.
They planned to get married, but when they told Luke's mother, she
said, "Lucy, I like you very much.  But what would your children look
like?  It would be very difficult .... '

Lucy broke with Luke because she was too proud to be accepted into his
family with reluctance.  At the beginning of the 195os, after the
Communists took over, she went back to China, thinking that at last the
dignity of the Chinese would be restored.  She never got over Luke, and
entered into a very late marriage with a Chinese professor of English,
whom she did not love, and they quarreled nonstop.  They had been
thrown out of their apa,iment during the Cultural Revolution and were
living in a tiny room, about ten feet by eight, crammed with fading old
papers and dusty books.  It was heart-rending to see this frail
white-haired couple, unable to bear each other, one sitting on the edge
of their double bed, the other on the only chair that could be squeezed
into the room.

Professor Lo became very fond of me.  She said she saw in me her own
vanished youth of fifty years before when she had also been restless,
wanting happiness out of life.

She had failed to find it, she told me, but she wanted me to succeed.
When she heard about the scholarship to go abroad, probably to America,
she was terribly excited, but also anxious because I was away and could
not stake my claim.  The place went to a Miss Yee, who had been one
year ahead of me and was now a Party official.  She and the other young
teachers in my deparhnent who had been graduated since the Cultural
Revolution had been put in a training scheme to improve their English
while I was in the countryside.  Professor Lo was one of their tutors;
she taught partly by using articles from English-language publications
she had procured from friends in the more open cities like Peking and
Shanghai (Sichuan was still completely closed to foreigners).  Whenever
I was back from the country, I sat in on her classes.

One day the text was about the use of atomic energy in US industry.
After Professor Lo explained the meaning of the article, Miss Yee
looked up, straightened her back, and said with great indignation,
"This article has to be read critically!  How can the American
imperialists use atomic energy peacefully?"  I felt my irritation
flaring up at Miss Yee's parroting of the propaganda line.  Impulsively
I retorted, "But how do you know they can't.}' Miss Yee and most of the
class stared at me incredulously.  To them, a question like mine was
still inconceivable, even blasphemous.  Then I saw the sparkle in
Professor Lo's eyes, the smile of appreciation that only I could
detect.  I felt understood and for lifted

Besides Professor Lo, some other professors and lecturers wanted me,
not Miss Yee, to go to the West.  But although they had begun to be
respected in the new climate, none of them had any say.  If anyone
could help, it had to be my mother.  Following her advice, I went to
see my father's former colleagues, who were now in charge of
universities, and told them I had a complaint: since Comrade Deng
Xiaoping had said that university entrance was to be based on merit,
not the back door, surely it was wrong not to follow this procedure for
studying overseas.  I begged them to allow me a fair competition, which
meant an exam.

while my mother and I were lobbying, an order suddenly came from
Peking: for the first time since 1949, scholarships for studying in the
West were to be awarded on the basis of a national academic
examination, and it was soon to be held simultaneously in Peking,
Shanghai, and Xi'an, the ancient capital where the terra-cotta army was
later excavated.

My deparunent had to send three candidates to Xi'an.

It withdrew Miss Yee's scholarship and chose two candidates, both
excellent lecturers around the age of forty, who had been teaching
since before the Cultural Revolution.

Partly because of Peking's order to base selection on professional
ability, and partly because of the pressure from my mother's campaign,
the depa~hnent decided that the third candidate, a younger one, should
be chosen from among the two dozen people who were graduated during the
Cultural Revolution, through a written and an oral examination on x8
March.

I received the highest marks in both, although I won the oral test
somewhat irregularly.  We had to go one at a time into a room where two
examiners, Professor Lo and another elderly professor, were seated.  On
a table in front of them were some paper balls: we had to pick one and
answer the question on it in English.  Mine read: 'what are the main
points in the communiqu~ of the recent Second Plenary Session of the
Eleventh Congress of the

Communist Party of China?"  Of course I had no idea, and stood there
stupefied.  Professor Lo looked into my face and stretched out her hand
for the slip of paper.  She glanced at it and showed it to the other
professor.  Silently she put it in her pocket and motioned with her
eyes for me to pick another.  This time the question was: "Say
something about the glorious situation of our socialist motherland."

Years of compulsory exaltation of the glorious situation of my
socialist motherland had bored me sick, but this time I had plenty to
say.  In fact, I had just written a rapturous poem about the spring of
x 978.  Deng Xiaoping's right-hand man, Hu Yaobang, had become head of
the Party's organization Department, and had begun the process of
clearing all sorts of' class enemies' en masse.  The country was
palpably shaking off Maoism.  Industry was going at full blast and
there were many more goods in the shops.  Schools, hospitals, and other
public services were working properly.  Long-banned books were being
published, and people sometimes waited outside book shops for two days
to obtain them.  There was laughter, on the streets and in people's
homes.

I began to prepare frantically for the examinations in Xi'an, which
were not quite three weeks away.  Several professors offered their
help.  Professor Lo gave me a reading list and a dozen English books,
but then decided I would not have time to read them all.  So she
briskly cleared a space on her crowded desk for her portable
typewriter, and spent the next two weeks typing out summaries of them
in English.  This, she said with a mischievous wink, was how Luke had
helped her with her examinations fifty years before, as she had
preferred dancing and parties.

The two lecturers and I, accompanied by the deputy

Party secretary, took a train to Xi'an, a day and a night's journey
away.  For most of the journey I lay on my stomach on my 'hard
sleeper," busily annotating Professor Lo's pile of notes.  No one knew
the exact number of scholarships or the countries for which the winners
were destined, as most information in China was a state secret.  But
when we arrived in Xi'an we heard that there were twenty-two people
taking the exams there, mostly senior lecturers from four provinces in
western China.  The sealed exam paper had been flown in from Peking the
day before.  There were three parts to the written exam, which took up
the morning;

one was a long passage from Roots, which we had to translate into
Chinese.  Outside the windows of the examination hall, white showers of
willow flowers swept across the April city as if in a magnificent
rhapsodic dance.  At the end of the morning, our papers were collected,
sealed, and sent straight to Peking to be marked together with the ones
done there and in Shanghai.  In the afternoon there was an oral exam.

At the end of May I was told unofficially that I had come through both
exams with distinction.  As soon as she heard the news, my mother
stepped up her campaign to get my father's name cleared.  Although he
was dead, his file still continued to decide the future of his
children.  It contained the draft verdict which said he had committed
'serious political errors."  My mother knew that even though China was
beginning to become more liberal, this would still disqualify me from
going abroad.

She lobbied my father's former colleagues, who were now back in power
in the provincial government, backing up her case with the note from
Zhou Enlai which said that my father had the right to petition Mao.
This note had been hidden with great ingenuity by my grandmother,
stitched into the cotton upper of one of her shoes.  Now, eleven years
after Zhou had given it to her, my mother decided to hand it to the
provincial authorities, who were now headed by Zhao Ziyang.

It was a propitious time Mao's spell was beginning to lose its
paralyzing power, with considerable help from Hu Yaobang, who was in
charge of rehabilitations.  On 12 June, a senior official turned up at
Meteorite Street bearing the Party's verdict on my father.  He handed
my mother a flimsy piece of paper on which it was written that Father
had been 'a good official and a good Party member."  This marked his
official rehabilitation.  It was only after this that my scholarship
was finally endorsed by the Education Ministry in Peking.

The news that I was to go to Britain reached me through excited friends
in the department before the authorities told me.  People who barely
knew me felt hugely pleased for me, and I received many letters and
telegrams of congratulations.  Celebration parties were thrown, and
many tears of joy were shed.  It was a gigantic thing to go to the
West.  China had been closed for decades, and everyone felt stifled by
the airlessness.  I was the first person from my university and, as far
as I know, the first person from the whole of Sichuan (which then had a
population of about ninety million) to be allowed to study in the West
since 1949.  And I had earned this on professional merit I was not even
a Party member.  It was another sign of the dramatic changes sweeping
the country.  People saw hope and opportunities opening up.

But I was not entirely overwhelmed with excitement.  I had achieved
something so desirable and so unobtainable for everyone else around me
that I felt guilty toward my friends.  To show elation seemed
embarrassing or even cruel to them, but to conceal it would have been
dishonest.

So subconsciously I opted for a subdued mood.  I also felt sad when I
thought about how narrow and monolithic

China was so many people had been denied opportunities and their
talents had had no outlet.  I knew that I was lucky to come from a
privileged family, much though it had suffered.  Now that a more open
and fair China was on its way, I was impatient for change to come
faster and transform the whole society.

Wrapped up in my own thoughts, I went through the inescapable rigmarole
connected with leaving China in those days.  First I had to go to
Peking for a special training course for people going abroad.  We had a
month of

Fighting to Take Wing 67x indoctrination sessions, followed by a month
traveling around China.  The point was to impress us with the beauty of
the motherland so we would not contemplate defecting.

All the arrangements for going abroad were made for us, and we were
given a clothing allowance.  We had to look smart for the foreigners.

The Silk River meandered past the campus, and I often wandered along
its banks on my last evenings.  Its surface glimmered in the moonlight
and the hazy mist of the summer night.  I contemplated my twenty-six
years.  I had experienced privilege as well as denunciation, courage as
well as fear, seen kindness and loyalty as well as the depths of human
ugliness.  Amid suffering, ruin, and death, I had above all known love
and the indestructible human capacity to survive and to pursue
happiness.

All sorts of emotions swept over me, particularly when I thought of my
father, as well as my grandmother and Aunt Jun-ying.  Until then I had
tried to suppress my memories of them, as their deaths had remained the
most painful spot in my heart.  Now I pictured how delighted and proud
they would be for me.

I flew to Peking and was to travel with thirteen other university
teachers, one of whom was the political supervisor.  Our plane was due
to leave at 8 p.m. on 11 September 1978, and I almost missed it,
because some friends had come to say goodbye at Peking Airport and I
did not feel I should keep looking at my watch.  When I was finally
slumped in my seat, I realized I had hardly given my mother a proper
hug.  She had come to see me off at Chengdu Airport, almost casually,
with no trace of tears, as though my going half a globe away was just
one more episode in our eventful lives.

As I left China farther and farther behind, I looked out of the window
and saw a great universe beyond the plane's silver wing.  I took one
more glance over my past life, then turned to the future.  I was eager
to embrace the world.

Epilogue

I have made London my home.  For ten years, I avoided thinking about
the China I had left behind.  Then in 1988, my mother came to England
to visit me.  For the first time, she told me the story of her life and
that of my grandmother.  When she returned to Chengdu, I sat down and
let my own memory surge out and the unshed tears flood my mind.  I
decided to write Wild Swans.  The past was no longer too painful to
recall because I had found love and fulfillment and therefore
tranquillity.

China has become an altogether different place since I left.  At the
end of 1978, the Communist Party dumped Mao's 'class struggle."  Social
outcasts, including the 'class enemies' in my book, were rehabilitated;
among them were my mother's friends from Manchuria who had been branded
counterrevolution ari in 1955.  Official discrimination against them
and their families stopped.  They were able to leave their hard
physical labor, and were given much better jobs.  Many were invited
into the Communist Party and made officials.  Yu-lin, my great-uncle,
and his wife and children were allowed back to Jinzhou from the
countryside in 198o.  He became the chief accountant in a medicine
company, and she the headmistress of a kindergarten.

674 Epilogue

Verdicts clearing the victims were drawn up and lodged in their files.
The old incriminating records were taken out and burned.  In every
organization across China, bonfires were lit to consume these flimsy
pieces of paper that had ruined countless lives.

My mother's file was thick with suspicion about her teenage connections
with the Kuomintang.  Now all the dan ming words went up in flames.  In
their place was a two-page verdict dated zo December 1978, which said
in unambiguous terms that the accusations against her were false.  As a
bonus, it redefined her family background:

rather than the undesirable 'warlord," it now became the more innocuous
'doctor."

In 1982, when I decided to stay in Britain, it was still a very
unusutal choice.  Thinking it might cause dilemmas in her job, my
mother applied for early retirement, and was granted it, in 1983.  But
a daughter living in the West did not bring her trouble, as would
certainly have been the case under Mao.

The door of China has been opening wider and wider.

My three brothers are all in the West now.  Jin-ming, who is an
internationally recognized scientist in a branch of solid-state
physics, is carrying out research at Southampton University in England.
Xiao-her, who became a journalist after leaving the air force, works in
London.  Both of them are married, with a child each.  Xiao-fang
obtained a master's degree in international trade from Strasbourg
University in France, and is now a businessman with a French company.

My sister, Xiao-hong, is the only one of us still in China.

She works in the administration of the Chengdu College of Chinese
Medicine.  When a private sector was first allowed in the 198os, she
took a two-year leave of absence to help set up a clothes design
company, which was something she had set her heart on.  When her leave
was up, she had to choose between the excitement and risk of private
business and the routine and security of her state

Epilogue 675

post.  She chose the latter.  Her husband, Specs, is an executive in a
local bank.

Communication with the outside world has become part of everyday life.
A letter gets from Chengdu to London in a week.  My mother can send me
faxes from a downtown post office.  I phone her at home, direct dial,
from wherever I am in the world.  There is filtered foreign media news
on television every day, side by side with official propaganda.

Major world events, including the revolutions and upheavals in Eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union, are reported.

Between 1983 and 1989, I went back to visit my mother every year, and
each time I was overwhelmed by the dramatic diminution of the one thing
that had most characterized life under Mao: fear.

In spring 1989 I traveled around China researching this book.  I saw
the buildup of demonstrations from Chengdu to Tiananmen Square.  It
struck me that fear had been forgotten to such an extent that few of
the millions of demonstrators perceived danger.  Most seemed to be
taken by surprise when the army opened fire.  Back in London, I could
hardly believe my eyes when I saw the killing on television.  Was it
really ordered by the same man who had been to me and to so many others
a liberator?

Fear made a tentative comeback, but without the all pervasive and
crushing force of the Maoist days.  In political meetings today, people
openly criticize Party leaders by name.  The course of liberalization
is irreversible.  Yet Mao's face still stares down on Tiananmen
Square.

The economic reforms of the 198os brought an unprecedented rise in the
standard of living, par fly thanks to foreign trade and investmenc
Everywhere in China officials and citizens greet businessmen from
abroad with overflowing eagerness.  In 1988, on a trip to Jinzhou, my

surrounded by a flattering crowd to whom he was showing off photographs

responsible for her arrest.

Burps:

"It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of this book."  Mary
Wesley

"Of all the personal histories to have emerged out of China's
twentieth-century nightmare, WILD SWANS is the most deeply thoughtful
and the most heart-rending I've read.  It moves, in part, like a
ghastly oriental fairytale, but the authority and the reticent passion
with which Jung Chang speaks her memories and those of others is
unmistakable."  Colin Thubron, SPECTATOR

"WILD SWANS' is a very unusual masterpiece.  Everything about it is
extraordinary.  Not only has it been a popular bestseller, because it
is impossible to put down; it has also received the most serious
critical attention.  The book arouses all the emotions, such s pity and
terror, that great tragedy is supposed to evoke, and also a complex
mixture of admiration, despair and delight at seeing a luminous
intelligence directed at the heart of darkness."  - Minette Marrin,

SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

"Mesmerising.  Like all great stories of survival, no matter what
tragedies and horrors are encountered along the way, WILD SWANS is
ultimately an uplifting book: it is the courage and spirit of this
family which will, I believe, be my abiding impression (even if
memories of the horrors endured will take

(even if memories of the horrors endured will take a long time to
fade)."  Antonia Fraser.  THE TIMES

Immensely moving and unsettling: an unforgettable portrait of the
brain-death of a nation."  J.G. Ballard: SUNDAY TIMES
"A quite exceptional book.  Jung Chang is the classic storyteller,
describing in measured tones the almost unbelievable."

PENELOPE FITZGERALD, London Review of Books "Wild Swans has stayed in my mind all year.  Quite unforgettable."

MICHAEL IGNATIEFF, Times Literary Supplement

"An extraordinary story, popular history at its most compelling.

Her readiness to record life's small pleasures as well as its looming
horrors is not only an index of Jung Chang's honesty and good humour,
it is a part of what makes Wild Swans so fascinating.  To compare
Wild Swans to sagas of the kind that fill the bestseller lists may seem
to trivialise the real and deadly seriousness of its subject matter,
but the book offers many of the pleasures of good historical fiction."
LUCY HUGHES-HAL LET Independent

"Remarkable.  A truly splendid book."

CLARE HOLLINGWORTH, Dai~ Telegraph "Wild Swans made me feel like a
five-year-old.  This is a family memoir that has the breadth of the
most enduring social history."

MARTIN Aais, Independent on Sunday

"Riveting, an extraordinary epic.  A work of true, living history
drawing deep on family memories, an un matchable insight into the
making of modern China and the impact of war and totalitarianism on the
destinies of a quarter of the human race."

RICHARD HELLER~ Mail on Sunday

"An extraordinary tale, a loving family saga told against a background
of chaos and death rarely equalled in this century.  Wild Swans is
about how people cope with the unimaginable, and how some, in spite of
the horror, manage to remain human.  It is a remarkable book." CAROLINE
MOORE HEAD Ntw Startsman "This real-life saga of a Chinese family over
three generations contains more domestic drama than Dynast, more
violence than any film noir, more heart-rending tragedy than Little
Dottit and more ironic twists and turns and villains on the make than
any Balzacian fresco.  Almost casually, Jung Chang introduces us to a
world where personal insecurity, sudden ruin and the possibility of
torture and violent death are as perfunctorily taken for granted as
tomorrow's thunderstorm.  There has never been a book like this."

EDWARD BEHI~ Los Angeles Times

"If you care at all about the history of China in the twentieth century
or even if you don't, come to think of it Wild Swans is riveting.

It's blindingly good: a mad adventure story, a fairy tale of courage, a
tall tale of atrocities and incidentally a meditation on how men will
never understand women and vice versa.  This is calm and measured
history, but it reads like a bestseller.  You can't, as they say, put
it down."  CAROLYN SEE, New York Newsday

"If there remains the slightest doubt about the tragic quality of life
in the China of this century, this memoir should put it definitively to
rest."  JUDITH SHAPIRO, Washington Post

"Makes visible, intimate and immediate the pain and horror that are
cloaked in the silence of China's recent history."

 Preface to
 Dame Juliana Berners’ Treatyse on Fysshynge
 wyth an Angle.


The scholarly angler is here presented with an exact _facsimile_
of the first English treatise on fishing. The book is of extreme
interest for several reasons, not the least curious being that it
has served as a literary quarry to so many succeeding writers on
fishing, who have not disdained to adapt the authoress’s sentiments
to their own use, and even to borrow them word for word without
acknowledgment. Walton himself was evidently familiar with it, and
has clearly taken his “jury of flies” from its “xij flyes wyth
whyche ye shall angle to y^e trought & grayllyng;” while Burton,
that universal plunderer, has extracted her eloquent eulogy on the
secondary pleasures of angling for incorporation with the patchwork
structure of his “Anatomy of Melancholy.” Besides giving the earliest
account of the art of fishing, the estimate which the authoress forms
of the moral value of the craft is not only very high, but has served
to strike the keynote for all subsequent followers of the art both
in their praises and their practice of it. To this little treatise
more than to any other belongs the credit of having assigned in
popular estimation to the angler his meditative and gentle nature.
Many pure and noble intellects have kindled into lasting devotion
to angling on reading her eloquent commendation of it. Such men as
Donne, Wotton, and Herbert, Paley, Bell, and Davy, together with many
another excellent and simple disposition, have caught enthusiasm
from her lofty sentiments, and found that not their bodily health
only, but also their morals, were improved by angling. It became a
school of virtues, a quiet pastime in which, while looking into their
own hearts, they learnt lessons of the highest wisdom, reverence,
resignation, and love—love of their fellow-men, of the lower
creatures, and of their Creator.

Nothing definite is known of the reputed authoress, Dame Juliana
Barnes or Berners. She is said to have been a daughter of Sir James
Berners of Roding Berners in the county of Essex, a favourite of King
Richard the Second, who was beheaded in 1388 as an evil counsellor
to the king and an enemy to the public weal. She was celebrated
for her extreme beauty and great learning, and is reported to have
held the office of prioress of the Benedictine Nunnery of Sopwell
in Hertfordshire, a cell to the Abbey of St. Alban, but of this
no documentary evidence exists. The first edition of her “Book of
St. Alban’s,” printed by the schoolmaster-printer of St. Alban’s
in 1486, treats of hawking, hunting, and coat-armour. In the next
edition, “Enprynted at Westmestre by Wynkyn the Worde the yere
of thyncarnacōn of our lorde. M . CCCC . lxxxxvi,” among the other
“treatyfes perteynynge to hawkynge & huntynge with other dyuers
playsaunt materes belongynge vnto noblesse,” appeared the present
treatise on angling. The aristocratic instincts of the authoress
prompted this mode of publication, as she herself explains in the
concluding paragraph—“by cause that this present treatyse sholde not
come to the hondys of eche ydle persone whyche wolde desire it yf it
were enprynted allone by itself & put in a lytyll plaunflet, therfore
I haue compylyd it in a greter volume of dyuerse bokys concernynge
to gentyll & noble men to the entent that the forsayd ydle persones
whyche sholde haue but lytyll mesure in the sayd dysporte of
fysshyng sholde not by this meane vtterly dystroye it.” The present
publication is the “little pamphlet” which was enclosed in this
“greater volume.” An edition of it as a distinct treatise appears to
have been issued by Wynkyn de Worde soon after that of 1496, with the
title, “Here begynnyth a treatyse of fysshynge wyth an Angle” over
the curious woodcut of the man fishing which is on the first page
of the present _facsimile_, but only one copy of it is known to be
in existence. At least ten more editions appeared before the year
1600. This shows the great popularity of the book at the time of its
publication, and considering how human nature remains the same, and
the charms of angling are equally grateful to every fresh generation
of anglers, affords a sufficient reason for the strong antiquarian
delight which all literary anglers of the present century have felt
in the book. It is worth while briefly to trace the bibliography of
angling onwards until the appearance in 1653 of Walton’s _Compleat
Angler_, when the reader will be on familiar ground. In the interval
of more than a hundred and fifty years between these two names of
Berners and Walton, so deeply reverenced by every true scholar of
the craft, there occur but four books on angling, though each one
of these possesses a fame peculiar to itself. First came Leonard
Mascall’s _Booke of Fishing with Hooke and Line_, published in 1590.
Taverner’s Certaine _Experiments concerning Fish and Fruite_ followed
in 1600. Then came in 1613 the _Secrets of Angling_ of the celebrated
angling poet, J. D. [John Dennys], whose verses have perhaps never
yet been surpassed; and finally, in 1651, appeared Barker’s _Art of
Angling_. With this fisherman and “ambassador’s cook,” as he calls
himself, Walton must often have conversed.

It is a further testimony to the attractions which angling has
always possessed for contemplative natures that the art appears here
systematised, so to speak, as early as the middle of the fifteenth
century in England, where it has been practised ever since with more
enthusiasm and skill than in other countries. There is a sad gap in
angling literature from the days of Ausonius, at the commencement of
the fourth century, to those of Dame Juliana Berners. Fly-fishing,
indeed, is not named between the time of Ælian and that of the
Treatyse. It is clearly described by the former writer, who alone
among the ancients mentions it, but in the present book it is spoken
of under the term “angling with a dubbe,” as if it were well-known
and practised. Not only so, but it is clear that the writer had books
of angling lore before her, perhaps monkish manuscripts, as Hawkins
suggests, which would be of inestimable interest could they now be
recovered. Thus in speaking of the carp, the reader will find she
writes—“as touchynge his baytes I haue but lytyll knowlege of it. And
me were loth to wryte more than I knowe & haue prouyd. But well I
wote that the redde worme & the menow ben good baytys for hym at all
tymes as I haue herde saye of persones credyble & also founde wryten
in bokes of credence.” No better rules can be given for fly-fishing
at present than the two which she prescribes for angling—“for the
fyrste and pryncypall poynt in anglynge : kepe y^e euer fro the water
fro the sighte of the fysshe,” and “also loke that ye shadow not the
water as moche as ye may.” The “troughte” is to be angled for “wyth a
dubbe” [artificial fly] “in lepynge time;” but as for the salmon, “ye
may take hym : but it is seldom seen with a dubbe at suche tyme as
whan he lepith in lyke fourme & manere as ye doo take a troughte or a
gryalynge.” With the imperfect tackle and clumsy rod of those days,
it is no wonder that the capture of salmon with a fly, which is still
the crowning achievement of the craft, could seldom be effected.

After the eloquent pleading for angling with which the treatise
opens, the lady at once proceeds to teach the making of the “harnays”
of it. The rod she orders to be constructed somewhat resembles, save
in its larger size, the modern walking-stick rod. A hazel wand, or
failing it, one of willow or mountain ash, is to be procured, as
thick as the arm and nine feet in length. This is to form the butt,
and is to be hollowed out by means of divers red-hot irons into a
tapering hole, which is to receive the “croppe,” or top, as we now
call it, when not in use. This “croppe” is to be made of a yard of
hazel, joined to a length of blackthorn, crab, medlar, or “jenypre.”
All these are to be cut between Michaelmas and Candlemas, the lady
giving very particular directions as to their drying and the like.
When the two portions of the “crop” are “fretted together,” the whole
rod is to be shaved into a shapely taper form; the staff encircled
with long hoops of iron or latten at both ends, and finished with a
“pyke in the nether ende fastnyd wyth a rennynge vyce : to take in
& oute youre croppe.” The line is then to be wound round the crop
and tied fast with a bow at the top. The reader will note that there
is no mention of a reel; it was only used, seemingly until the
beginning of this century, for large salmon and pike. An angler who
hooked a fish when armed with this ponderous rod (which must from
its description have been nearly eighteen feet long, as large as a
modern salmon rod), would act as Izaak Walton would have done in the
like predicament,—throw the rod in to the fish and recover it when he
could. But the lady is wonderfully pleased with this mighty rod, and
thus concludes—“Thus shall ye make you a rodde soo preuy that ye maye
walke therwyth : and there shall noo man wyte where abowte ye goo.
It woll be lyghte & full nymbyll to fysshe wyth at your luste. And
for the more redynesse loo here a fygure,” and she adds the curious
woodcut which the reader may see reproduced at page 5.

Then follow directions how to dye and make lines and hooks. There
were evidently no manufacturers of hooks in the fifteenth century:
each angler made his own. The casting of plummets and forming of
floats succeed. The six methods of angling and the mode of playing a
fish are next treated, and the latter alone shows that Dame Juliana
must herself have been a proficient in the craft. No one but a
thoroughly good fisher could have summed up the art of playing a
fish in the words—“kepe hym euer vnder the rodde, and euermore holde
hym streyghte : soo that your lyne may susteyne and beere his lepys
and his plungys wyth the helpe of your croppe & of your honde.” The
place, the time of day, and the weather in which to fish, are next
particularly described after the exactitude peculiar to fishing
manuals of the olden time. These paragraphs are well worth the
consideration of a modern angler, especially the charge, “yf the
wynde be in the Eest, that is worste For comynly neyther wynter nor
somer y^e fysshe woll not byte thenne.”

The following part of the treatise, with what baits and how to angle
for each kind of fish, together with a brief description of each,
certainly furnished Walton with a model for some of his chapters.
This portion of her book is regarded by the authoress as most
necessary to be known and proficiency in carrying out her rules “is
all the effecte of the crafte.” She adds amusingly, “for ye can
not brynge an hoke in to a fyssh mouth wythout a bayte.” A few of
the quaint receipts of her age succeed; how to keep live baits, to
make pastes and the like, ending with a rule which is often given
to flyfishers for trout at the present day: “Whan ye haue take a
grete fysshe : vndo the mawe, & what ye fynde therin make that your
bayte : for it is beste.”

Just as the authoress rises to eloquence at the beginning of the
treatise when comparing the fisher’s happy life with the toils and
troubles which too often fall to the lot of the hunter, hawker, and
fowler, so the end of these rules once more recalls her enthusiasm.
The last two pages of the book give us a portrait of her conception
of the perfect angler, and it is no presumption to say that a nobler
and truer picture has never been limned. Simplicity of disposition,
forbearance to our neighbours’ rights, and consideration for the
poor, are strongly inculcated. All covetousness in fishing or
employment of its gentle art to increase worldly gain and fill the
larder is equally condemned. She holds the highest view of angling;
that it is to serve a man for solace, and to cause the health of his
body, but especially of his soul. So she would have him pursue his
craft alone for the most part, when his mind can rise to high and
holy things, and he may serve God devoutly by saying from his heart
his customary prayer. Nor should a man ever carry his amusement to
excess, and catch too much at one time; this is to destroy his
future pleasure and to interfere with that of his neighbours. A good
sportsman too, she adds, will busy himself in nourishing the game
and destroying all vermin. So will what Walton calls “the civil,
well-governed angler” escape the vices which spring from idleness,
and enjoy the full delights of an elevating and noble recreation.
“And all those that done after this rule shall haue the blessynge of
god & saynt Petyr, whyche he theym graunte that wyth his precyous
blood vs boughte.”

“And therefore to al you that ben vertuous : gentyll : and free borne
I wryte & make this symple treatyse folowynge : by whyche ye may haue
the full crafte of anglynge to dysport you at your luste : to the
entent that your aege maye the more floure and the more lenger to
endure.”

¶ Here begynnyth the treatyse of fysshynge wyth an Angle.

++SAlamon in his parablys sayth that a good spyryte makyth a
flourynge aege / that is a fayre aege & a longe. And syth it is
soo : I aske this questyon / . whi | che ben the meanes & the

And therfore now woll I chose of foure good dispor | tes & honeste
gamys / that is to wyte : of huntynge : hawkynge : fysshynge : &
foulynge. The beste to my symple dyscrecōn why | che is
fysshynge : callyd Anglynge wyth a rodde : and a lyne {2} and an
hoke / And therof to treate as my symple wytte may suffyce : both for
the sayd reason of Salamon and also for the reason that phisyk makyth
in this wyse (¶ Si tibi deficiant medici medici tibi fiant : hec
tria mens leta labor & moderata dieta.
¶ Ye shall vnderstonde that this is for to saye / Yf a man
lacke leche or medicyne he shall make thre thynges his leche &
medycyne : and he shall nede neuer no moo. The fyrste of theym is
a mery thought. The seconde is labour not outrageoꝰ. The thyr | de
is dyete mesurable. Fyrste that yf a man wyll euer more be in mery
thoughtes and haue a gladde spyryte : he must eschewe all contraryous
company & all places of debate where he myghte haue ony occasyons of
malencoly. And yf he woll haue a labour not outrageous he must thenne
ordeyne him to his her | tys ease and pleasaunce wythout studye
pensyfnesse or trauey | le a mery occupacyon whyche maye reioyce his
herte : & in why | che his spyrytes may haue a mery delyte. And yf
he woll be dy | etyd mesurably he must eschewe all places of ryotte
whyche is cause of surfette and of syknesse / And he must drawe him
to pla | ces of swete ayre and hungry : And ete nourishable meetes
and dyffyable also.

++NOw thenne woll I dyscryue the sayd dysportes and ga | mys to
fynde the beste of theym as veryly as I can̄ / alle be it that the
ryght noble and full worthy prynce the du | ke of Yorke late callid
mayster of game hath discryued the myr | thes of huntynge lyke as
I thynke to dyscryue of it and of alle the other. For huntynge as
to myn entent is to laboryous / For the hunter must alwaye renne &
folowe his houndes : traueyllynge & swetynge full sore. He blowyth
tyll his lyppes blyster And whan he wenyth it be an hare full oft
it is an hegge hogge Thus he chasyth and wote not what. He comyth
home at euyn rayn beten pryckyd : and his clothes torne wete shode
all myry Some hounde loste : some surbat. Suche greues & many other
hapyth vnto the hunter / whyche for dyspleysaunce of theym y^t loue
it I dare not reporte. Thus truly me semyth that this is not the
beste dysporte and game of the sayd foure. The dyspor | te and game
of hawkynge is laboryous & noyouse also as me semyth. For often the
fawkener leseth his hawkes as the {3} hunter his hoūdes. Thenne
is his game & his dysporte goon. Full often cryeth he & whystelyth
tyll that he be ryght euyll a thur | ste. His hawke taketh a bowe
and lyste not ones on hym rewar | de. whan he wolde haue her for to
flee : thenne woll she bathe. with mys fedynge she shall haue the
Fronse : the Rye : the Cray and many other syknesses that brynge
theym to the Sowse. Thus by prouff this is not the beste dysporte &
game of the sa | yd foure. The dysporte & game of fowlynge me semyth
moost symple For in the wynter season the fowler spedyth not but in
the moost hardest and coldest weder : whyche is greuous. For whan
he wolde goo to his gynnes he maye not for colde. Many a gynne &
many a snare he makyth. Yet soryly dooth he fare. At morn tyde in
the dewe he is weete shode vnto his taylle. Many other suche I cowde
tell : but drede of magre makith me for to leue. Thus me semyth that
huntynge & hawkynge & also fowlynge ben so laborous and greuous that
none of theym maye perfourme nor bi very meane that enduce a man to
a me | ry spyryte : whyche is cause of his longe lyfe acordynge vnto
y^t sayd parable of Salamon. ¶ Dowteles then̄e folowyth it that it
must nedes be the dysporte of fysshynge wyth an angle. For all other
manere of fysshyng is also laborous and greuous : often makynge
folkes ful wete & colde / whyche many tymes hath be seen cause of
grete Infirmytees. But the angler maye haue no colde nor no dysease
nor angre / but yf he be causer hymself. For he maye not lese at the
moost but a lyne or an hoke : of whyche he maye haue store plentee of
his owne makynge / as this sym | ple treatyse shall teche hym. Soo
thenne his losse is not greuo | us. and other greyffes maye he not
haue / sauynge but yf ony fisshe breke away after that he is take on
the hoke / or elles that he catche nought : whyche ben not greuous.
For yf he faylle of one he maye not faylle of a nother / yf he dooth
as this treatyse techyth : but yf there be nonght in the water. And
yet atte the leest he hath his holsom walke and mery at his ease. a
swete ay | re of the swete sauoure of the meede floures : that makyth
hym hungry. He hereth the melodyous armony of fowles. He seeth the
yonge swannes : heerons : duckes : cotes and many other fou | les
wyth theyr brodes. / whyche me semyth better than alle the {4}
noyse of honndys : the blastes of hornys and the scrye of foulis
that hunters : fawkeners & foulers can make. And yf the angler take
fysshe : surely thenne is there noo man merier than he is in his
spyryte. ¶ Also who soo woll vse the game of anglynge : he must ryse
erly. whiche thyng is prouffytable to man in this wy | se / That
is to wyte : moost to the heele of his soule. For it shall cause
hym to be holy. and to the heele of his body / For it shall cause
hym to be hole. Also to the encrease of his goodys. For it shall
make hym ryche. As the olde englysshe prouerbe sayth in this wyse.
¶ who soo woll ryse erly shall be holy helthy & zely.
¶ Thus haue I prouyd in myn entent that the dysporte & game of
anglynge is the very meane & cause that enducith a man in to a mery
spyryte : Whyche after the sayde parable of Salomon & the sayd
doctryne of phisyk makyth a flourynge aege & a longe. And therfore
to al you that ben vertuous : gentyll : and free borne I wryte &

that is good. And for to knowe to make your Instrument : loo here
it is in fygure. And it shall be made of tree sauynge the bolte

++WHan ye haue as many of the lynkys as ye suppose wol suffyse for
the length of a lyne : thenne must ye knytte theym togyder wyth
a water knotte or elles a duchys knotte. And whan your knotte is
knytte : kytte of y^e voyde shor | te endes a strawe brede for the
knotte. Thus shal ye make you | re lynes fayr & fyne : and also ryght
sure for ony manere fysshe. ¶ And by cause that ye sholde knowe bothe
the water knotte & also the duchys knotte : loo theym here in fygure
caste vnto the lyknesse of the draughte.

++YE shall vnderstonde that the moost subtyll & hardyste crafte in
makynge of your harnays is for to make your hokis. For whoos makyng
ye must haue fetefyles. thyn̄ and sharpe & smalle beten : A semy
clam̄ of yren : a bender : a payr of longe & smalle tongys : an harde
knyfe somdeale thycke : an anuelde : & a lytyll hamour. ¶ And for
smalle fysshe ye shall make your hokes of the smalest quarell nedlys
that ye can fyn | de of stele / & in this wyse. ¶ Ye shall put the
quarell in a redde charkcole fyre tyll that it be of the same colour
that the fyre is. Thenne take hym out and lete hym kele : and ye shal
fynde him well alayd for to fyle. Thenne reyse the berde wyth your
knyfe / and make the poynt sharpe. Thenne alaye hym agayn : for elles
he woll breke in the bendyng. Thenne bende hym lyke to the bende
fyguryd herafter in example. And gretter hokes ye shall mabe in the

++WHan ye haue made thus your hokis : thenne must ye set theym on
your lynes acordynge in gretnesse & strength in this wyse. ¶ Ye shall
take smalle redde silke. & yf it be for a grete hoke then̄e double
it : not twynyd. And elles for sma | le hokys lete it be syngle : &
therwyth frette thycke the lyne the | re as the one ende of your hoke
shal sytte a strawe brede. Then̄ sette there your hoke : & frette
hym wyth the same threde y^e two partes of the lengthe that shall be
frette in all. And whan ye co | me to the thyrde parte thenne torne
the ende of your lyne aga | yn vpon the frette dowble. & frette it
so dowble that other thyr | de parte. Thenne put your threde in at
the hose twys or thries & lete it goo at eche tyme rounde abowte the
yerde of your hoke. Thenne wete the hose & and drawe it tyll that
it be faste. And lo | ke that your lyne lye euermore wythin your
hokys : & not with | out. Thenne kytte of the lynys ende & the threde
as nyghe as ye maye : sauynge the frette.

++NOw ye knowe wyth how grete hokys ye shall angle to euery
fysshe : now I woll tell you wyth how many heeres ye shall to euery
manere of fisshe. ¶ For the menow wyth a lyne of one heere. For the
waxyng roche the bleke & the {10} gogyn & the ruffe wy^t a lyne
of two heeris. For the darse & the grete roche wyth a lyne of thre
heeres. For the perche : the floū | der & bremet with foure heeres.
For the cheuen chubbe : the bre | me : the tenche & the ele wyth .vj.
heeres. For the troughte : gray | lynge : barbyll & the grete cheuyn
with .ix. heeres. For the grete troughte wyth .xij. heeres : For the
samon with .xv. heeres. And for the pyke wyth a chalke lyne made
browne with your brow | ne colour aforsayd : armyd with a wyre. as ye
shal here herafter whan I speke of the pyke.
¶ Your lynes must be plumbid wyth lede. And ye shall wyte y^t
the nexte pūbe vnto the hoke shall be therfro a large fote &
mo | re / And euery plumbe of a quantyte to the gretnes of the lyne.
There be thre manere of plūbis for a grounde lyne rennynge. And
for the flote set vpon the grounde lyne lyenge .x. plumbes Ioynynge
all togider. On the grounde lyne rennynge .ix. or .x. smalle. The
flote plūbe shall be so heuy y^t the leest plucke of ony fysshe
maye pull it downe in to y^e water. And make your plū | bis rounde
& smothe y^t they stycke not on stonys or on wedys. And for the more
vnderstondynge lo theym here in fygure.

[Illustration : The lyne for a pyke : ¶ Pln̄be : Corke armyd wyth

++THenne shall ye make your flotys in this wyse. Take a fayr corke
that is clene without many holes. and bore it {11} thrugh wyth a
smalle hote yren : And putt therin a penne iuste and streyghte. Euer
the more flote the gretter penne & the gre | ter hole. Thenne shape
it grete in the myddis and smalle at bo | the endys. and specyally
sharpe in the nether ende / and lyke vn | to the fygures folowynge.
And make theym smothe on a gryn | dyng stone : or on a tyle stone.
¶ And loke that the flote for one heer be nomore than a pese. For
two heeres : as a beene. for twel | ue heeres : as a walnot. And soo
euery lyne after the proporcōn. ¶ All manere lynes that ben not for
the groūde must haue flo | tes. And the rennynge grounde lyne must
haue a flote. The ly | enge grounde lyne wythout flote.

[Illustration]

++NOw I haue lernyd you to make all your harnays. Here I woll tell
you how ye shall angle. ¶ Ye shall angle : vnderstonde that there is
.vi. manere of anglyng. That one is at the grounde for the troughte
and other fisshe. A nother is at y^e grounde at an arche / or at a
stange where it ebbyth and flowyth : for bleke : roche. and darse.
The thyrde is wyth a flote for all manere of fysshe. The fourth
wyth a menow for y^e troughte wythout plumbe or flote. The fyfth is
rennynge in y^t same wyse for roche and darse wyth one or two heeres
& a flye. The syxte is wyth a dubbyd hoke for the troughte & graylyng
¶ And for the fyrste and pryncypall poynt in anglynge : kepe y^e
euer fro the water fro the sighte of the fysshe : other ferre on the
londe : or ellys behynde a busshe that the fysshe se you not. For yf
they doo they wol not byte. ¶ Also loke that ye shadow not the water
as moche as ye may. For it is that thynge that woll soone fraye the
fysshe. And yf a fysshe be afrayed he woll not bi | te longe after.
For alle manere fysshe that fede by the grounde ye shall angle for
theim to the botom. soo that your hokys shall renne or lye on the
grounde. And for alle other fysshe that fede {12} aboue ye shall
angle to theym in the myddes of the water or somdeale byneth or
somdeale aboue. For euer the gretter fisshe the nerer he lyeth the
botom of the water. And euer the smaller fysshe the more he smymmyth
aboue. ¶ The thyrde good poynt is whan the fysshe bytyth that ye be
not to hasty to smyte nor to late / For ye must abide tyll ye suppose
that the bayte be ferre in the mouth of the fysshe / and thenne abyde
noo longer. And this is for the groūde. ¶ And for the flote whan ye
se it pul | lyd softly vnder the water : or elles caryed vpon the
water softly : thenne smyte. And loke that ye neuer ouersmyte the
strengthe of your lyne for brekynge. ¶ And yf it fortune you to smyte
a grete fysshe wyth a smalle harnays : thenne ye must lede hym in the
water and labour him there tyll he be drownyd and ouercome. Thenne
take hym as well as ye can or maye. and euer bewaar that ye holde not
ouer the strengthe of your lyne. And as moche as ye may lete hym not
come out of your lynes ende streyghte from you : But kepe hym euer
vnder the rodde / and euermore holde hym streyghte : soo that your
lyne may sus | teyne and beere his lepys and his plungys wyth the
helpe of your croppe & of your honde.

++HEre I woll declare vnto you in what place of the water ye shall
angle. Ye shall angle in a pole or in a stondinge water in euery
place where it is ony thynge depe. The | re is not grete choyse of
ony places where it is ony thynge de | pe in a pole. For it is but
a pryson to fysshe. and they lyue for y^e more parte in hungre lyke
prisoners : and therfore it is the lesse maystry to take theym.
But in a ryuer ye shall angle in euery place where it is depe and
clere by the grounde : as grauell or claye wythout mudde or wedys.
And in especyall yf that there be a manere whyrlynge of water or a
couert. As an holow ban | ke : or grete rotys of trees : or longe
wedes fletyng aboue in the water where the fysshe maye couere and
hyde theymself at certayn tymes whan they lyste Also it is good for
to angle in depe styffe stremys and also in fallys of waters and
weares : and in floode gatys and mylle pyttes. And it is good for to
angle where as the water restyth by the banke : and where the streme
rennyth nyghe there by : and is depe and clere by the grounde {13}
and in ony other placys where ye may se ony fyssh houe or ha | ne ony
fedynge.

++NOw ye shall wyte what tyme of the daye ye shall angle ¶ From
the begynnynge of May vntyll it be Septem | bre the bytynge tyme
is erly by the morowe from foure of y^e clocke vnto eyghte of the
clocke. And at after none from foure of the clocke vnto eyghte of
the clocke : but not soo good as is in the mornynge. And yf it be a
colde whystelyng wynde and a derke lowrynge daye. For a derke daye is
moche better to angle in than a clere daye. ¶ From the begynnynge of
Sep | tembre vnto the ende of Apryll spare noo tyme of the daye :
¶ Also many pole fysshes woll byte beste in the none tyde.
¶ And yf ye se ony tyme of the daye the trought or graylynge
lepe : angle to hym wyth a dubbe acordynge to the same month And
where the water ebbyth and flowyth the fysshe woll byte in some
place at the ebbe : and in some place at the flood. After y^t they
haue restynge behynde stangnys and archys of brydgys and other suche
manere places.

++HEre ye shall wyte in what weder ye shall angle. as I sa | yd
before in a derke lowrynge daye whanne the wynde blowyth softly. And
in somer season whan it is brennyn | ge hote thenne it is nought.
¶ From Septembre vnto Apryll in a fayr sonny daye is ryght good
to angle. And yf the wynde in that season haue ony parte of the
Oryent : the wedyr thenne is nought. And whan it is a grete wynde.
And whan it snowith reynyth or hayllyth. or is a grete tempeste / as
thondyr or ligh | tenynge : or a swoly hote weder : thenne it is
noughte for to angle.

++NOw shall ye wyte that there ben twelue manere of ympedymentes
whyche cause a man to take noo fysshe. w^t | out other comyn that
maye casuelly happe. ¶ The fyrst is yf your harnays be not mete nor
fetly made. The seconde is yf your baytes be not good nor fyne. The
thyrde is yf that ye angle not in bytynge tyme. The fourth is yf that
the fysshe be frayed w^t the syghte of a man. The fyfth yf the water
be very thycke : whyte or redde of ony floode late fallen. The syxte
yf the fysshe styre not for colde. The seuenth yf that the wedyr
{14} be hote. The eyght yf it rayne. The nynthe yf it hayll or snow
falle. The tenth is yf it be a tempeste. The enleuenth is yf it be a
grete wynde. The twelfyfth yf the wynde be in the Eest / and that is
worste For comynly neyther wynter nor somer y^e fysshe woll not byte
thenne. The weste and northe wyndes ben good but the south is beste.

++ANd now I haue tolde you how to make your harnays : and how ye
shall fysshe therwyth in al poyntes Reason woll that ye knowe wyth
what baytes ye shall angle to euery manere of fysshe in euery moneth
of the yere / whyche is all the effecte of the crafte. And wythout
whyche baytes know | en well by you all your other crafte here toforn
auayllyth you not to purpose. For ye can not brynge an hoke in to a
fyssh mo | uth wythout a bayte. Whiche baytes for euery manere of
fyssh and for euery moneth here folowyth in this wyse.

++FOr by cause that the Samon is the moost stately fyssh that ony
man maye angle to in fresshe water. Therfore I purpose to begyn̄ at
hym. ¶ The samon is a gentyll fysshe : but he is comborous for to
take. For comynly he is but in depe places of grete ryuers. And for
the more parte he holdyth the myddys of it : that a man maye not
come at hym. And he is in season from Marche vnto Myghelmas. ¶ In
whyche season ye shall angle to hym wyth thyse baytes whan ye maye
gete theym. Fyrste wyth a redde worme in the begynnynge & endynge
of the season. And also wyth a bobbe that bredyth in a dunghyll.
And specyally wyth a souerayn bayte that bredyth on a water docke.
¶ And he bytith not at the grounde : but at y^e flote. Also ye may
take hym : but it is seldom seen with a dubbe at suche tyme as whan
he lepith in lyke fourme & manere as ye doo take a troughte or a
gryalynge. And thyse baytes ben well prouyd baytes for the samon.

++THe Troughte for by cause he is a right deyntous fyssh and also a
ryght feruente byter we shall speke nexte of hym. He is in season fro
Marche vnto Myghelmas. He is on clene grauely groūde & in a streme.
Ye may angle to hym {15} all tymes wyth a grounde lyne lyenge or
rennynge : sauyng in lepynge tyme. and thenne wyth a dubbe. And erly
wyth a rennynge grounde lyne. and forth in the daye wyth a flote
lyne.
¶ Ye shall angle to hym in Marche wyth a menew hangyd on your hoke by
the nether nesse wythout flote or plumbe : drawynge vp & downe in the
streme tyll ye fele hym taste. ¶ In the same tyme angle to hym wyth
a groūde lyne with a redde wor | me for the moost sure. ¶ In Aprill
take the same baytes : & also Inneba other wyse namyd .vij. eyes.
Also the canker that bredyth in a grete tree and the redde snayll.
¶ In May take y^e sto | ne flye and the bobbe vnder the cowe torde
and the sylke worme : and the bayte that bredyth on a fern̄ leyf.
¶ In Iuyn take a redde worme & nyppe of the heed : and put on thyn
hoke a codworme byforn. ¶ In Iuyll take the grete redde worme and the
codworme togyder. ¶ In August take a flesshe flye & the grete redde
worme and the fatte of the bakon : and bynde abowte thy hoke. ¶ In
Septembre take the redde worme and the menew. ¶ In Octobre take the
same : for they ben specyall for the trought all tymes of the yere.
From Aprill tyll Septembre y^e trough lepyth. thenne angle to hym
wyth a dubbyd hoke acordyn | ge to the moneth / whyche dubbyd hokys
ye shall fynde in then | de of this treatyse; and the monethys wyth
theym :

++THe grayllynge by a nother name callyd vmbre ia a delycyous fysshe
to mannys mouthe. And ye maye take hym lyke as ye doo the trought.
And thyse ben his bay | tes. ¶ In Marche & in Apryll the redde
worme. ¶ In May the grene worme : a lytyll breyled worme : the docke
canker. and the hawthorn worme. ¶ In Iune the bayte that bredyth
betwene the tree & the barke of an oke. ¶ In Iuyll a bayte that
bredyth on a fern̄ leyf : and the grete redde worme. And nyppe of the
he | de : and put on your hoke a codworme before. ¶ In August the
redde worme : and a docke worme. And al the yere after a reddde worme.

++THe barbyll is a swete fysshe / but it is a quasy meete & a
peryllous for mannys body. For comynly he yeuyth an introduxion to
y^e Febres. And yf he be eten rawe : he maye be cause of mannys
dethe : whyche hath oft be seen Thyse {16} be his baytes. ¶ In
Marche & in Apryll take fayr fresshe che | se : and laye it on a
borde & kytte it in small square pecys of the lengthe of your hoke.
Take thenne a candyl & brenne it on the ende at the poynt of your
hoke tyll it be yelow. And then̄e byn | de it on your hoke with
fletchers sylke : and make it rough lyke a welbede. This bayte is
good all the somer season. ¶ In May & Iune take y^e hawthorn̄ worme
& the grete redde worme. and nyppe of the heed. And put on your hoke
a codworme before. & that is a good bayte. In Iuyll take the redde
worme for cheyf & the hawthorn̄ worme togyd^r. Also the water docke
leyf wor | me & the hornet worme togyder. ¶ In August & for all
the yere take the talowe of a shepe & softe chese : of eche ylyke
moche : and a lytyll hony & grynde or stampe theym togyd^r longe. and
tempre it tyll it be tough. And put therto floure a lytyll & make it
on smalle pellettys. And y^t is a good bayte to angle wyth at the
grounde And loke that it synke in the water. or ellys it is not good
to this purpoos.

++THe carpe is a deyntous fysshe : but there ben but fewe in
Englonde. And therfore I wryte the lasse of hym. He is an euyll
fysshe to take. For he is soo stronge enarmyd in the mouthe that
there maye noo weke harnays holde hym. And as touchynge his baytes I
haue but lytyll knowlege of it And me were loth to wryte more than I
knowe & haue prouyd But well I wote that the redde worme & the menow
ben good baytys for hym at all tymes as I haue herde saye of persones
credyble & also founde wryten in bokes of credence.

++THe cheuyn is a stately fysshe & his heed is a deyty morsell. There
is noo fysshe soo strongly enarmyd wyth sca | lys on the body. And
bi cause he is a stronge byter he ha | the the more baytes / whiche
ben thyse. ¶ In Marche the redde worme at the grounde : For comynly
thenne he woll byte there at all tymes of y^e yere yf he be ony
thing
